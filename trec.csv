"b'A visual scene is rapidly segmented into the regions that are occupied by different objects and background. Segmentation may be initiated from the detection of boundaries, followed by the filling-in of the surfaces between these boundaries to render them visible. Alternatively, segmentation may be based on grouping of surface elements that are similar, so that boundaries are (implicitly) identified as the borders between elements that are grouped into objects. Here, we present recordings from awake monkey primary visual cortex that show that in late (>80 ms) components of the neural responses a correlate of boundary formation is expressed, followed by a filling-in (also called colouring) between the edges. These data favour a model of segmentation where boundary formation initiates surface filling-in.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'IL-4 plays a major role in IgE production. Its signal is conferred to effector cells through binding to the {alpha} chain of the membrane-bound human IL-4 receptor (huIL-4R{alpha}). Here we present the genomic structure and organization of huIL-4R{alpha}. The promotor region shows binding sites for several transcription factors involved in inflammatory processes. HuIL-4R{alpha} has been shown to be organized differently to that of mouse IL-4R{alpha}. A soluble form of huIL-4R{alpha} is produced by alternative splicing of the huIL-4R{alpha} gene (shuIL-4R{alpha}/splice). Expression of the corresponding mRNA coding for the extracellular part of the receptor and an additional three amino acids is also shown. A second form of huIL-4R{alpha}, i.e. shuIL-4R{alpha}/prot, is produced by limited proteolysis of the receptor (shedding) and is already known. These results reveal a complex pattern for the regulation of the IL-4 pathway at the receptor level. The patterns of expression of all three receptor proteins as well as their individual meaning in the context of inflammation still have to be elucidated'",4
"b'BackgroundAlthough vital statistics have indicated large Japanese-American differences in mortality rates for coronary heart disease (CHD), the magnitude of difference has not been documented well using comparable validation of cause of death.\r\n\r\nMethodsPopulation-based fatal CHD data were compared between the Oita Cardiac Death Survey, Japan and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, USA. Both studies (population: Oita City 198 093; the ARIC comunities 286 820) identified possible fatal CHD events (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9]: 410\x96414, 250, 401\x96402, 427\x96429, 440, and 798\x96799) among residents aged 35\x9674 years during 1992\x961993. Comparable criteria for classifying cause of death were applied. Sex-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates of CHD were calculated by place of death.\r\n\r\nResultsIn all, 330 deaths in Oita and 1398 in the ARIC communities had eligible ICD-9 death certificate codes; CHD codes (ICD-9 410\x96414) comprised 30.6% of investigated deaths in Oita and 58.6% in ARIC. For men, the non-validated rate ratio for CHD deaths (ARIC:Oita City) was 5.9 (95% CI : 4.2\x968.5), which fell to 4.7 (95% CI : 3.5\x966.4) with validation and inclusion of sudden deaths within one hour of onset as fatal CHD. For women, the overall non-validated rate ratio was 4.6 (95% CI : 2.8\x967.6), which fell to 3.9 (95% CI : 2.4\x966.3) with validation and but there was little further change when the sudden deaths were added.\r\n\r\nConclusionsOur results suggest that differences in fatal CHD rates between Japanese and Americans were not as large as suggested by vital statistics when events were validated and sudden deaths were included.'",3
"b'Galectins are a continuously expanding family of \xdf-galactoside-binding lectins present in a variety of evolutionarily divergent animal species. Here we report, for the first time, that expression of galectins extends to the reptilia lineage of lizards. Up to five lactose-binding proteins were isolated from the lizard Podarcis hispanica by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-Sepharose. The main component, which is most abundantly expressed in skin, was purified from this tissue and further characterized. Under native conditions the protein behaved as a monomer with a molecular mass of 14,500 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.3. Based on sequence homology of the 58 N-terminal amino acid residues with galectins, and on its demonstrated galactoside-binding activity, this lectin we named LG-14 (from Lizard Galectin and 14 kDa) is classified as a new member of the galectin family. LG-14 falls into and strengthen the still thinly populated category of monomeric prototype galectins.'",2
"b'We show by nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoES) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) that it is possible to observe oligosaccharide\x96protein complexes with dissociation constants in the millimolar range, such as Pk trisaccharide (globotriaoside) complexed with the Shiga-like toxin (SLT) of pathogenic E. coli. It is further demonstrated that nanoES/FT-ICR MS is an exquisite method to study quantitative aspects of the association of mono- and polyvalent oligosaccharide ligands with multimeric proteins, such as the SLTs. At increasing trisaccharide:protein ratios it was shown that the B5 toxin subunit complexes with 5 Pk trisaccharides and only after all 5 copies of site 2 are essentially filled do any of the remaining 10 receptor sites become occupied. From the distribution of bound Pk\x92s at the five binding sites, it was possible to establish association constants for each of the five sites and to confirm that binding occurs noncooperatively, the association constants for each site are identical and that compared to site 1, site 2 exhibits a tenfold higher affinity for the globotriaoside synthetic ligand 1. The facile identification of the occupancy of binding sites represents information that is not readily available by other techniques. This sensitive and rapid estimation of association constants for protein\x96ligand complexes, which are free of unpredictable secondary effects that plague enzyme linked assays, is likely to find wide application.'",2
"b'Background From an epidemiological and public health perspective there is an interest in quantifying differences in incidence and mortality between either time points, geographical areas or males and females. We propose a method for splitting such a difference in the number of cases/deaths into three components: (1) those due to risk; (2) those due to population structure (i.e. age distribution); and (3) those due to population size. We also propose graphical methods for presenting the results. Three examples are used to illustrate our methodology.\r\nTemporal and geographical trends in disease incidence and mortality provide important information to epidemiologists. However, when it comes to analysing the difference between two given time points, two geographical areas or even between the sexes there is no clear reference as to how this is done in practice with a mathematical foundation.\r\n\r\nMethods have been used that do not adjust the population leading to incorrect results.1,2 Macfarlane et al.2 present the percentage change in the crude rate and the percentage change in the number of deaths for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract in a variety of different countries. Their aim is to relate these changes to national consumption of alcohol and smoking. However, just looking at the crude rate does not provide a change in risk as structural changes have not been considered. Further they state, \x91Numbers of deaths increased in some of the countries with decreasing rates, due to an ageing of the population\x92, but no supporting analysis has been provided. Even if the rate decreases and the population size increases (e.g. doubles or triples) without affecting the structure then we could still see an increase in the absolute number of deaths and this would not be as a result of population ageing. In this situation we would recommend using the method we describe below to calculate the risk and demographic changes. In order to decide whether the structural changes are due to population ageing, one would need to study the population proportions more closely. Engeland et al.1 essentially use the same method as us but they do not adjust the populations to the same size. If the population size and structure does not change the lack of adjustment does not result in large errors. Hence the population size influences the changes due to risk and structure.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we present a method for partitioning the variation in the number of cases or deaths between two groups (or chronological dates) with respect to demographic variation on the one hand and differences in exposure to risk factors on the other. The demographic component of the variation has to be split itself into that due to variation in population size, which is trivial, and that due to the change in the population structure (i.e. age distribution) which needs more attention.'",3
"b'Background Although \xdf-carotene has shown inverse associations with chronic diseases involving free radical damage in observational epidemiological studies less attention has been paid to five other major carotenoids also showing antioxidant activity in vitro.\r\n\r\nMethods We studied the associations between 7.2-year mortality and serum levels of six carotenoids, and {alpha}-tocopherol, measured in stored serum, sampled in 1991/1992 during a health survey among 638 independently living elderly subjects aged 65\x9685 years. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause mortality for the lowest tertiles of serum vitamins with the highest tertiles, adjusting for possible confounding effects.\r\n\r\nResults During a follow-up period of 7.2 years 171 elderly died. The adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for the lowest tertiles of vitamins compared with the highest tertiles were between 1.02 and 1.73. The strongest increase in mortality risk was seen for \xdf-cryptoxanthin (1.52, 95% CI : 1.00, 2.32), lutein (1.56, 95% CI : 1.05, 2.31) and zeaxanthin (1.32, 95% CI : 0.89, 1.97) and their sum (oxygenated carotenoids: 1.73, 95% CI : 1.12, 2.67). Tests for trend were significant (P < 0.05) for all-cause mortality risk and serum levels of total carotenoids, oxygenated carotenoids and \xdf-cryptoxanthin.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our findings suggest that serum levels of individual carotenoids, particularly the oxygenated species are inversely associated with all-cause mortality and should be considered as candidates for further investigations.'",3
"b'Dendritic cells (DC) are highly motile antigen-presenting cells that are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation to antigen uptake and processing. Then, to initiate T cell-dependent immune responses, they migrate from non-lymphoid organs to lymph nodes and the spleen. Since chemokines have been involved in human DC recruitment, we investigated the role of chemokines on mouse DC migration using the mouse growth factor-dependent immature DC line (D1). In this study, we characterized receptor expression, responsiveness to chemoattractants and chemokine expression of D1 cells during the maturation process induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MIP-1{alpha} and MIP-5 were found to be the most effective chemoattractants, CCR1 was the main receptor expressed and modulated during LPS treatment, and MIP-2, RANTES, IP-10 and MCP-1 were the chemokines modulated during DC maturation. Thus, murine DC respond to a unique set of CC and CXC chemokines, and the maturational stage determines the program of chemokine receptors and chemokines that are expressed. Since CCR1 is modulated during the early phases of DC maturation, our results indicate that the CCR1 receptor may participate in the recruitment and maintenance of DC at the inflammatory site.'",4
"b'The neuronal response patterns that are required for an adequate behavioural reaction to subjectively relevant changes in the environment are commonly studied by means of oddball paradigms, in which occasional \x91target\x92 stimuli have to be detected in a train of frequent \x91non-target\x92 stimuli. The detection of such task-relevant stimuli is accompanied by a parietocentral positive component of the event-related potential, the P300. We performed EEG recordings of visual and auditory event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when healthy subjects performed an oddball task. Significant increases in fMRI signal for target versus non-target conditions were observed in the supramarginal gyrus, frontal operculum and insular cortex bilaterally, and in further circumscribed parietal and frontal regions. These effects were consistent over various stimulation and response modalities and can be regarded as specific for target detection in both the auditory and the visual modality. These results therefore contribute to the understanding of the target detection network in human cerebral cortex and impose constraints on attempts at localizing the neuronal P300 generator. This is of importance both from a neurobiological perspective and because of the widespread application of the physiological correlates of target detection in clinical P300 studies.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'In comparison to androgens, almost nothing is known about the role of endogenous oestrogens in human aggressive behaviour. This new aspect was studied in the present investigation involving men with a history of alcohol-related aggression (AGG+) and in an age-matched male control population (AGG-). Methods: Male AGG+ volunteers were recruited through advertisements and the controls were drawn from the Finnish Population Register. Alcohol misuse and interpersonal partner violence were estimated by questionnaires. Endogenous hormone levels were measured from morning plasma samples. Results: A positive association emerged between plasma oestradiol and emotional negotiation during interpersonal conflict situations. Furthermore, a negative association was observed between oestradiol and testosterone-related physical, violent, aggression in the AGG+ men. In addition, oestradiol, rather than testosterone, was positively associated with psychological aggression in both groups of men. Conclusion: It is suggested that endogenous female sex hormones may be related to empathic behaviour and could, thus, represent a counter-balancing factor in alcohol-related male aggressive behaviour. Altogether, oestrogen may represent a multifactor ingredient in the complex interactions of partner conflicts.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'To test whether a single session of Motivational Interviewing (MI) focussing on drinking alcohol, and cigarette and cannabis smoking, would successfully lead to reductions in use or problems. Methods: Naturalistic quasi-experimental study, in 162 young people (mean age 17 years) who were daily cigarette smokers, weekly drinkers or weekly cannabis smokers, comparing 59 receiving MI with 103 non-intervention assessment-only controls. MI was delivered in a single session by youth workers or by the first author. Assessment was made of changes in self-reported cigarette, alcohol, cannabis use and related indicators of risk and problems between recruitment and after 3 months by self-completion questionnaire. Results: 87% of subjects (141 of 162) were followed up. The most substantial evidence of benefit was achieved in relation to alcohol consumption, with those receiving MI drinking on average two days per month less than controls after 3 months. Weaker evidences of impact on cigarette smoking, and no evidence of impact on cannabis use, were obtained. Conclusions: Evidence of effectiveness for the delivery of MI by youth workers in routine conditions has been identified. However, the extent of benefit is much more modest than previously identified in efficacy studies.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'To assess the effect of treatment of problem drinking on injury risk, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials by searching 12 computerized databases, cross-checking bibliographies, and contacting authors and governmental agencies. We identified 19 trials of interventions for problem drinking that measured injury outcomes. Treatment for problem drinking was associated with reduced suicide attempts, domestic violence, falls, drinking-related injuries, and injury hospitalizations and deaths, with reductions ranging from 27 to 65%. Interventions among convicted drunk drivers reduced motor vehicle crashes and injuries. The precision of all the point estimates was low, however. We did not combine the results quantitatively, because the interventions, patient populations, and outcomes were so heterogeneous. The results suggest that treatment for problem drinking may reduce injuries and their antecedents. Because injuries account for much of the morbidity and mortality from problem drinking, further studies are warranted to confirm these effects.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""It is now 15 years since David Barker and colleagues published the first direct evidence that fetal growth impairment is associated with cardiovascular disease.1 Since then, despite scepticism en route, the \x91fetal programming\x92 of later disease has become established as a legitimate area for epidemiological and biological enquiry. It has spawned a new generation of studies focused mainly on cardiovascular disease and diabetes accompanied by an emerging interest in its relevance to a wide range of other outcomes from breast cancer2 to schizophrenia.3\r\n\r\nSome researchers, particularly in perinatal epidemiology, have embraced the fetal origins hypothesis seeing in it a fresh rationale for their work. This is illustrated by the paper by Raum et al.4 in this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology. They report that maternal education is inversely associated with impaired fetal growth in East as well as West Germany in the period around the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. This is an important observation in its own right, providing further demonstration of the existence of socio-economic differences in societies organized on a very different basis to those of Western Europe and North America. However, what is striking is that the authors motivate their study (in part) by stating that \x91Poor intrauterine growth ... determines human susceptibility to disease ... in later life.\x92 While this appeal to the fetal origins hypothesis is understandable it reflects the view that regardless of cause, all variation in fetal growth or size at birth leads to variation in risk of later disease. However, this is clearly not the case, as has been shown by the observation that twins, despite being lighter at birth than singletons, do not as a group have higher blood pressure5 or an increased risk of coronary heart disease.6 Intra-uterine growth is a complex outcome that is influenced by a wide range of factors including fetal genotype, maternal physiology and behaviour as well as the function of that crucial interface\x97the placenta. Whether the type of intra-uterine growth retardation seen in mothers with low education is associated with an increase in risk of later disease in the offspring is an important but unanswered question.\r\n\r\nThe role of maternal nutrition in the fetal programming debate is a particularly vexed one. The crucial distinction between fetal and maternal nutrition is one that is spelt out in the incisive contribution by Harding also in this issue of the IJE.7 She identifies some of the key problems that exist in generalizing to humans from the impressive body of work based on animal models that provides unequivocal proof of concept that manipulation of maternal nutrition can programme the physiology of offspring. The human epidemiological evidence, however, is meagre and equivocal. The results of follow-up of people in utero during the Dutch Hunger winter, while suggestive, are far from conclusive. Thus Law et al.8 in their paper in this issue of the IJE, are absolutely right in saying that \x91the long-term effects on the offspring of the promotion of nutrition and health of girls and young women deserve further study\x92. The evidence for such interventions having any substantial effect on size at birth, let alone later blood pressure or risk of cardiovascular disease is minimal. The follow-up of offspring involved in nutritional and other trials to improve pregnancy outcome is a priority for future research.9\r\n\r\nIf fetal, and even maternal nutrition, has a role in programming in humans it may be that it is the balance of particular nutrients or levels of micronutrients that are important rather than the absolute levels of macronutrients.7 While not usually considered in the fetal origins debate the crucial influence of maternal micronutrient intake in pregnancy on fetal development is exemplified by the increased risk of neural tube defects associated with maternal folate deficiency.10 It is thus interesting that the paper by Shaw et al.11 in this issue of the IJE, suggests that low maternal weight gain during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of neural tube defects even with adjustment for a host of known risk factors (including folate supplementation). However, their interpretation of this association is suitably cautious, and they suggest that carrying a fetus with a neural tube defect in itself may lead to lower weight gain. This sort of \x91reverse causality\x92 explanation could be usefully deployed in the main-stream fetal origins debate. Could it be that impaired fetal growth is a consequence of some specific environmentally induced changes in fetal development that are themselves associated with risk of later disease? In this respect, size at birth is simply an epi-phenomenon, with no direct causal role, consistent with some of the animal work that has shown that manipulations in pregnancy can programme later function in the offspring without affecting size at birth.7\r\n\r\nThe current focus on the fetal origins of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer overshadows the fact that the oldest and largest literature on \x91early\x92 and prenatal origins of later disease relates to psychological and mental disorders.12 Two other papers in this issue of the IJE can be seen as a return to these older preoccupations. Cheung et al.13 relate the development of motor skills in childhood to in utero and postnatal growth in Pakistani infants while Nilsson et al.14 look at whether birth weight is associated with performance in psychological tests used at Swedish military conscription to identify men resistant to stress.\r\n\r\nThe literature on the early life antecedents of psychological and mental disorders predates the current interest in fetal programming by many years. In the couple of decades following the end of the second world war there was considerable interest in the fetal and obstetric determinants of \x91mental disorders\x92 and \x91mental retardation\x92 in particular. Much of this earlier literature was based on a model of injury to the brain either in utero or at delivery, rather than with more subtle changes in structure and function thought to be associated with growth impairment that are central to the current models of fetal programming. In a 1955 paper on the association of maternal and fetal factors with \x91mental deficiency\x92, Pasamanick and Lilienfeld suggested that there \x91is a continuum of reproductive causality, consisting of brain damage incurred during the prenatal and paranatal periods as a result of abnormalities during these periods, leading to a gradient of injury extending from fetal and neonatal death through cerebral palsy, epilepsy, behaviour disorder and mental retardation\x92.15 A few years later MacMahon and Sawa in one of several large reviews of this area,16 talked of the \x91voluminous\x92 literature on \x91prenatal influences in mental disease\x92. In the concluding paragraph of their review it is intriguing that they appear to anticipate the more recent interest in the later consequences of fetal growth: \x91The possibility that functional disorders may be related to ... birth weight are facts that have a theoretical significance far deeper than that which is immediately apparent.\x92\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s researchers in the UK and the US were particularly active in working on the aetiology of \x91mental retardation\x92. Indeed David Barker himself published work on the fetal and obstetric antecedents of intelligence,17 funded in part by the America Association for the Aid to the Crippled Child. This organization also funded one of the largest population based surveys of \x91mental retardation\x92 conducted anywhere. The 1962 Aberdeen Reading Survey administered standard psychometric tests to 14 000 primary school children and linked them to details concerning their births and other earlier childhood factors.18 One of the central concerns of this study was to disentangle the effects of fetal and postnatal socio-economic factors. It concluded that the risk of \x91mental retardation\x92 (excluding children with IQ < 50) was related to \x91an interaction of social-environmental circumstances, familial factors and ill-defined features of reproductive inadequacy\x92. This in many respects is a \x91life-course\x92 perspective which acknowledges the complex interplay between biological and social factors played out from conception to adulthood.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeen cohort is currently being revived as a platform for investigating fetal and postnatal influences with a primary focus on adult and physician health and disease. In a similar way, the initial interest in the consequences of maternal malnutrition on the intelligence of offspring that drove the early work on the Dutch Hunger winter has now given way to studies that look at the effect of in utero exposure to famine on cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Addressing the current debate about the role of maternal nutrition in the programming of adult disease, it is salutary to recall that the initial research on prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine failed to find any evidence of an effect on mental performance at age 19 years.19\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth observing that the current interest in the fetal programming of adult disease shares a key theme with the older tradition: the sensitivity of the developing brain in utero. Whereas the earlier work on mental disorders sought to find evidence of the brain's vulnerability to in utero insults, one view on the programming of cardiovascular disease is that it is the consequence of fetal adaptations to impaired nutrition that are made in order to protect the developing brain.20 Efforts to integrate the emerging evidence that fetal growth impairment may affect mental disorders and cognition21 with the \x91brain-sparing\x92 explanation for the fetal programming of cardiovascular disease are likely to be highly informative.""",3
"b""The acceptability of computerized assessment of alcohol habits was explored in 57 consecutive out-patients over a 6-month period. Altogether, 46 men and 11 women agreed to complete a paper and pencil questionnaire exploring their opinion about computerized assessment. The study focused on the patients' acceptance of computerized testing and also on whether some sub-groups had reservations. The participants indicated that they had no general anxiety towards computers and did not mind being assessed by their use. Nearly half of the men were not convinced of the usefulness of computers as a means of asking about alcohol habits. The same level of confidence was recorded with regard to whether doctors would make better assessments using computers. Around one-quarter of both men and women were worried that computers might cause doctors to spend less time with the patients and that staff might lose the personal contact with patients. Because of the small sample size, we conclude tentatively that a computerized lifestyle test appears to be an acceptable method both to men and women with different educational backgrounds. However, two important issues need to be further addressed, namely concerns about confidentiality and loss of personal contact.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Several hundred molecules of enzyme reaction products were detected in a single spheroplast from yeast cells incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) labeled triglucoside, [alpha]-d-Glc(1->2)[alpha]-d-Glc(1->3)[alpha]-d-Glc-O(CH2)8CONHCH2-CH2NH-COTMR. Product detection was accomplished using capillary electrophoresis and laser induced fluorescence following the introduction of a single spheroplast into the separation capillary. The in vivo enzymatic hydrolysis of the TMR-trisaccharide involves at least two enzymes, limited by processing [alpha]-glucosidase I, producing TMR-disaccharide, TMR-monosaccharide, and the free TMR-linking arm. Hydrolysis was reduced by preincubation of the cells with the processing enzyme inhibitor castanospermine.

"b'The present study was performed to assess the effect of short-term ethanol administration on cadmium retention and accumulation as well as on bioelement metabolism (zinc, copper, calcium, and magnesium) in rats exposed to an aqueous solution of cadmium chloride for 8 weeks. Intoxication with cadmium led to accumulation of this toxic metal, particularly in the liver and kidney, which was linked to metallothionein synthesis as well as to a disturbance in the metabolism of zinc, copper, and calcium. These effects were dependent on the level of exposure. The administration of ethanol in the final phase of cadmium treatment increased cadmium retention and accumulation in the body with simultaneous elevation in liver and kidney metallothionein concentration. Ethanol alone or with cadmium caused or intensified the cadmium-induced changes in metabolism of zinc and copper. Calcium metabolism disturbed by cadmium was not influenced by ethanol. Neither agents had any effect on magnesium metabolism. We conclude that even short-term ethanol consumption in conditions of exposure to cadmium can increase this heavy metal body burden and lead to more serious disturbances in metabolism of important elements such as zinc and copper. Cadmium- and ethanol-induced changes in the homeostasis of these microelements are probably connected with the ability of both xenobiotics to cause metallothionein induction.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Background Many epidemiological studies have assessed the relationships between anthropometric variables and breast cancer risk. However, methodological approaches for analysing these factors differ appreciably. Also, age when maximum height is achieved has been identified as a potential risk factor for breast cancer in premenopausal women, but this issue has not been studied in postmenopausal women.\r\n\r\nMethods The participants in this population-based case-control study were postmenopausal women 50\x9664 years of age from the general female population of western Washington State. It included 479 women with incident primary breast cancer and 435 controls.\r\n\r\nResults This study found that: (i) women who gained over 70 pounds since age 18 had an increased risk of breast cancer relative to those who stayed within 10 pounds of their weight at age 18 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95% CI : 1.5\x964.9), (ii) women with body mass indices (BMI) below what is considered healthy had a decreased risk (OR = 0.4; 95% CI : 0.2\x961.1) while women with a BMI in the obese range had an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.4; 95% CI : 1.0\x962.1), and (iii) women who reached their maximum height at or after the age of 18 had a decreased risk of breast cancer compared to women who reached their maximum height at age 13 or younger (OR = 0.7; 95% CI : 0.5\x961.0).\r\n\r\nConclusions By examining various anthropometric variables using clinically relevant strata, a clearer picture of how these variables relate to postmenopausal breast cancer risk was developed.

"b'Background Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) appears to be the primary aetiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). To study the distribution of HHV8, a seroepidemiological study was carried out in western Sicily, where a high incidence rate of classical KS is well documented.\r\n\r\nMethods A total of 970 sera of healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative individuals of general population (1\x9670 years old) and 742 sera of individuals in different risk groups for HIV infection were evaluated by means of an indirect immunofluorescence assay able to detect antibodies to lytic and latent HHV8 antigens.\r\n\r\nResults Crude seroprevalence to HHV8 antigens was 11.5% in the general population, and it increased significantly with age from 6% under age 16 to 22% after age 50. Significantly higher HHV8 seroprevalence rates were detected among HIV positive and negative homosexual men (62% and 22%, respectively), men who had sex with prostitutes (40% and 29%, respectively); female prostitutes (42% and 30%, respectively), and clients at a sexually transmitted disease clinic (male: 60% and 33%, respectively, female: 63% and 43%, respectively). In contrast, heterosexual intravenous drug users had seroprevalence rates comparable to those found in the general population.\r\n\r\nConclusions The results suggest that HHV8 infection is widespread in Western Sicily. The high seroprevalence in individuals with high risk sexual activity point to the role of sexual behaviour in the transmission of the infection in adults, whereas the detection of antibodies in younger population (under 16 years old) is suggestive of a non-sexual route of transmission, probably occurring during childhood by close personal contact.'",3
"b'Truncated forms of cytokine receptors have been regarded as modulators of the activity of their cognate ligands. In addition to inhibiting effects of their respective ligands, soluble receptors can also facilitate ligand-mediated signaling. Several studies have demonstrated that exogenous IL-6 in association with the soluble IL-6 receptor {alpha} (sIL-6R{alpha}) can activate cells expressing the gp130 signal transducer lacking the specific, membrane-bound IL-6R{alpha}. Since cell cultures of human dermal fibroblasts express high amounts of IL-6, we examined whether the addition of sIL-6R{alpha} in association with endogenous IL-6 would be sufficient to stimulate these cells via gp130. As an early rapid signal we analyzed changes in intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i). Addition of sIL-6R{alpha} induced an acute and transient increase in cytosolic free calcium concentrations in a dose-dependent fashion. This Ca2+-signal was abolished when cells were pretreated with anti-IL-6 or anti-gp130 antibodies. Using flow cytometric analysis we could demonstrate membrane-associated IL-6 and gp130, but not IL-6R{alpha} on fibroblasts. We also analyzed MCP-1 and IL-8 expression as a response involved in the more recently recognized chemoattractant functions of fibroblasts, and found MCP-1 to be up-regulated, but not IL-8. These data suggest that sIL-6R{alpha} binds to cell-associated, endogenous IL-6 produced by fibroblasts and this complex then activates the cells via gp130. This pathway of fibroblast activation by sIL-6R{alpha} adds another dimension to the role of fibroblasts in the cytokine network.'",4
"b'Chitobiase is a lysosomal glycosidase that acts during the ordered degradation of asparagine-linked glycoproteins to cleave the core chitobiose unit at its reducing end. Human chitobiase is expressed in significant amounts, while bovine chitobiase is produced at extremely low levels. To begin to understand this species-dependent expression, we determined the gene structure of human chitobiase. The human chitobiase gene (CTBS) is approximately 20 kb comprising seven exons varying from 0.1 to 2.3 kb and six introns of 0.3 to 8 kb. The previously characterized partial bovine chitobiase gene structure is similarly organized including exon and intron sizes and locations, but the human and bovine 5[prime]-flanking regions differ significantly. 5[prime]-RACE analysis of human chitobiase cDNA revealed only one transcriptional start site 45 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation site. Computer analysis of the human chitobiase gene 5[prime]-flanking region shows characteristics of a typical housekeeping gene. The putative promoter region contains a distal TATA box, and there are several Sp-1 and AP-2 cis elements. In contrast, bovine chitobiase gene 5[prime]-flanking region shows totally different structures and may contain several silencers. A partial art-2 segment which is an artiodactyl Alu-like repetitive sequence, is also present. These evolutionary differences in the 5[prime]-flanking region of the chitobiase genes from human and bovine could account for the widely varied expression levels of the hydrolase within these two species.'",2
"b""Mice deficient in MHC class II expression (C2d mice) do not make antibody to protein antigens administered systemically, but their ability to produce IgA antibody to antigen administered at mucosal sites has not been described. We investigated IgA production by C2d mice and their IgA antibody response to antigen given orally. Young C2d mice had normal amounts of serum IgA, intestinal-secreted IgA and normal numbers of intestinal IgA plasma cells, compared to control C57BL/6 mice. IgA production by C2d mice increased with age. Following oral immunization with cholera toxin, C57BL/6 mice responded with IgA and IgG antibody, and had increased numbers of IgA plasma cells, but C2d mice gave no response. The Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node tissues of C2d mice contained very few CD4-expressing T cells. Thus, C2d mice have no typical mucosal CD4 Th cells and cannot respond to a strong oral immunogen, yet they still produced and secreted IgA. We hypothesized that B-1 lymphocytes could provide a source of IgA independent of antigen-specific T cell help. Young C2d mice had normal numbers of peritoneal B-1a cells and their frequency increased with age. To test the role of these B-1a cells, we bred C2d mice to obtain mice that had no MHC class II expression and expressed the Xid gene that confers deficiency in B-1a cells. These double-deficient mice had 10-fold less serum and secreted IgA than all other F2 littermates. We conclude that B-1a cells are essential for the majority of IgA production in C2d mice. Thus, the C2d mouse may provide a useful tool for analysis of the role of intestinal IgA provided by B-1a cells.""",4
"b'Instrumental-variable (IV) methods were invented over 70 years ago, but remain uncommon in epidemiology. Over the past decade or so, non-parametric versions of IV methods have appeared that connect IV methods to causal and measurement-error models important in epidemiological applications. This paper provides an introduction to those developments, illustrated by an application of IV methods to non-parametric adjustment for non-compliance in randomized trials.\r\nMethods for control of confounding and measurement error are central to non-experimental research. One large class of such methods based on instrumental variables (IV) dates back to the 1920s. They have been an integral part of econometrics for decades1,2 and have appeared in the health sciences,3\x965 yet they remain little known in epidemiology. Their absence from the field may in part be due to the fact that the methods were rarely presented outside of linear-regression contexts until the 1980s. The past two decades have seen extensions of IV methods to non-parametric causal models and to non-linear regression.4\x9616 I here provide an elementary introduction to non-parametric IV methods, with a focus on showing how IV assumptions lead to corrections for confounding by non-compliance in randomized trials. This application is especially important because treatment assignment can provide a perfect instrumental variable for confounding control, and IV methods provide an alternative to intent-to-treat analysis. I will also briefly sketch how IV methods for misclassification correction are related to confounding control.\r\n\r\nAn intuitive basis for the methods discussed here is as follows: Suppose X and Y are the exposure and outcome of interest, and we can observe their relation to a third variable Z, called an instrumental variable or instrument, that is associated with X but not associated with Y except through its association with X. Then, under certain conditions, we can write the Z-Y association as a product of the Z-X and X-Y associations, \r\n\r\n\r\nand solve this equation for the X-Y association. This equation is of particular use when either (i) the observed X-Y association is confounded by unmeasured covariates, but the Z-X and Z-Y associations are not confounded; or (ii) the X-Y association cannot be observed directly because we cannot observe X directly, but Z is an observed surrogate for X whose association with X is known or estimable, and whose deviation from X is independent of other variables or errors. The precise conditions under which the equation holds vary with the problem, as will be discussed below.\r\n\r\n'",3
"b'We have now produced mouse\x96human chimeric IgG1 in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines Pro-5 as well as in the glycosylation mutants Lec 2, Lec 8, and Lec 1. Analysis of the attached carbohydrates shows those present on IgG1-Lec 1 were mannose terminated. Carbohydrate present on IgG1-Lec8 was uniformly biantennary terminating in N-acetylglucosamine. The glycosylation profiles of IgG1-Lec 2 and IgG1-Pro-5 were heterogeneous. Only IgG1-Pro-5 was sialylated with sialic acid present on only a small percentage of the carbohydrate structures. When the in vivo fate of antibodies labeled with 125I-lactotyramine was determined, it was found that the majority of all of the antibodies, irrespective of the structure of their attached carbohydrate, is catabolized in the skin and muscle. However, the attached carbohydrate structure does influence the amount that is catabolized in the liver and the liver serves as a major site for the catabolism of proteins bearing carbohydrate with the Lec2 (with terminal galactose) or Lec1(with terminal mannose) structure.'",2
"b'Background In all, 70 municipal incinerators, 307 hospital incinerators and 460 toxic-waste landfill sites in Great Britain were examined for evidence of effluents causing childhood cancers. Municipal incinerators had previously shown significant excesses of adult cancers within 7.5 and 3.0 km. The relative risks for adults had been marginal and an analysis of childhood cancers seemed to offer a more sensitive approach.\r\n\r\nMethods A newly developed technique of analysis compares distances from suspect sources to the birth addresses and to the death addresses of cancer-children who had moved house. A localized hazard, effective at only one of these times, must be preferentially associated with the corresponding address. This creates an asymmetry of migrations towards or away from age-restricted effective sources.\r\n\r\nResults The child-cancer/leukaemia data showed no systematic migration-asymmetries around toxic-waste landfill sites; but showed highly significant excesses of migrations away from birthplaces close to municipal incinerators. Relative risks within 5.0 km of these sites were about 2:1. Hospital incinerators gave analogous results. The ratios greatly exceed findings around \x91non-combustion\x92 urban sites.\r\n\r\nConclusions Because of their locations, the specific effects of the municipal incinerators could not be separated clearly from those of adjacent industrial sources of combustion-effluents. Both were probably carcinogenic. Landfill waste sites showed no such effect.'",3
"b'Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a superantigen causing lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Glucocorticoids are immunosuppressants and are released immediately following SEB intoxication in mice. Whether glucocorticoids affect lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis in SEB-intoxicated mice is still unknown. To study this question, we examined the effects of dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, on SEB-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from mouse thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues (PLT). SEB, as well as concanavalin A (Con A), induced lymphocyte proliferation which peaked on day 4 and declined significantly on day 7. As expected, in Con A-stimulated cultures, DEX completely suppressed the proliferation of lymphocytes from both the thymus and PLT. However, in SEB-stimulated cultures, while DEX completely suppressed thymocyte proliferation, it did not suppress PLT cell proliferation even at a high concentration of 10\x967 M. The proliferating cells were V\xdf8+ T cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. DEX caused apoptosis. SEB also caused apoptosis, which was manifested by a maximal DNA subdiploidy on day 4 and by a maximal DNA fragmentation on day 7. Both events appeared not to be affected by DEX. The failure of DEX to affect the proliferation and apoptosis was consistent with high levels of cytokines (IL-1{alpha}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IFN-{gamma}) produced in the SEB-stimulated cultures, suggesting that the cytokines act in concert to circumvent the effects of DEX.'",4
"b'Background Previous findings suggest that tobacco smoking increases the risk of hip fracture in women. A similar adverse effect of smoking is suspected to be present in men, but bone mineral density studies have raised the concern that men may be more sensitive to the deleterious effect of smoking on bone than women. In this study we prospectively determined the influence of current, previous, and cumulative smoking history on risk of hip fracture in men and women and addressed the issue of possible gender difference in the susceptibility to tobacco smoking.\r\n\r\nMethods Pooled data from three population studies conducted in Copenhagen with detailed information on smoking habit. A total of 13 393 women and 17 379 men, initially examined between 1964 and 1992, were followed until 1997 for first admission due to hip fracture. The relative risks (RR) of hip fracture associated with smoking were estimated by means of multiplicative Poisson regression models.\r\n\r\nResults During follow-up, 722 hip fractures were identified in women, and 447 in men. After adjustment for potential confounders, including body mass index, female current smokers had an RR of hip fracture of 1.36 (95% CI : 1.12\x961.65) and male smokers 1.59 (95% CI : 1.04\x962.43) relative to never smokers. In both sexes, the RR of hip fracture gradually increased by current and accumulated tobacco consumption. The RR were consistently higher in men than in women, but the test for interaction between sex and tobacco smoking was insignificant. After 5 years, male ex-smokers had an adjusted RR of 0.73 (95% CI : 0.55\x960.98) relative to current smokers, while no significant decrease in risk was observed in female ex-smokers (RR = 0.91; 95% CI : 0.72\x961.17)). Approximately 19% of all hip fractures in the present study population were attributable to tobacco smoking.\r\n\r\nConclusion Tobacco smoking is an independent risk factor for hip fracture in men and women, and there appears to be no gender differences in smoking related risk. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of hip fracture in men after 5 years, while the deleterious effect of smoking seems to be more long-lasting in female ex-smokers.'",3
"b'The transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 regulates the activity of src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and thereby influences the signaling via such receptors as T and B cell antigen receptors associated with these PTK. However, its implication in signaling through the mast cell receptor with high affinity for IgE (Fc{epsilon}RI) is less clear, although Lyn, a member of the src family, plays an important role in Fc{epsilon}RI-mediated signaling. To define a role for CD45 in Fc{epsilon}RI signal transduction, we established CD45 high expressing rat basophilic leukemia cell lines (RBL-CD45H) and cell lines expressing trace amounts of CD45 (RBL-CD45L). We demonstrate that although all RBL-CD45L cell lines degranulate following IgE- and antigen-induced Fc{epsilon}RI aggregation, the response is significantly reduced at a low dose of antigen. The cells show a delayed and slowed Ca2+ mobilization even though at a higher dose where the cells degranulate to a similar extent as RBL-CD45H. This diminished Ca2+ response is restored by reconstitution of RBL-CD45L with a chimeric molecule containing the cytoplasmic phosphatase domains of rat CD45. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc{epsilon}RI, association of Fc{epsilon}RI with Lyn and PTK activity associated with Fc{epsilon}RI, all of which are enhanced upon Fc{epsilon}RI aggregation in RBL-CD45H, are impaired in RBL-CD45L. Finally, we show that Fc{epsilon}RI is physically associated with CD45 in RBL-CD45H prior to receptor aggregation. Thus, we propose that, although not indispensable in mast cell degranulation, CD45 positively regulates the signaling through Fc{epsilon}RI by promoting the activation of Fc{epsilon}RI-associated Lyn.'",4
"b'Cancer mortality is increasing while the mortality rates of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebro-vascular disease (CVD) are decreasing, so it is natural to speculate that the increase in cancer mortality may partly be explained by new cancer cases among those avoiding or surviving IHD and CVD. Llorca and Delgado-Rodr\xedguez present an approach based on Markov chains to evaluate this question of competing risks.1 The statistical theory behind the use of Markov chains in the analyses of competing risks is well described2 (textbox). The merit of their paper is therefore to illustrate that the different approaches previously used on this subject in the epidemiological literature can be unified. They analyse the secular trend of cancer mortality from 1981 to 1994 in Spain in the context of competing risks from IHD and CVD using both an \x91elimination model\x922 (\x91What would have happened if IHD and/or CVD had been eradicated\x92) and a \x91constant model\x923 (\x91What would have happened if the mortality of IHD and/or CVD had remained constant\x92). Under both of these scenarios, the estimated lifetime risks of cancer are very much the same as observed in 1994. Based on these findings it is tempting to conclude that the secular trends of IHD and CVD have had little influence on the secular trends of cancer mortality from 1981 to 1994.\r\nIt might seem puzzling that one has to perform a simulation of different hypothetical scenarios in the evaluation of the past. If the question was whether an increase in cancer mortality from 1981 to 1994 was due to an increase in smoking, say, this could\x97in a cohort with smoking information\x97be evaluated by examining the secular trend among non-smokers only. However, the constant model can be viewed in the same way as an \x91everything-else-equal\x92 comparison (i.e. within the stratum of people where new survivors due to decrease in IHD and CVD since 1981 are excluded). In 1981 this stratum is just the total population, in 1994 this is estimated using the higher mortality rates of 1981. If cancer mortality is increasing even in this stratum, then it is unlikely that competing risks are the cause, because in this stratum the competing risk effect is constant. In other words, evaluating historical secular trends in the context of competing risks, as in the paper by Llorca and Delgado-Rodr\xedguez, does not have to be interpreted using different hypothetical scenarios, nor does one model have to be judged as more unrealistic than others. When evaluating past secular trends the most attractive model is the constant model because it gives an \x91everything-else-equal\x92 comparison based on external information. The flexible continuum of models presented by the authors is, in this situation, of little use.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when the question is about secular trends in the future, the realism and multitude of models are important considerations and the framework described by Llorca and Delgado-Rodr\xedguez is well suited for this purpose with the elimination model as the chief example. Another model mentioned in the epidemiological literature which could also be included in this framework is the cause-delay model.4 In the cause-delay model one assumes that each generation approaches the age-specific force of mortality from IHD and CVD later than observed currently, e.g. the current mortality-specific rate for people aged 50\x9654 years, say, is applied in the future scenario for people aged 55\x9659 years.\r\n\r\nA crucial assumption in these analyses is that one can estimate the cancer mortality among survivors using the general age-specific cancer mortality, i.e. the assumption of \x91independent competing risks\x92.5 If the assumption is not fulfilled then it will often induce an overestimation of the beneficial effect of decreasing competing risks because of an underestimation of the mortality rate among the survivors. This would be the case if there is an ascertainment bias that has made some people more prone to have a specific cause notified on their death certificate. Therefore one should always interpret the results as the most optimistic estimate. The assumption of \x91independent competing risks\x92 cannot be evaluated from the data essentially because one cannot identify those avoiding IHD and CVD. If it was possible to identify the people that would have developed IHD and CVD, had it not been eradicated, say, one could compare the cancer mortality in this group with the rest, and thereby check the assumption that the age-specific cancer mortality is the same in these two groups. This is the classical non-identifiability aspect of competing risks.5\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the assumption of \x91independent competing risks\x92 implies that the age-specific cancer mortality (hazard) rates remain the same during the study period. In other words, a person has the same day-to-day risk of dying from cancer irrespective of competing risks, but only the lifetime cancer risk and the expected life length will be affected by competing risks. Therefore when the authors observe that the 5-year mortality rates are higher when IHD and CVD are eliminated, one has to bear in mind that the difference does not reflect that the age-specific cancer mortality (hazard) rate would be higher if IHD and CVD were eliminated. Rather the difference reflects residual confounding in the sense that if IHD and CVD were eliminated, women would on average get older and as cancer mortality generally increases with age one would observe a relatively higher average mortality rate within a 5-year age group. The use of the word \x91rate\x92 in this context is therefore misleading and only life expectancy and probability of death from cancer should be presented. A more satisfactory approach would be to use continuous time Markov processes6 (textbox). In order to apply the discrete time Markov chain the authors have to categorize the time variable (i.e. age) and use the average \x91transition\x92 rate for each age group to calculate the transition probability. The misinterpretation, described above, occurs because the average transition rate cannot be interpreted as a transition rate due to the confounding by age. In a continuous time Markov process the age-specific hazard rates (i.e. the transition rates) are a generic part of the model and therefore the model does not create the illusion that the age-specific rates are changed under different regimes when assuming independent competing risks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the use of Markov chains, as presented by Llorca and Delgado-Rodr\xedguez, is a flexible framework in the evaluation of competing risks. Using continuous time Markov processes would, however, be an even more direct approach. Furthermore it is important to recall that results should always be interpreted with due attention to the underlying unverifiable assumption of \x91independent competing risks\x92.'",3
"b'We have established transgenic mice that carry the genes coding for heavy and light chains of TNP-specific IgE. They produced high titers of TNP-specific IgE (20\x9640 \xb5g/ml in serum) and their mast cells were heavily loaded with IgE. The level of Fc{epsilon}RI expression on their mast cells was 6\x968 times higher than that in non-transgenic littermates. The expression of low-affinity IgE receptor Fc{epsilon}RII (CD23) on splenic B cells was also 6\x968 times higher in the transgenic mice. Consistent with this, substantial amounts of IgE were detected on B cells in the transgenic mice. When challenged with i.v. administration of the corresponding antigen, the transgenic mice exhibited systemic anaphylactic symptoms such as a drastic drop of body temperature and extravasation of administered dye. Biphasic (immediate and delayed) ear swelling response was also elicited in a TNP-specific manner by epicutaneous antigen challenge without any prior sensitization. Thus, IgE produced in the transgenic mice was found to be biologically active to induce both local and systemic allergic reactions in vivo upon the challenge of the corresponding antigen. Taken together, the antigen-specific IgE transgenic mice established for the first time in this study appear to provide an attractive model system to study the pathological roles of IgE in acute and chronic phases of allergic inflammation as well as their immunobiological roles in vivo. They may also be useful to develop novel therapeutic strategies for atopic disorders.'",4
"b'The fine structural motifs of sialic acids, a frequent terminal monosaccharide of glycans, seem to contain essential biological properties. To identify such subtle structural differences, a reliable method was developed for the qualitative and quantitative identification of sialic acids present in different tissues and fluids. This method involved, after liberation of sialic acids by mild acid hydrolysis, their methyl esterification using diazomethane in the presence of methanol and the formation of volatile derivatives using heptafluorobutyric anhydride. The derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode. This technique allowed the separation and identification of a large variety of sialic acids, including different O-acylated forms of N-acetyl and N-glycolyl neuraminic acids and of 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid (Kdn). This method allowed also identifying 8-O-methylated and 8-O-sulfated derivatives, de-N-acetylated neuraminic acid, and 1,7-sialic acid lactones. Compounds present in very complex mixtures could be identified through their fragmentation patterns. Because of the stability of the heptafluorobutyrate derivatives, this method presents important improvements compared to the previous techniques, because it can be frequently applied on very small amounts of crude samples. This methodology will support progress in the field of the biology of sialic acids.'",2
"b'Of all areas studied in the accompanying study, attention effects were most consistent and well resolved in V4. In this study, to define some of the anatomical circuits and neural processes underlying the influence of attention, we examined the laminar distribution and physiology of attention effects in V4 and in two lower areas, V1 and V2. Laminar event-related potential (ERP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles allowed identification of processes occurring in the local ensembles, as well as their sequence and laminar distribution. These methods also permitted us to analyze the brain processes reflected in attention-sensitive components of the surface ERP. As outlined in the previous study, the first robust modulation by attention occurred in V4 during the 100\x96300 ms poststimulus interval. This is the time frame of the net refractoriness which follows the net local excitatory response to luminance increment. Over this interval, attention reduced CSD amplitudes and increased action potential firing rates, findings consistent with disinhibition as a mechanism for attention in V4. Similar effects were observed during the 100\x96300 ms time frame in V2. In V4, attention had no effect on the initial excitatory response at the depth of lamina 4, but it did produce large modulations in supragranular and deep laminae, origins of both feedforward and feedback projections. Attentional modulation in V2 was later than in V4 and concentrated in extragranular laminae, with no modulation of the initial layer 4 response. Attentional modulation in V1 was smaller and still later than that in V2 and was focused in the supragranular laminae. In this paradigm, attention did not modulate either the response in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the initial excitation in lamina 4C of V1. The timing of effects across areas and the laminar distribution of effects within areas indicate that attention effects are mediated by feedback projections. Moreover, our findings suggest that attention may increase the perceptual salience of stimuli by reducing stimulus-evoked refractoriness and/or inhibition in cortical ensembles. Finally, attentional modulation of transmembrane current flow in V4 produced a sustained negative deflection in the laminar ERP profile, that was manifested in the ERP over the occipital surface. This posits a mechanism for the \x91selection negativity\x92, a scalp ERP effect noted under similar experimental conditions in human subjects.'",1
"b""Background Research into reproductive health is dependent on participants accurately reporting sensitive behaviours. We examined whether audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI), which increased sensitive behaviour reporting in the US, is a feasible method of surveying in developing countries.\r\n\r\nMethods Zimbabwean women in three educational groups were surveyed about demographics and family planning using interviewer and ACASI modes. An exit survey was administered to elicit information about the participants' opinions and experiences using ACASI.\r\n\r\nResults The majority of women (86%) preferred ACASI to interviewer mode. The reasons mentioned were always related to increased confidentiality and privacy. Ability to use ACASI and user preferences varied with educational level. More women with primary school or less education (53%) reported problems with computer use than women in the higher educational groups (10\x9612%). The percentage of women having perfect response concordance between ACASI and interviewer modes increased significantly with education (64%, 81%, and 84% respectively; Ptrend < 0.001).\r\n\r\nConclusions Use of ACASI may be more feasible in Zimbabwe and other developing countries than was originally thought, but ACASI programs should continue to be improved and tested in various countries and population groups.""",3
"b'Highly microheterogeneous polyglycosylceramides (PGCs) of human erythrocytes with an average composition of about 25 monosaccharides linked to ceramide were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori was earlier shown to bind this glycosphingolipid mixture by thin-layer chromatogram binding assay. The receptor activity was present along the whole nonresolved chromatographic interval. Mass spectra of intact PGCs were compared with corresponding spectra of oligosaccharides enzymatically released from the ceramides. Two subfractions of PGCs containing less than one and more than one sialic acid residue per molecule were used. MALDI-MS spectra were recorded in both linear and reflectron mode with the accuracies of [le]0.08% and [le]0.02%, respectively, which allowed determination of the constituent parts of the detected ions in form of ceramide and number of hexoses, N-acetylhexosamines, fucoses and sialic acids. Molecular species were found based on ceramide with mainly sphingosine and fatty acids 24:0 and 24:1 (with less amounts of 22:0), and with a total number of monosaccharides ranging from 11 (neutral, m/z = 2605 for [M+Na]+) to 41 (one sialic acid, m/z = 8057 for [M-H]-). The saccharide composition obtained supported a successively extended and branched N-acetyllactosamine core with substitutions of fucoses (0 up to 8) and sialic acid (0 to 1). The reliable molecular analysis of large oligosaccharides linked to ceramide using this approach will be of great help for the further structure analysis in order to define the epitope for the sialic acid-dependent binding by the bacterium.'",2
"b'The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is the standard task paradigm to detect human frontal lobe dysfunction. In this test, subjects sort card stimuli with respect to one of three possible dimensions (color, form and number). These dimensions are changed intermittently, whereupon subjects are required to identify by trial and error a new correct dimension and flexibly shift cognitive set. We decomposed the cognitive requirements at the time of the dimensional changes of the WCST, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By explicitly informing subjects of a new correct dimension, the working memory load for the trial-and-error identification of the new dimension was removed. Event-related fMRI still revealed transient activation time-locked to the dimensional changes in areas in the posterior part of the inferior frontal sulci. However, the activation was significantly smaller than in the original WCST in which subjects had to use working memory to identify the new dimension by trial and error. Furthermore, these areas were found to spatially overlap the areas activated by a working memory task. These results suggest that working memory and set-shifting act cooperatively in the same areas of prefrontal cortex to adapt us to changing environments.'",1
"b'The laminar pattern of axonal termination from prefrontal (caudal orbitofrontal, rostral orbitofrontal and lateral areas) to anterior temporal areas (entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex and area TE) and from temporal to prefrontal areas was investigated with the aid of anterograde tracers. Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices. A robust projection from dysgranular orbitofrontal areas terminated in the deep layers of the agranular entorhinal cortex. Projections from prefrontal areas to area TE terminated in the upper layers, and may facilitate focused attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli processed through reciprocal pathways between prefrontal and temporal cortices.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'It is now widely accepted that the risks of a number of chronic diseases in adulthood may have their origins before birth. Such diseases include non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Professor David Barker and colleagues in Southampton have produced a large proportion of the data in this field over the last decade,1 although the relationship between early life events and adult disease had been raised many years earlier.2 Most of this work has been based on epidemiological studies wherein cohorts of subjects whose birth records were available have been traced into adulthood. They have shown that measurements made on babies at birth, including birthweight, length, body proportions and placental weight, are strongly related to either later disease incidence (coronary heart disease mortality, non-insulin-dependent diabetes)3,4 or risk factors for those diseases (hypertension, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidaemia).1,5,6 Such relationships have been shown to hold in many different populations and are apparent from early childhood.7,8\r\n\r\nThe basis of these epidemiological observations is proposed to be that of programming. That is, an event operating at a critical or sensitive period results in a long-term change in the structure or function of the organism. Programming is a well-established biological phenomenon, and there are many common and well-known examples. Female rats given testosterone during the first 4 days of life develop a male pattern of gonatotropin secretion after puberty, and despite normal ovarian and pituitary function, fail to develop normal patterns of female sexual behaviour.9 Administration of androgen at 10 days of age has no such effect. Similarly, transient immunization of neonatal rats against growth hormone releasing factor results in permanent impairment of pituitary growth hormone secretion and permanent impairment of growth rate.10 Exposure of neonatal rats to short periods of stimulation, handling or various stressors results in permanent changes in hypothalamic structure and systemic responses to stress.11,12 Since most examples of programming involve a critical period early in life, this phenomenon as the proposed basis of the epidemiological observations is both epidemiologically and biologically plausible. Thus a programming stimulus in fetal life is proposed to lead both to changes in size at birth and also to altered homeostatic mechanisms such as regulation of blood pressure or insulin sensitivity, which in turn result in susceptibility to disease in later life.13\r\n\r\nThe question which then arises concerns the nature of the programming stimulus. Undernutrition was proposed early as a likely programming stimulus, although others such as excessive fetal exposure to glucocorticoids have also been proposed.14\x9616 This review will focus on nutrition as the hypothesized primary programming stimulus. It will examine the experimental basis for this hypothesis, a number of assumptions and misconceptions surrounding the hypothesis, and the need for caution in applying the results of animal experiments to the human situation.'",3
"b'Sequestration of neutrophils and release of histotoxic mediators are considered important for the development of pathologic alterations of the lung defined as adult respiratory distress syndrome. Mechanisms of inflammatory lung injury caused by abdominal sepsis were investigated using the colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) model that closely mimics the human disease. In the CASP model, a continuous leakage of intraluminal bacteria into the peritoneal cavity is induced by implantation of a stent in the ascending colon, generating a septic focus. In contrast to the cecal ligation and puncture model of peritonitis, survival of mice following CASP surgery is dependent on IFN-{gamma}, but independent of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Here we show that the systemic inflammation induced by CASP surgery results in a rapid and profound increase of lung vascular permeability that was associated with the activation and recruitment of neutrophils to the lung. Activation of circulating granulocytes was characterized by increased production of serine proteinases and reactive oxygen metabolites, as well as elevated expression of cell surface Mac-1. Expression of MIP-2, KC, MIP-1{alpha} and E-selectin mRNA in lung was strongly increased within 3 h following CASP surgery, whereas up-regulation of IP-10, MCP-1 and P-selectin was delayed. In contrast, induction of RANTES, LIX, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA was weak or not detectable after CASP surgery. Importantly, recruitment of leukocytes to the lung was normal in lipopolysaccharide-resistant mice, and was not affected by antibody neutralization of TNF or the chemokines MIP-2 and KC.'",4
"b'The pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) implies the sequential infection of many cell types from mucosal cells to neurons, each having a unique pattern of protein glycosylation. The HSV-1 glycoprotein gC-1 is highly glycosylated and contains not only N-linked glycans but also a large number of O-linked glycans, some of which are clustered into two pronase-resistant arrays in the vicinity of the HSV-1 receptor-binding domain of gC-1. The aim of the present study was to characterize gC-1 signals for addition of clustered glycans, to determine the efficacy of synthetic peptides, representing putative O-glycosylation signals, as substrates for a panel of GalNAc transferases, and to identify possible effects of early O-linked glycosylation on the biological functions of gC-1. Gel filtration analysis of the pronase-resistant gC-1 O-glycan clusters from a glycoprotein mutant, lacking a site for N-linked glycosylation at Asn 73 in the vicinity of the O-glycosylation signal, suggested that one function of this N-linked glycan was to modulate the access for GalNAc transferases to one particular O-glycosylation peptide signal (aa 80\x96104). The ability of four GalNAc-transferase isoenzymes with different cell type expression patterns to initialize O-glycosylation of synthetic gC-1 derived peptides was analyzed. Two synthetic gC-1 peptides (aa 55\x9669 and aa 80\x96104) were excellent substrates for all four GalNAc-transferases, suggesting that cell types expressing less frequent GalNAc transferase species with unusual acceptor peptide sequence specificities may also produce a highly O-glycosylated gC-1 after HSV-1 infection. The O-linked glycans were not essential for cell surface expression of gC-1, but monoclonal antibody\x96assisted epitope analysis of N-acetylgalactosaminidase\x96treated gC-1 showed that the O-linked monosaccharide GalNAc contributed to expression of a three-dimensional epitope overlapping the heparan sulfate\x96binding domain of gC-1.'",2
"b'Background Increasing prevalence and worldwide variation in asthma and other atopic diseases suggest the influence of environmental factors, at least one possibly related to socioeconomic wellbeing. This paper examines the relationship of symptoms of asthma, rhinitis and eczema with gross national product per capita (GNP per capita).\r\n\r\nMethods The prevalences of atopic symptoms in 6\x967- and 13\x9614-year-old children were assessed in 91 centres (from 38 countries) and 155 centres (from 56 countries), respectively, in the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC). These symptoms were related to 1993 GNP per capita for each country as reported by the World Bank. The relationships between symptoms of atopic diseases and infant mortality, the human development index and 1982 GNP per capita were also considered.\r\n\r\nResults The countries in the lowest quartile of GNP per capita have the lowest median positive responses to all the questions on symptoms of asthma, rhinitis and eczema. There was a statistically significant positive association between wheeze in the last 12 months and GNP per capita in the 13\x9614-year age group, but not in the 6\x967-year age group. There was also a positive association between GNP per capita and eczema in both age groups.\r\n\r\nConclusions The positive associations between GNP per capita and atopic symptoms being of only moderate strength suggests that the environmental factors are not just related to the wealth of the country.'",3
"b'The primary visual cortex (V1) of primates receives visual signals from cells in the koniocellular (K), magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The functional role of the K pathway is unknown, but one proposal is that it modulates visual activity locally via release of nitric oxide (NO). One goal of this study was to examine the distribution of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS), the enzyme that produces NO, using immunocytochemistry for brain NOS (bNOS) or histochemistry for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase activity in the V1 target cells of the K pathway and within the LGN itself. A second goal was to examine bNOS and NADPH diaphorase activity within proposed functional compartments in the second visual area (V2). We examined the LGN, V1 and V2 in squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys and bushbabies. In V1 and V2, we found that dense neuropil staining for NADPH diaphorase mirrored the pattern of high metabolic activity shown with cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining but did not necessarily mirror the pattern of immunolabeling seen with antibodies against NOS. The smooth stellate cells stained for NADPH diaphorase or bNOS were sparse and did not colocalize with LGN recipient zones in V1 or with the CO compartments in V2. LGN cells projecting to V1, including K, M and P cells, were negative for bNOS and NADPH diaphorase. Therefore, high levels of NOS are not limited to the K pathway. Instead, dense NOS activity is present in interneurons and within the neuropil of V1 and V2 that exhibit high metabolic demand.'",1
"b'The truncated catalytic domain of bovine [beta]1,4 galactosyltransferase-1 was expressed as inclusion bodies in E.coli and folded to generate 10-15 mg of active enzyme per liter of bacterial culture after extraction and purification under denaturing conditions. Mutations were introduced to investigate the roles of Trp312, Asp318, and Asp320, components of a highly conserved region of sequence in all known [beta]4GT-1 homologues that includes a cluster of acidic residues. Near and far UV CD spectra of the mutants indicate that the substitutions did not perturb the secondary and tertiary structure of [beta]4GT-1, and steady state kinetic studies indicate only minor effects on the response to an essential metal cofactor. However substitutions for the two aspartyl residues result in a reduction in catalytic efficiency of a magnitude that suggests they are important for catalysis. It seems possible that this anionic center may act in stabilizing a carbocation formed from the galactose component of the donor substrate in the transition state, reflecting a common reaction mechanism for [beta]-galactosyltransferase reactions.'",2
"b""Background Previous studies of diet and coronary heart disease (CHD) have focused on intake of nutrients rather than whole foods. Because of the findings that dietary fibre, folate and antioxidants may be protective for CHD, increased intake of vegetables has been recommended. However, due to the chemical and physical complexity of vegetables, the effects of individual nutrients may differ if eaten as whole foods. Moreover, little is known about the direct association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD.\r\n\r\nMethods We prospectively evaluated the relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized trial of aspirin and beta-carotene among 22 071 US male physicians aged 40\x9684 years in 1982. In this analysis, we included 15 220 men without heart disease, stroke or cancer at baseline who provided information on their vegetable intake at baseline, and in the 2nd, 4th and 6th years of follow-up using a simple semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire including eight vegetables. We confirmed 1148 incident cases of CHD (387 incident cases of myocardial infarction and 761 incident cases of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) during 12 years of follow-up.\r\n\r\nResults After adjusting for age, randomized treatment, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of high cholesterol, and use of multivitamins, men who consumed at least 2.5 servings/day of vegetables had a relative risk (RR) of 0.77 (95% CI : 0.60\x960.98) for CHD, compared with men in the lowest category (<1 serving/day). Adjusting for the same covariates in an analysis of the overall trend that considered intake of vegetables as a continuous variable, we found a RR of 0.83 (95% CI : 0.71\x960.98) for risk of CHD for each additional serving/day of vegetables. The inverse relation between vegetable intake and CHD risk was more evident among men with a BMI >=25 (RR = 0.71, 95% CI : 0.51\x960.99) or current smokers (RR = 0.40, 95% CI : 0.18\x960.86) comparing highest to the lowest categories of intake.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our results suggest an inverse association between vegetable intake and risk of CHD. These prospective data support current dietary guidelines to increase vegetable intake for the prevention of CHD.""",3
"b'Monocytes and neutrophils are chronically recruited to joints in rheumatoid arthritis. In the joints of rats with adjuvant arthritis, this is mediated, in part, by selectin-dependent and selectin-independent mechanisms. To define the selectin-independent mechanisms, 51Cr-labeled blood monocytes, 111In-labeled neutrophils and function blocking mAb to the selectins and integrins were utilized. Integrins contributed to the selectin-independent monocyte migration to arthritic joints with 58\x9670% inhibition of this recruitment by anti-{alpha}4 or anti-LFA-1 mAb, relative to selectin blockade alone. {alpha}4 plus P-selectin blockade was as effective as combined blockade of {alpha}4, P-, E- and L-selectin, mediating ~83% of the overall monocyte migration to the joints. In contrast, LFA-1 was the predominant selectin-independent mechanism for neutrophil recruitment to the joints. LFA-1 together with P-selectin had essential roles in the talar joint. In dermal inflammation in the arthritic rats, LFA-1 accounted for most (69%) of the selectin-independent monocyte migration to the chemoattractant C5adesArg (zymosan-activated serum), whereas LFA-1 and Mac-1 both contributed to selectin-independent neutrophil recruitment to C5adesArg. {alpha}4 integrin and P-selectin in concert mediated monocyte recruitment to lipopolysaccharide and IFN-{gamma} lesions (81%). Thus: (1) either {alpha}4 or LFA-1 can mediate monocyte migration to arthritic joints in the absence of selectin function and {alpha}4 together with P-selectin is particularly important; (2) LFA-1 is the predominant mechanism of selectin-independent migration of neutrophils to inflamed joints; and (3) in arthritic rats, selectin-independent migration of monocytes and neutrophils to dermal inflammation is mediated by {alpha}4 or LFA-1 or both LFA-1 and Mac-1, depending on the leukocyte type, and inflammatory stimulus.'",4
"b'Two cDNAs, M1 and M2, recently isolated by the differential display method from embryonic rat cerebral hemisphere were characterized and their patterns of spatiotemporal expression analysed in developing rat forebrain by in situ hybridization histochemistry and correlative immunocytochemistry. Neither gene bears any sequence homology to other known genes. Both genes are particularly expressed in medial regions of the cerebral hemisphere and M2 in the roof of the adjacent diencephalon. M1 expression is highly localized and confined to the neuroepithelium of the hippocampal rudiment from embryonic day (E) 12 onward. Its location corresponds to the fimbrial anlage, and immunocytochemical localization of M1 protein indicates its expression in radial glial cells. M2 expression at E12 is more extensive in the medial cerebral wall, extending into the preoptic region and beyond the hippocampus into dorsal hemisphere and into the dorsal diencephalon, with caudal extension along the dorsal midline and in the zona limitans intrathalamica. Later, M2 expression is found in association with the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, fimbria, optic nerve, stria medullaris, mamillothalamic tract and habenulopeduncular tract. M1 and M2 expression domains corresponding to the locations of fiber tracts are present prior to the arrival of the earliest axons, as identified by neuron specific markers. These findings suggest M1 and/or M2 genes are involved in early regional specification of the hippocampus and related structures in paramedian regions of the forebrain, and that cell populations expressing these genes in advance of developing axonal pathways may be involved in the early specification of tract location.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The main structural features of bacterial peptidoglycan are linear glycan chains interlinked by short peptides. The glycan chains are composed of alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), all linkages between sugars being \xdf,1->4. On the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, two types of activities are involved in the polymerization of the peptidoglycan monomer unit: glycosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of the linear glycan chains and transpeptidases that catalyze the formation of the peptide cross-bridges. Contrary to the transpeptidation step, for which there is an abundant literature that has been regularly reviewed, the transglycosylation step has been studied to a far lesser extent. The aim of the present review is to summarize and evaluate the molecular and cellullar data concerning the formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Early work concerned the use of various in vivo and in vitro systems for the study of the polymerization steps, the attachment of newly made material to preexisting peptidoglycan, and the mechanism of action of antibiotics. The synthesis of the glycan chains is catalyzed by the N-terminal glycosyltransferase module of class A high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins and by nonpenicillin-binding monofunctional glycosyltransferases. The multiplicity of these activities in a given organism presumably reflects a variety of in vivo functions. The topological localization of the incorporation of nascent peptidoglycan into the cell wall has revealed that bacteria have at least two peptidoglycan-synthesizing systems: one for septation, the other one for elongation or cell wall thickening. Owing to its location on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and its specificity, the transglycosylation step is an interesting target for antibacterials. Glycopeptides and moenomycins are the best studied antibiotics known to interfere with this step. Their mode of action and structure\x96activity relationships have been extensively studied. Attempts to synthesize other specific transglycosylation inhibitors have recently been made.'",2
"b'Schizosaccharomyces pombe synthesizes very large N-linked galactomannans, which are elongated from the Man9GlcNAc2 core that remains after the trimming of three Glc residues from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 originally transferred from dolichyl pyrophosphate to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Prior to elongation of the galactomannan outer chain, the Man9GlcNAc2 core is modified into a family of Hex10-15GlcNAc2 structures by the addition of both Gal and Man residues (Ziegler et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem., 269, 12527-12535). To understand the pathway of Man9GlcNAc2 modification, the Hex10GlcNAc-sized pool was isolated by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration from the endo H-released N-glycans of S.pombe glycoproteins. This pool yielded four major fractions, a, b, c, and g, on preparative high pH, anion exchange chromatography, that represented 10, 29, 46, and 13% of the total Hex10GlcNAc present, respectively. Structures of the glycan isomers present in each fraction were determined by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques. Fraction a is principally (~93%) a Man10GlcNAc with a new [alpha]1,2-linked Man cap on the upper-arm of Man9GlcNAc. Fraction b contained two isomers of GalMan9GlcNAc in which an [alpha]1,2-linked terminal Gal had been added either to the upper (b1, 30%) or middle-arm (b2, 70%) of Man9GlcNAc. The gma12- [alpha]1,2-galactosyltransferase-negative S.pombe strain (Chappell et al. (1994) Mol. Biol. Cell., 5, 519-528) did not make fraction b implying that the gma12p galactosyltransferase is responsible for synthesis of both isomers b1 and b2. Isomer c is Man10GlcNAc in which a new branching [alpha]1,6-linked Man had been added to the lower-arm [alpha]1,3-linked core residue as found earlier in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. Fraction g had less than molar stoichiometry of both Gal and Glc. The major isomer (g1, 85%) is the Man9GlcNAc core with an [alpha]1,3-linked branching Gal on the penultimate 2-O-substituted Man of the lower arm. This residue is also found on a novel O-linked oligosaccharide recently described in S.pombe; Man[alpha]1,2(Gal[alpha]1,3)Man[alpha]1,2Mannitol (Gemmill and Trimble (1999) Glycobiology, 9, 507-515). The second isomer (g2, 15%) is the partially processed Glc2Man9GlcNAc intermediate. Defining these Hex10GlcNAc structures provides a starting point for understanding the enzymology of N-linked galactomannan core heterogeneity seen on S.pombe glycoproteins.'",2
"b'Background In nutritional epidemiology, it is often of interest to disentangle the risk of disease associated with related foods or nutrients, where the food items are in a nested arrangement within a larger group. To compare odds ratios (OR) derived from a standard quantile-based analysis can be misleading since the amounts consumed may differ substantially for different dietary components.\r\n\r\nMethods The authors applied different logistic regression models on a case-control study concerning the risk of colorectal adenomas due to meat and its different subsets such as white meat, red meat and well-done red meat.\r\n\r\nResults By calculating OR for a fixed amount of intake, the authors suggest a method for partitioning the risk of one dietary item into that associated with increasingly detailed sub-components. A graph is presented for illustrating such partitions in terms of both addition and substitution effects.\r\n\r\nConclusions Odds ratios based on upper versus lower quantiles or percentiles are useful as they compare the risk between the upper and lower ends of the consumption range. A complimentary set of OR are those based on fixed amounts of consumption. These allow for direct comparisons between nested subgroups of dietary components, in order to disentangle the risk linked to specific groups of foods or nutrients.'",3
"b'In a model of psychological dependence, a very stable ethanol intake was induced by a chronic (1-year) intermittent (once a week) exposure to intoxicating amounts of ethanol (24 h choice between ethanol and water, followed by 2.0 g/kg i.p.). After this year, the rats had continuous access to ethanol and water. Stability was shown by the ability of the rats to take the same dose of ethanol (in g/kg) when the concentration was changed from 10 to 20%. To study possible priming or inhibiting effects on ethanol intake, ethanol was injected i.p., first as 20%, 40% or 60% of the intake in the 24 h prior to the injection, then as fixed doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg, and the ethanol intake during the following 24-h period was recorded. The results showed that, following a low dose of ethanol, voluntary ethanol intake was increased in rats with a low, and decreased in rats with a high, ethanol intake, while high doses of ethanol seemed to decrease voluntary ethanol intake in all rats. The results are discussed in relation to theories about loss of control of drinking and relapse in humans.'",0
"b'bcl-2 transgenic mice develop anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibodies similar to those present in systemic lupus erythematosus. To begin to understand where a breakdown in the regulation of autoreactive lymphocytes is occurring, we have used a bcl-2 transgene (Tg) in conjunction with an Ig Tg that allows us to identify and track anti-dsDNA B cells. Previously, we have shown that anti-dsDNA B cells are actively tolerized in BALB/c mice as manifested by their developmental arrest, follicular exclusion, increased in vivo turnover rate and lack of their antibody in the serum. The bcl-2 Tg mice increased the lifespan of anti-dsDNA B cells, but did not alter the other features of tolerance, indicating that the anergy of the anti-dsDNA B cells is independent of their reduced lifespan. Furthermore, these data suggest that the serum anti-dsDNA antibodies in bcl-2 transgenic mice are not due to a breakdown in the induction or maintenance of B cell anergy; rather they may originate from B cells that have transited through a germinal center.'",4
"b'O-Linked fucose is an unusual carbohydrate modification in which fucose is linked directly to the hydroxyl groups of serines or threonines. It has been found on the epidermal growth factor-like modules of several secreted proteins involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. We have recently reported the existence of an elongated form of O-linked fucose in Chinese hamster ovary cells consisting of a glucose linked to the 3[prime]-hydroxyl of fucose (Glc[beta]1,3Fuc-O-Ser/Thr). This structure is highly unusual for two reasons. First, in mammalian systems fucose is usually a terminal modification of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. Here the fucose is internal. Secondly, terminal [beta]-linked glucose is extremely rare on mammalian glycoconjugates. Thus, the Glc[beta]1,3Fuc structure is a very unique mammalian carbohydrate structure. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of a novel enzyme activity capable of forming this unique linkage: UDP-glucose: O-linked fucose [beta]1,3 glucosyltransferase. The enzyme utilizes UDP-glucose as the high energy donor and transfers glucose to [alpha]-linked fucose residues. The activity is linearly dependent on time, enzyme, and substrate concentrations and is enhanced in the presence of manganese ions. Activity is present in extracts of cultured cells from a variety of species (hamster, human, mouse, rat, chicken) and is enriched in brain and spleen of a normal adult rat. Thus, while this glycosyltransferase appears to be widespread in biology, it forms a very unique linkage, and it represents the first mammalian enzyme identified capable of elongating fucose.'",2
"b""During the development of lymphocytes, expression of the Ig genes is strictly regulated in a tissue-specific manner and in a time-ordered fashion. We have previously shown that the PU.1 binding motif in the Ig{kappa} 3' enhancer ({kappa}E3') and a novel Ets family protein other than PU.1 may be possibly involved in the control of V{kappa}\x96J{kappa} joining. In the attempt to isolate the novel Ets family protein, we have screened cDNA libraries with the yeast one-hybrid method and identified a new PU.1-related factor, Prf. This novel Ets family protein is shown to interact with the PU.1 binding sequences in various promoters and enhancers, including {kappa}E3'. It was found that expression of the prf gene is predominant in the B-lineage cells, with the exception of immature B cells. Since Prf does not exhibit functions of transcriptional activity, this novel protein may act as an antagonist against other Ets family proteins, e.g. PU.1 and Spi-B. Possible roles of Prf with respect to the B cell differentiation are discussed.""",4
"b'We used positron emission tomography to study cortical regions mediating tactile attention. Cues selectively directed subjects to attend to the roughness or duration of contact with embossed gratings that rubbed against a single fingertip with controlled speed and force. The task required discriminating between paired gratings that differed in tactile features of roughness and/or length. For different blocks of trials, cues directed attention to one tactile feature or indicated a divided attention strategy to a change in either feature. All attention conditions unambiguously activated several somatosensory foci in the parietal cortex, including somatotopically appropriate portions of the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus (S1) and the secondary somatosensory region (S2) within parietal opercular regions. There was no evidence for separate processing foci for selective and divided attention strategies, or for selectively attending to roughness versus stimulus duration. We observed a greater magnitude blood flow change in S2 versus S1 during attention tasks, which suggests that S2 might actually influence S1 activity. Despite these differences, modulation of S1 and S2 supports concepts of early selection in tactile attention. There were also examples of non-sensory foci in frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral superior parietal regions at the fundus of the postcentral sulcus. Posterior parietal regions observed in this study did not overlap foci seen in studies of visual attention. Thus, the posterior parietal region may be subdivided into modality-specific subregions, each of which processes information needed to attend to a specific modality. These non-sensory areas may constitute a network that provides a source of modulating influences on the earlier stage, sensory areas.'",1
"b'Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal cells of various hematopoietic cell lineages deficient in surface expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules. By analyzing T cells isolated from patients affected with PNH, it was found that ex vivo GPI-deficient CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral T cells display a more naive phenotype as compared to wild-type cells. In addition, in vitro proliferative responses to allogeneic antigen-presenting cells were shown to be reduced in mutant T cells. To investigate the molecular basis responsible for defective T cell activation in GPI-deficient T cells, T cell lines and T cell clones were generated from patients affected with PNH. When stimulated with anti-CD3{epsilon} mAb, mutant cells displayed a significantly decreased activation of protein tyrosine kinase p56lck. The decreased kinase activity was accompanied by a delayed TCR capping and internalization. Interestingly, protein tyrosine phosphorylation is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively affected, with one substrate being more intensively phosphorylated in mutant than in wild-type cells. These observations suggest that a defective activation of p56lck contributes to the depressed immune responses observed in GPI-deficient T cells derived from PNH patients.'",4
"b'Background Capture-recapture (CR) methods are increasingly used to estimate the size of human populations, including those with diabetes. Few studies have examined the demographic details needed to match patients on the lists used in these techniques, or to determine the optimum number of lists.\r\n\r\nMethods Six lists of known diabetic patients attending different medical settings during the study year were obtained. The effects on total enumeration after aggregation of these lists were examined using increasing numbers of demographic data items as patient identifiers. The CR estimates of prevalence were obtained using 15 different combinations of two lists. Estimates were obtained after log-linear modelling for interdependence between different combinations of three and four lists, and after combining the six available lists into three logical lists.\r\n\r\nResults For matching patients, adding date of birth to first name and family name as matching criteria increased the total of identified patients from 2500 to 2585 (3% increase), corresponding to a period prevalence of 1.5% (95% CI : 1.41\x961.52). Addition of further identifiers, such as partial postcode, only increased the estimate by a further 15 patients (0.5%), and more detailed matching with full postcode introduced uncertainty. The use of two-list CR yielded widely varying estimates of the total diabetic population from 1379 (95% CI : 435\x962273) to 9554 (95% CI : 7291\x9610 983). Log-linear modelling using different combinations of three and four lists produced estimates of 5074 (95% CI : 4417\x965947) and 5578 (95% CI : 4918\x967081), respectively, after compensating for statistical interdependence between the lists used. The appropriate condensation of six available lists into three lists for modelling yielded estimates of 5492 (95% CI : 4870\x966285), corresponding to a CR-adjusted period prevalence of 3.1% (95% CI : 3.03\x963.19%).\r\n\r\nConclusions In a Western population, the only demographic data required for matching patients on lists used for CR methods are first name, family name and date of birth, if unique identifiers such as social security numbers are not available. Two lists alone do not produce reliable data, and at least three lists are needed to allow for modelling for \x91dependence\x92 between datasets. The use of more than three lists does not substantially alter the absolute value or confidence of enumeration, and multiple lists (if available) should be condensed into three lists for use in CR calculations.'",3
"b""Young people's exposure to alcohol in Britain is a major cause of concern to alcohol workers, yet little impact has been made on the problem despite extensive research and numerous recommendations for tackling it. To some extent, this is due to permissive public attitudes and the general lack of knowledge among the public and professionals of the dangers of alcohol misuse, but lack of leadership by government and targetting of alcohol at the young by the drinks industry must take some of the blame. Particular issues of relevance to young people are excessive drinking in pregnancy, which may affect the fetus, alcoholic parents, drinking among 11\x9615 year olds, and heavy consumption by older adolescents. The pressure that these put on social and health sevices (and the expense) is considerable. Rather than concentrating resources on treating the damage, greater emphasis should be placed on prevention and detection, for example recognizing risk factors \x97 immaturity, poor educational performance, antisocial behaviour, mental heath problems and dysfunctional families \x97 which lead to harm. This will require better education about alcohol for child specialists, teachers, social workers, the police, the legal professions, and others who have to deal with young people. Self-help groups among the young could help spread the message of sensible drinking among their peers. In addition, the number of alcohol agencies in the community which support parents and young people, at present woefully inadequate, need to be increased as a matter of urgency.""",0

"b""We report the characterization of two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that produce large amounts of sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides. Clones 26 and 489 were derived by stable transfection of the glycosaminoglycan-deficient cell mutant pgsA-745 with a cDNA library prepared from wild-type cells. Peptide:N-glycanase F released nearly all of the sulfate label, indicating that sulfation had occurred selectively on the Asn-linked glycans. Hydrazinolysis followed by nitrous acid treatment at pH 4 and borohydride reduction yielded reduced sulfated disaccharides that comigrated with standard Gal3SO4\xdf1-4anhydromannitol. The disaccharides were resistant to periodate oxidation but became sensitive after the sulfate group was removed by methanolysis, indicating that the sulfate was located at C3 of the galactose residues. Maackia amurensis lectin bound to the sulfated glycopeptides on the cell surface and in free form, even after sialidase treatment. This finding indicates that the lectin requires only a charged group at C3 of the galactose unit and not an intact sialic acid. Growth of cells with chlorate restored sialidase sensitivity to lectin binding, indicating that sulfation and sialylation occurred largely at the same sites. The enhanced sulfation was due to elevated sulfotransferase activity that catalyzed transfer of sulfate from phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate to Gal\xdf1-4(3)GlcNAc\xdf-O-naphthalenemethanol.""",2
"b'The secreted acid phosphatase (SAcP) of L.donovani is a heterogeneous glycoprotein that displays a wide array of N- and O-linked glycosylations. The O-linked sugars are of particular interest due to their similarity to the phosphoglycan structures of the major lipophosphoglycan surface antigen and released phosphoglycan (Turco et al., 1987; Greis et al., 1992). This study describes a structural analysis of the SAcP O-linked glycosylations using mass spectroscopy, amino acid sequencing, and enzymatic carbohydrate sequencing. Analysis of glycan chain lengths and peptide glycosylation site distribution was performed, revealing that the average O-linked structure was ~32 repeat units in length. Amino acid sequence analysis of glycosylated peptides showed that phosphoglycosylations did not occur randomly but were localized to specific serine residues within an array of degenerate serine/threonine-rich repeat sequences localized in the C-terminus. No evidence was obtained for modification of threonine residues. The observed pattern suggested that a consensus sequence may exist for localization of phosphoglycan structures.'",2

We wanted to assess if manual work remained a risk factor after adjusting for number of hours worked, income, level of education, gender and marital status, and if the risk associated with manual work was equal in the 1970s and the 1980s.\r\n\r\nMethods In a prospective study, data on all new disability pensioners with osteoarthritis in Norway during the two follow-up periods, 1971\x961980 and 1981\x961990, were analysed by logistic regression. The study include data on all subjects living in Norway and registered as 50\x9656 years old and employed either in the census collected in 1970 or in the census of 1980.\r\n\r\nResults Manual workers have nearly twice the probability of becoming a disability pensioner with osteoarthritis compared to professionals after adjusting for part-time work, income, level of education, marital status and gender. Adjusted for other risk factors, the probability of becoming a disability pensioner with osteoarthritis was three times higher in the 1980s compared to the 1970s.\r\n\r\nConclusion The relatively strong association between manual work and disability pensioning with osteoarthritis suggests difficulties in adjusting manual work patterns for a person with osteoarthritis, which may have increased during the study period as implied by the separate effect of the 1980s.'",3
"b'Fibroblast growth factors FGF-1 and FGF-2 mediate their biological effects via heparan sulfate-dependent interactions with cell surface FGF receptors. While the specific heparan sulfate domain binding to FGF-2 has been elucidated in some detail, limited information has been available concerning heparan sulfate structures involved in the recognition of FGF-1. In the current study we present evidence that the minimal FGF-1 binding heparan sulfate sequence comprises 5-7 monosaccharide units and contains a critical trisulfated IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide unit. N-Sulfated heparan sulfate decasaccharides depleted of FGF-1 binding domains showed dose-dependent and saturable binding to FGF-2. These data indicate that the FGF-1 binding domain is distinct from the minimal FGF-2 binding site, previously shown to contain an IdoA(2-OSO3) residue but no 6-O-sulfate groups. We further show that the FGF-1 binding heparan sulfate domain is expressed in human aorta heparan sulfate in an age-related manner in contrast to the constitutively expressed FGF-2 binding domain. Reduction of heparan sulfate O-sulfation by chlorate treatment of cells selectively impedes binding to FGF-1. The present data implicate the 6-O-sulfation of IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 units in cellular heparan sulfate in the control of the biological activity of FGF-1.'",2
"b'Glycoconjugates are abundant and ubiquitious on the surface of many protozoan parasites. Their tremendous diversity has implicated their critical importance in the life cycle of these organisms. This review highlights our current knowledge of the major glycoconjugates, with particular emphasis on their structures, of representative protozoan parasites, including Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Giardia, Plasmodia, and others.\r\nProtozoan parasites have evolved unique lifestyles, often shuttling between their intermediate carriers and vertebrate hosts, encountering extremely harsh environments specifically designed to keep such microbial invaders at bay. Their survival strategies frequently involve the participation of glycoconjugates that form a protective barrier against hostile forces. In fact, a common feature of the parasite\x92s cell surface architecture is the presence of an elaborate and often highly decorated glycocalyx that allows the parasite to interact with and respond to its external environment.\r\n\r\nFrom the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei to the various phosphoglycans of Leishmania, these molecules are essential for parasite virulence. The diversity of the glycoconjugate structures and consequently the range of functions that have been ascribed to these molecules, from host cell invasion to the deception of the host\x92s immune system, is simply astounding. Also interesting is the observation of parallels and similarities in structure that underscore evolutionary relationships between the different parasites. For example, an overwhelming number of these surface glycoconjugates are glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchored even though their functions are vastly different.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this mini review is to highlight the known structures of the major glycoconjugates of representative protozoan parasites, with brief reference to their diverse roles in parasite virulence (Table I). We will not describe, however, the structures of GPI anchors in any great detail because several excellent reviews have been published on the subject (McConville and Ferguson, 1993Go; Ferguson, 1999Go) nor will we review the biosynthetic pathways.'",2
"b'This report reviews a series of studies demonstrating a relationship between the consumption of sweets and alcohol consumption. There is consistent evidence linking the consumption of sweets to alcohol intake in both animals and humans, and there are indications that this relationship may be at least partially genetic in nature. Alcohol-preferring rats have a tendency to consume sucrose and saccharin solutions far beyond the limits of their normal fluid intake and this has been proposed to be a model of the clinical phenomenon known as loss of control. Furthermore, rats and mice, genetically bred to prefer alcohol, tend to choose more concentrated sweet solutions, compared to animals which do not prefer alcohol. Similar tendencies to prefer ultra-sweet solutions have been noted in studies of alcoholic subjects, with most alcoholics preferring sweeter sucrose solutions than do controls. Evidence also exists that those alcoholics who prefer sweeter solutions may represent a familial form of alcoholism. Finally, consumption of sweets and/or sweet solutions may significantly suppress alcohol intake in both animals and in alcoholics. Carbohydrate structure and sweet taste may contribute to this effect through different physiological mechanisms involving serotonergic, opioid, and dopaminergic functions. The possibility that there is concordance between sweet liking and alcohol consumption and/or alcoholism has theoretical, biological, and diagnostic/practical implications.'",0
"b'Background To re-evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) seroprevalence during pregnancy, we carried out a population-based cohort study.\r\n\r\nMethods IgG and IgM antibodies to HCMV and IgG avidity were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in three different socioeconomic areas (SEA) in the 9\x9612th week of pregnancy of 1088 consecutive mothers.\r\n\r\nResults The overall IgG seropositivity was 70.7%, ranging from 60.9 to 76.4% in \x91upper\x92 to \x91lower\x92 SEA (P = 0.0004). The HCMV IgM seropositivity was 4.0%, ranging from 3.8% in the \x91upper\x92 and \x91intermediate\x92 SEA to 4.6% in the \x91lower\x92 SEA. Serologically acute cases, defined by low avidity of IgG, represented 1.7% of the pregnancies in the \x91upper\x92 SEA compared with 1.0 and 1.1% in the other two areas. In the \x91lower\x92 SEA there were twice as many recurrent infections as in the others, 3.6 versus 1.7%. The low impact of age did not increase after elimination of the effects of SEA and parity. Miscarriages were associated neither with IgG nor with IgM positivity, although the percentage of >=2 miscarriages was 8.8% in seronegative women compared with 11.2% and 13.6% in IgG- and IgM-positive women.\r\n\r\nConclusions Social environment seems to be the most powerful factor, predicting both IgG seroprevalence and recurrences during pregnancy.'",3
"b'The mechanism by which HIV causes depletion of CD4 lymphocytes remains unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that HIV binding to resting CD4 lymphocytes causes them to home from the blood into lymph node, and during the homing process, they are induced into apoptosis only to secondary signals through the homing receptors. If this is the principal mechanism of CD4 cell depletion, it can explain many of the events known to occur in HIV-infected individual.'",4
"b'To test the hypotheses that average volume of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking, each influence alcohol-related problems and that both act at individual and aggregate levels. Methods: The 2003 cycle of the Ontario Student Drug Use Survey obtained self-administered questionnaires from a representative classroom-based survey of 2455 Ontario secondary school students (grades 9\x9612) from 74 schools, with a student completion rate of 72%. Average volume of alcohol consumption was assessed using a quantity-frequency measure. Heavy drinking occasions were operationalized by four dummy variables indicating less than monthly, monthly, weekly and daily consumption of five or more drinks per occasion, with never having a heavy drinking occasion serving as the reference group. Alcohol-related problems were measured by using seven items of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Results: As hypothesized, both the average volume of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking influenced alcohol-related problems at the student level, independently of each other. At the school level, both determinants significantly influenced the problems, but not when simultaneously entered into the equation. Conclusions: Future prevention of alcohol-related problems in adolescents should consider both the average volume and patterns of drinking. Both prevention and research should also try to include environmental determination of alcohol-related problems.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'In contrast to most organs, the anatomy of the liver may allow naive CD8+ T cells to make direct contact with liver parenchymal cells. We have previously shown, using a combination of TCR transgenic T cells specific for H-2 Kb and hepatocytes expressing a transgenic H-2 Kb molecule, that hepatocytes can induce antigen-specific activation and proliferation of naive CD8+ T cells independently of CD28 co-stimulation. However, T cell activation by hepatocytes leads to premature T cell death and tolerance, bothin vivo andin vitro. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of T cell death induced by hepatocytesin vitro using primary hepatocytes to activate purified CD8+ T cells. Neither Fas nor tumor necrosis factor receptor were involved, indicating that hepatocyte- induced death was distinct from activation-induced cell death. Before they started to divide, T cells activated by hepatocytes expressed lower levels of thebcl-xL survival gene and 30 times less IL-2 mRNA than CD8+ cells activated by splenic antigen-presenting cells. Since CD28 co-stimulation increases both IL-2 andbcl-xL expression, this suggests that hepatocyte-activated T cells die by neglect because they fail to receive effective co-stimulatory signals. In agreement with this model, premature death promoted by hepatocytes could be prevented by cross-linking CD28. Survival after CD28 cross-linking correlated with increased IL-2 andbcl-xL expression, and sustained T cell proliferation, while cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was prolonged as compared with cells stimulated without CD28 co-stimulation. This study confirms that high- affinity TCR transgenic antigen-specific CD8+ T cells can be activated to proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells. However, prolonged T cell survival and cytotoxicity required CD28 co-stimulation as well. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that tolerance in the context of lack of CD28 co-stimulation can result from Fas-independent peripheral deletion rather than from anergy.'",4
"b""Two distinct sulfonoglycolipid fractions were isolated from the basidiolichen Dictyonema glabratum by chromatography on Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose, which resulted in rapid elution, followed by partition between aqueous sulfuric acid and an ethyl acetate-methanol-chloroform mixture and the content of the organic layer chromatographed of a column of silicic acid. The products were examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in their native rather than their acetylated forms, as in previous investigations. Each was methanolyzed to give the same methyl glycoside, Me-G. On electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), it provided a pseudomolecular ion at m/z 303 in the positive-ion mode and a molecular ion at m/z 257 with a daughter ion at m/z 146 in the negative-ion mode, showing the presence of a sulfonate group S-linked to a hexosyl ring. An exclusively {alpha}-glucopyranosyl configuration was indicated by 1H, 1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and 1H, 1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY). S-substitution occurred at CH2-6, because a high-field 13C signal at {delta} 52.6 gave an inverted distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) signal and 1H, 3C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) showed correlation with two H-6 signals. This 6-sulfono-{alpha}-quinovopyranoside group was present in the glycolipid fractions, O-{alpha}-D-Quip-6-sulfono-(1'{leftrightarrow}1)-2,3-diacyl-D-glycerol (polar fraction 1a; PF1a) and O-{alpha}-D-Quip-6-sulfono-(1'{leftrightarrow}1)-2- or -3-monoacyl-D-glycerol (polar fraction 1b; PF1b), the monoacyl derivatives not having been previously completely characterized in other systems. All components are typical of plant glycolipids. The most abundant fatty acid ester in PF1a and PF1b was C16:0. Other esters present in PF1a were C14:0, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1 (oleic), C20:0, C21:0, and C24:0, in contrast with C14:0, C17:0, C18:0, and C20:0 in PF1b. HMQC and TOCSY data can be used as fingerprints for detection of glycosylacylglycerides and sulfonoglycolipids and the positive ESI-MS ions at m/z 329 and 271 for identification of the latter.""",2
"b""Previous work on figure\x96ground coding in monkey V1 revealed enhanced spike rates within an object's surface representation, synchronization of gamma oscillations ({gamma} = 35\x9690 Hz) in object and background regions, but no decrease in signal correlation across the representation of a contour. The latter observation seems to contradict previous statements on the role of {gamma}-synchronization for scene segmentation. We re-examine these findings by analyzing different coupling measures and frequency ranges of population activities potentially contributing to figure\x96ground segregation. Multiple unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded by parallel \xb5-electrodes in monkey V1 during stimulation by a grating in which an object was defined by a shifted rectangle. In contradiction to the conclusions in previous work, we find strong decoupling of population activity between figure and ground representations compared to the situation in which the object is absent. In particular, coherence of late{gamma}-LFPs is strongly reduced, while reduction is absent during the early epochs of high-amplitude transients for LFP- and MUA-coherence at all frequencies, and at low frequencies also in the subsequent epochs. Our results of decoupling in late LFP {gamma}-components among figure and ground representations suggest that these signals may support figure\x96ground segregation.""",1
"b'The surrogate light chain (SL) is composed of two polypeptides, Vpre-B and {lambda}5. In large pre-BII cells the SL chain associates with Ig \xb5 heavy chain (\xb5H) to form the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). In mice there are two Vpre-B genes which are 98% identical within the coding regions. The two genes are co-expressed at the RNA level and encode functional proteins that can assemble with {lambda}5. However, it is not known whether both gene products serve the same function in vivo. Here we have established mice that lack the Vpre-B1 gene (VpreB1\x96/\x96), but still express the Vpre-B2 gene, both as RNA and protein. In Vpre-B1\x96/\x96 mice, the bone marrow cellularity and the percentage of B220+ cells is normal. However, among the B220+ cells, the percentage of pre-BI cells is increased, and the percentage of pre-BII and immature B cells is slightly decreased, suggesting that the lack of Vpre-B1 causes a partial block at the transition from pre-BI to pre-BII cells, i.e. into the pre-BCR stage. The number of cells that produce a functional pre-BCR is thus lower, but the cells that reach this stage are normal as they can be expanded by proliferation and then differentiate into more mature cells. The spleens of Vpre-B1 homozygous mutant mice show normal numbers of B and T lymphocytes. Moreover, the Ig loci are allelicly excluded and the homozygous mutant mice respond with normal levels of antigen-specific antibodies to T-dependent antigens. These results demonstrate that Vpre-B2 alone is capable of supporting B lymphocyte development in the bone marrow and can give rise to immuno-competent cells in the periphery.'",4
"b'In order to better understand the role of intestinal CD1d, we sought to define the cellular localization and further characterize the biochemical structure of CD1d in human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Using a CD1d-specific rabbit anti-gst\x96CD1d antibody, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cell surface proteins detected a previously identified 37 kDa protein as well as a 48\x9650 kDa protein which were confirmed by Western blotting with a CD1d-specific mAb, D5. Immunoprecipitation of protein lysates with the CD1d-specific mAb, D5 and 51.1.3, and the \xdf2-microglobulin (\xdf2m)-specific mAb, BBM.1, followed by N-glycanase digestion and Western blotting with the D5 mAb showed that the 48\x9650 kDa protein was a \xdf2m-associated, CD1d glycoprotein. CD1d was immunolocalized to the apical and lateral regions of native small and large intestinal IEC as defined by confocal laser microscopy using the D5 mAb and the rabbit anti-gst\x96CD1d antibody. In addition, a large apical intracellular pool of CD1d was identified. Identical observations were made with polarized T84 cells. Selective biotin labeling of apical and basolateral cell surfaces followed by immunoprecipitation with the D5 mAb, N-glycanase digestion and avidin blotting confirmed the presence of glycosylated CD1d on both cell surfaces and immunolocalization of the 37 kDa non-glycosylated form of CD1d to the apical cell surface. These studies show that CD1d is located in an ideal position for luminal antigen sampling and presentation to subjacent intraepithelial lymphocytes.'",4
"b'The N-glycosylation pattern of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), isolated from brains of newborn mice, has been analyzed. Following digestion with trypsin, generated glycopeptides were fractionated by serial immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing polysialic acid (PSA) units or the HNK1-carbohydrate epitope. Subsequent analyses of the resulting (glyco)peptides by Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) revealed polysialylated glycans to be exclusively linked to glycosylation sites 5 (Asn431) and 6 (Asn460), whereas glycans carrying the HNK1-epitope could be assigned to sites 2 (Asn297), 5, 6, and, to a lesser extent, site 3 (Asn329). PSA-, HNK1-, and non-PSA/HNK1-glycan fractions were characterized by carbohydrate constituent and methylation analyses as well as MALDI-TOF-MS in conjunction with chromatographic fractionation techniques. The results revealed that the core structures of PSA-glycans represented predominantly fucosylated, partially sulfated 2,6-branched isomers of triantennary as well as tetraantennary complex-type glycans, whereas carbohydrate chains bearing the HNK1-epitope were dominated by diantennary species carrying in part bisecting GlcNAc residues. Non-PSA/HNK1-glycans exhibited a highly heterogeneous pattern of partially truncated, mostly diantennary structures being characterized by the presence of additional fucose, bisecting GlcNAc and/or sulfate residues. In conclusion, our results revealed that the glycosylation pattern of murine NCAM displays high structural and regional selectivity, which might play an important role in controlling the biological activities of this molecule.'",2
"b'A general introduction to a discussion on growth and health might take either of two main forms. It might review what we know about the material requirements for growth: the total energy needs, the grams of protein required to give this or that amount of soft tissue growth, the grams of calcium and phosphorus required for growth of the skeleton; it might discuss the functional importance of substances that make little material contribution to growth, and finally, sum up what we know about the inter-relation of diet and resistance to infection. These are the subjects with the details of which most of the observational and experimental work in nutrition is, at the moment, concerned. It would take days to sum up the information; and, when that had been done, I doubt whether we should be able to do more than reaffirm general principles. These general principles are already well known. The concept of a balanced diet has become part of our \x91common knowledge\x92.\r\n\r\nPerhaps partly because I shirked that major task, and partly because I think it is good, now and then, to lay aside the microscope and look at things with the naked eye, I have chosen the second approach. In very general terms I am going to ask what we mean by good growth and health and what the one has to do with the other.\r\n\r\nIn experimental work with animals most often weight increase is taken as if it were synonymous with growth; less often growth is defined as increase in one or more linear dimensions. Obviously increase in weight may be increase in bone or muscle or fat or merely water or some combination of any or all of these; and some linear dimensions may be just as difficult to interpret. But suppose we had some complicated technique combining weights and measures and isotope studies and specific gravity of the body, what would it tell us about growth? It would be no more than a means to a crude chemical analysis without killing the subject, and, by itself, it would be just as interesting or as sterile as any other chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nBefore we can get up any real interest in the result we must know what changes in the structure and composition of the body mean in terms of some standard of value. What is value in growth? Why do we say this animal or person is well grown and that is not? We mean a great deal more, I think, than merely that the one is bigger or heavier than the other. The term well grown and the attitude of mind behind it imply some target of performance which we consider to have been approximated or missed.'",3
"b""We report the first detailed population-based maps of cortical gray matter loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing prominent features of early structural change. New computational approaches were used to: (i) distinguish variations in gray matter distribution from variations in gyral patterns; (ii) encode these variations in a brain atlas (n = 46); (iii) create detailed maps localizing gray matter differences across groups. High resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes were acquired from 26 subjects with mild to moderate AD (age 75.8 \xb1 1.7 years, MMSE score 20.0 \xb1 0.9) and 20 normal elderly controls (72.4 \xb1 1.3 years) matched for age, sex, handedness and educational level. Image data were aligned into a standardized coordinate space specifically developed for an elderly population. Eighty-four anatomical models per brain, based on parametric surface meshes, were created for all 46 subjects. Structures modeled included: cortical surfaces, all major superficial and deep cortical sulci, callosal and hippocampal surfaces, 14 ventricular regions and 36 gyral boundaries. An elastic warping approach, driven by anatomical features, was then used to measure gyral pattern variations. Measures of gray matter distribution were made in corresponding regions of cortex across all 46 subjects. Statistical variations in cortical patterning, asymmetry, gray matter distribution and average gray matter loss were then encoded locally across the cortex. Maps of group differences were generated. Average maps revealed complex profiles of gray matter loss in disease. Greatest deficits (20\x9630% loss, P < 0.001\x960.0001) were mapped in the temporo-parietal cortices. The sensorimotor and occipital cortices were comparatively spared (0\x965% loss, P > 0.05). Gray matter loss was greater in the left hemisphere, with different patterns in the heteromodal and idiotypic cortex. Gyral pattern variability also differed in cortical regions appearing at different embryonic phases. 3D mapping revealed profiles of structural deficits consistent with the cognitive, metabolic and histological changes in early AD. These deficits can therefore be (i) charted in a living population and (ii) compared across individuals and groups, facilitating longitudinal, genetic and interventional studies of dementia.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'revious studies from this Laboratory have shown that cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PN) in ageing, ethanol-fed Fischer 344 rats may have terminal dendritic segments that are longer than in control rats. They also showed that the longer terminal segments represented a toxic effect of ethanol on PN, because their increase in length resulted from an ethanol-induced deletion of other terminal dendritic segments and not from dendritic growth. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this effect of ethanol was localized to specific lobules or was widely distributed within all lobules of the cerebellar vermis. Twelve-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were treated with a liquid ethanol diet for 48 weeks. Age- and weight-matched controls were pair-fed with an isocaloric control diet. Terminal dendritic segments in Golgi\x96Cox-stained PN in four groups of lobules in the cerebellar vermis of control and ethanol-fed rats were measured for treatment-related changes in length. Results from these measurements showed that ethanol-exposed PN with significantly longer terminal segments were present in all groups of lobules, i.e. they were widely distributed and not confined to specific lobules. Results from these measurements also confirmed in a large sample of neurons (40 neurons per rat) that the topologically distinct unpaired terminal segments were characteristically longer than the paired terminal segments in PN of control and ethanol-fed rats and that both types of terminal segments were longer in the ethanol-fed rats than in the controls.'",0
"b'Background This study aims to investigate the relationship between birthweight and psychological function, as evaluated by the results of a psychological conscript interview and assessment in young males, including an evaluation of stress susceptibility.\r\n\r\nMethods We performed a retrospective cohort study based on linked birth registry data and data from an assessment of psychological function during evaluation for military service. In all, 90 651 young males born 1973\x961975, for whom birth record data were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, were investigated in addition to psychological stress susceptibility during their conscript evaluation in 1991\x961994. The assessment of psychological functioning score, including the assessment of stress susceptibility, was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis in combination with the following independent variables: birthweight, adult weight, head circumference at birth, month of birth, gestational age, maternal parity, and maternal age.\r\n\r\nResults The mean value was 5.1 (SD 1.9) on the psychological assessment scale (range 1\x969) of psychological level of functioning including evaluation of stress susceptibility, and 5.3 (1.6) on the general psychological performance (leadership) profile. A positive association was seen between birthweight and better assessment results up to a level of about 4000 g birthweight, but above that an inverse association was seen. Positive correlations (P < 0.001) were seen between psychological assessment score results and birthweight (r = 0.07), gestational age (0.03), head circumference (0.05), and maternal age (0.11), but inverse correlations with maternal parity (\x960.11) and birth month of the offspring (\x960.04). In multiple regression analyses, the strongest independent correlations were seen between increasing assessment scores and maternal age and birthweight (positive), as well as with maternal parity and offspring adult weight (negative).\r\n\r\nConclusion Young males at conscript testing show a better general psychological functioning score derived from psychological assessment, including evaluation of stress susceptibility, with increasing birthweight up to 4200 g. Above that birthweight an inverse association is noticed. Impaired fetal growth is predictive of suboptimal psychological functioning and increased stress susceptibility in males during early adult life.\r\n\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\r\nLow birthweight and impaired fetal growth have been associated with various adult disease manifestations and increased cardiovascular mortality in epidemiological studies from different populations. \r\nNeuropsychological development may be negatively influenced by reduced fetal growth, with one possible consequence being impaired cognitive function and increased stress susceptibility in adolescense and adult life. \r\nWe examined 90 651 Swedish conscripts for associations between birthweight, adjusted for other birth variables, and scores from a psychological assessment including an evaluation of stress susceptibility. \r\nAssessment scores for psychological functioning continuously improved up to a birthweight of 4200 g, followed by a decreasing trend above this birthweight level. \r\nImpaired fetal growth seems to influence not only cognitive function, which has been shown before, but also assessed susceptibility to stress\x97a factor of possible importance for adverse cardiovascular reactions with long-term detrimental effects.

"b'Background Reduced lung function has been shown to be a significant predictor of non-fatal ischaemic heart disease, and of mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Fewer studies have analysed the relationship between lung function and risk of fatal or non-fatal stroke. The present study presents results on the relation between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and risk of incident and fatal first-ever stroke.\r\n\r\nSubjects and Methods The analyses are based on prospective cohort data from 12 878 eligible men and women aged 45\x9684 years, who participated in the first health examination of the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1976\x961978. The subjects were followed from day of entry until 31 December 1993. During that period 808 first-ever strokes occurred of which 153 were fatal within 28 days. Risk of incident and fatal stroke was estimated by means of Cox hazard regression. The analyses included adjustment for potential confounders: sex, age, smoking, inhalation, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, physical activity in leisure time, education, diabetes mellitus, and antihypertensive treatment.\r\n\r\nResults We found an inverse association between FEV1 and risk of first-time stroke. For each 10% decrease in FEV1 in percentage of expected, the relative risk (RR) increased 1.05 (95% CI : 1.00\x961.09, P = 0.03). This represents an approximately 30% higher risk of stroke in the group of people with the lowest lung function as compared to the group with the highest lung function. The association between lung function and risk of fatal stroke resembled that of risk of incident stroke (fatal and non-fatal). The RR was 1.11 (95% CI : 1.03\x961.19) for each 10% decrease in FEV1 in percentage of expected. This represents approximately a doubling of the risk between the highest and lowest lung function groups.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study shows that reduced lung function measured in percentage of predicted FEV1 is a predictor of first-time stroke and fatal stroke independent of smoking and inhalation. The high risk of fatal first-ever stroke in the group of people with low lung function may be of significance in both the design and interpretation of clinical trials.'",3
"b'Dolichol phosphate mannose synthase, an essential enzyme in glycoprotein biosynthesis, was partially purified from E.histolytica by hydrophobic interaction and affinity chromatography with octyl Sepharose CL-4B and Affi-Gel 501, respectively. Reducing agents, particularly dithiothreitol, positively influenced enzyme activity and stability, indicating a role of sulfhydryl groups on the transferase function. Activity did not depend on phospholipids; however, it was significantly stimulated by phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lower extent by other common phospholipids. Mixtures consisting of activating phospholipids did not exert an additive effect. In vitro phosphorylation with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in enzyme activation. This alteration was not associated with a change in the Km for the substrate but rather with a 2.6-fold increase in Vmax. Phosphorylation in the presence of [{gamma}-32P]ATP resulted in strong labeling of two polypeptides, one of which exhibited the molecular mass reported for the enzyme from other organisms. Whether phosphorylation functions in vivo as a mechanism of regulation of dolichol phosphate mannose synthesis in E.histolytica remains to be determined.'",2

The present work, part of a more extensive study to validate a new rating scale to measure emotional dependence, the Dependence Self-rating Scale (DSRS), assesses dependence, orientation of locus of control, parental bonding perceptions, and personality disorders (PDs) in alcoholic and non-alcoholic samples. The alcoholics showed a prevalence of PDs of 31.3%. The most frequent is the Schizoid PD (40%) followed by the Dependent PD (20%). Subjects with antisocial PD were not included in our selection criteria. The alcoholics scored higher on the DSRS than the controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. By making a comparison between subjects with and without PDs, the DSRS scores were significantly higher in alcoholics with PDs. No significant differences between alcoholics and non-alcoholics in the parental perceptions and locus of control were seen. These findings are sufficiently coherent to encourage further studies on psychological emotional dependence in alcoholics using the DSRS.'",0
"b""The N-glycosylation sites of human Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein from one healthy male donor have been characterized, based on an approach using endoproteinase Glu-C (V-8 protease, Staphylococcus aureus) digestion and a combination of chromatographic techniques, automated Edman sequencing, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Seven out of the eight potential N-glycosylation sites, namely, Asn52, Asn56, Asn208, Asn251, Asn298, Asn372, and Asn489, turned out to be glycosylated, and the potential glycosylation site at Asn14, being close to the N-terminus, is not used. The carbohydrate microheterogeneity on three of the glycosylation sites was studied in more detail by high-pH anion-exchange chromatographic profiling and 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Glycosylation site Asn489 contains mainly di- and tri-charged oligosaccharides which comprise, among others, the GalNAc4S([beta]1-4)GlcNAc terminal sequence. Only glycosylation site Asn251 bears oligomannose-type carbohydrate chains ranging from Man5GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2, in addition to a small amount of complex-type structures. Profiling of the carbohydrate moieties of Asn208 indicates a large heterogeneity, similar to that established for native human Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, namely, multiply charged complex-type carbohydrate structures, terminated by sulfate groups, sialic acid residues, and/or the Sda-determinant.\r\nHuman Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THp) is the most abundant protein in normal human urine, being excreted in quantities of up to 100 mg/day (Tamm and Horsfall, 1950; Tamm and Horsfall, 1952). THp is produced by the kidney where it is expressed via a phosphatidylinositol anchor on the endothelium of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Sikri et al., 1979; Rindler et al., 1990). The physiological function of THp is still controversial. THp could act as a natural inhibitor of microbial infection of the urinary tract and urinary bladder (Duncan, 1988; Parkkinen et al., 1988). A possible relation between THp and the electrolyte/water transport in the nephron has been described previously (Mattey and Naftalin, 1992) as well as a role in the formation of kidney stones (Hallson and Rose, 1979; Scurr and Robertson, 1986). The ability to inhibit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation in vitro probably due to the glycan part of the protein has been reported but the results are ambiguous (Muchmore et al., 1987; Moonen et al., 1988). Furthermore, the carbohydrate chains of THp have been implicated in the binding to neutrophils (Toma et al., 1994) and in immunosuppressive properties (Sathyamoorthy et al., 1991).\r\n\r\nIn earlier studies, it has been found that THp built up from a polypeptide backbone of 616 amino acids, has a carbohydrate content of 25-30% (w/w) (Kumar and Muchmore, 1990), distributed over eight potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn14, Asn52, Asn56, Asn208, Asn251, Asn298, Asn372, and Asn489 (Hession et al., 1987; Pennica et al., 1987), of which at least five are occupied (Afonso et al., 1981). So far, no data have been reported about the specific asparagine residues involved in the glycosylation, nor about the heterogeneity of the carbohydrate chains at each occupied glycosylation site.\r\n\r\nDetailed structural studies of the total glycosylation pattern of THp from individual male donors have resulted in the elucidation of 63 complex-type N-glycans, which form only part of the 150 isolated carbohydrate-containing fractions (H\xe5rd et al., 1992; van Rooijen et al., 1998a, b; see also Donald et al., 1983; Serafini-Cessi et al., 1984b; Williams et al., 1984; Donald and Feeney, 1986). Di-, tri-, and, most of all, tetraantennary structures (including dimeric N-acetyllactosamine sequences) are present which can be fucosylated, sialylated (including the Sda-determinant) and/or sulfated. Furthermore, oligomannose-type carbohydrate chains are reported for THp from pooled urine of various individuals ranging from Man5GlcNAc2 to Man7GlcNAc2 (Serafini-Cessi et al., 1984a; Dall'Olio et al., 1988; Smagula et al., 1990).\r\n\r\nIn this study, a detailed analysis of the glycosylation sites of THp is presented in order to contribute to the unraveling of the biological functions of human THp.""",2
"b'Previous studies (Q. Bao and R. C. Hughes (1995) J. Cell Sci., 108, 2791-2800) showed that the [beta]-galactoside-binding protein, galectin-3, is secreted onto the basolateral surface domains of Madin-Darby canine kidney MDCK cells growing as polarized cysts within a collagen gel. The growth and enlargement of such cysts were shown to be increased significantly when cultured in the presence of antibodies directed against the lectin and were slowed down by addition of exogenous galectin-3. These results suggested a role for galectin-3, interacting with appropriately glycosylated surface receptors, as a negative growth regulator in the development of MDCK cysts, a well-known model for renal epithelial morphogenesis. In the present report we have tested this proposal by use of a ricin-resistant mutant of MDCK cells that is unable to transfer galactose residues during biosynthesis of cellular glycoconjugates and hence lacks extracellular receptors for galectin-3. We find that when grown within collagen gels, the mutant cell cysts grow significantly faster than wild-type cell cysts. Furthermore, they form nonspherical and tubular cysts that are induced in wild-type cell cysts only under the influence of the morphogen, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).'",2
"b'Understanding the changes in the brain which occur in the transition from normal to addictive behavior has major implications in public health. Here we postulate that while reward circuits (nucleus accumbens, amygdala), which have been central to theories of drug addiction, may be crucial to initiate drug self-administration, the addictive state also involves disruption of circuits involved with compulsive behaviors and with drive. We postulate that intermittent dopaminergic activation of reward circuits secondary to drug self-administration leads to dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex via the striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit. This is supported by imaging studies showing that in drug abusers studied during protracted withdrawal, the orbitofrontal cortex is hypoactive in proportion to the levels of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. In contrast, when drug abusers are tested shortly after last cocaine use or during drug-induced craving, the orbitofrontal cortex is hypermetabolic in proportion to the intensity of the craving. Because the orbitofrontal cortex is involved with drive and with compulsive repetitive behaviors, its abnormal activation in the addicted subject could explain why compulsive drug self-administration occurs even with tolerance to the pleasurable drug effects and in the presence of adverse reactions. This model implies that pleasure per se is not enough to maintain compulsive drug administration in the drugaddicted subject and that drugs that could interfere with the activation of the striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit could be beneficial in the treatment of drug addiction.'",1
"b'Chemokines and their receptors play critical roles in the selective recruitment of various subsets of leukocytes. Recent studies have indicated that some chemokine receptors are differentially expressed on Th1 and Th2 cells. However, available data concerning the presence of T cells with a Th1 or a Th2 character and the expression of chemokine receptors on infiltrating T cells in the rheumatic joint are still limited. In this study, we investigated the expression of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and CCR5, which have been shown to be preferentially expressed on Th2 and Th1 respectively on T cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Although both CCR5+ and CCR4+ CD4+ T cell populations were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy controls and osteoarthritis patients, these cell populations were decreased in patients with active RA. In contrast, the vast majority of synovial fluid (SF) T cells from active RA patients expressed CCR5 but not CCR4. CCR5 ligands, MIP-1{alpha} and RANTES, were found in RA SF at high levels. CCR5+ CD4+ T cells from SF mononuclear cells of RA patients produced IFN-{gamma} but not IL-4 in response to anti-CD3 stimulation in vitro. These results indicated that differential expression of chemokine receptors plays a critical role for selective recruitment of pro-inflammatory T cells into the joints of RA.'",4
"b""The method of affinity coelectrophoresis was used to study the binding of nine representative glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins, all thought to play roles in nervous system development, to GAGs and proteoglycans isolated from developing rat brain. Binding to heparin and non-neural heparan and chondroitin sulfates was also measured. All nine proteins-laminin-1, fibronectin, thrombospondin-1, NCAM, L1, protease nexin-1, urokinase plasminogen activator, thrombin, and fibroblast growth factor-2-bound brain heparan sulfate less strongly than heparin, but the degree of difference in affinity varied considerably. Protease nexin-1 bound brain heparan sulfate only 1.8-fold less tightly than heparin (Kd values of 35 vs. 20 nM, respectively), whereas NCAM and L1 bound heparin well (Kd ~140 nM) but failed to bind detectably to brain heparan sulfate (Kd > 3 \xb5M). Four proteins bound brain chondroitin sulfate, with affinities equal to or a few fold stronger than the same proteins displayed toward cartilage chondroitin sulfate. Overall, the highest affinities were observed with intact heparan sulfate proteoglycans: laminin-1's affinities for the proteoglycans cerebroglycan (glypican-2), glypican-1 and syndecan-3 were 300- to 1800-fold stronger than its affinity for brain heparan sulfate. In contrast, the affinities of fibroblast growth factor-2 for cerebroglycan and for brain heparan sulfate were similar. Interestingly, partial proteolysis of cerebroglycan resulted in a >400-fold loss of laminin affinity. These data support the views that (1) GAG-binding proteins can be differentially sensitive to variations in GAG structure, and (2) core proteins can have dramatic, ligand-specific influences on protein-proteoglycan interactions.""",2
"b'The complement system is a cascade of serum proteins and receptors which forms a vital arm of innate immunity and enhances the adaptive immune response. This work establishes the chromosomal localization of four key genes of the murine complement system. Mapping was performed using a novel and rapid PCR restriction length polymorphism method which was developed to exploit the murine expressed sequence tag (EST) database. This technique circumvents the laborious cDNA or genomic cloning steps of other mapping methods by relying on EST data and the prediction of exon\x96intron boundaries. This method can be easily applied to the genes of other systems, ranging from the interests of the individual researcher to large-scale gene localization projects. Here the complement system, probably one of the most well-characterized areas of immunology, was used as a model system. It was shown that the C3a receptor C1r and C1s genes form an unexpected complement gene cluster towards the telomeric end of chromosome 6. The second mannose binding lectin-associated serine protease gene was mapped to the telomeric end of chromosome 4, which is distinct from other complement-activating serine proteases. These results provide new insights into the evolution of this group of proteins.'",4
"b'The combined analysis of the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases c-Kit and Flt3/Flk-2 and of the human CD25 gene expressed as a transgene under the regulation of the mouse {lambda}5 promoter in the bone marrow of 1-week-old mice allows us to identify three stages of B lymphocyte development before the CD19+c-Kit+ pre-B-I cells. Single-cell PCR analysis of the rearrangement status of the Ig heavy chain alleles allows us to order these early stages of B cell development as follows: (i) B220+CD19\x96c-KitloFlt3/Flk-2hi{lambda}5\x96, (ii) B220+CD19\x96c-KitloFlt3/Flk-2hi{lambda}5+ and (iii) B220+CD19+c-KitloFlt3/Flk-2lo{lambda}5+ before B220+CD19+c-KitloFlt3/Flk-2\x96{lambda}5+ pre-B-I cells. All these progenitors are clonable on stromal cells in the presence of IL-7 and can differentiate to CD19+c-Kit\x96 B-lineage cells. A combination of stem cell factor, Flt3 ligand and IL-7 was also able to support the proliferation and differentiation of the progenitors in a suspension culture. Furthermore, the analyses indicate that the onset of DHJH rearrangements precedes the expression of the {lambda}5 gene. These progenitor populations were characteristic of juvenile mice and could not be detected in the bone marrow of adult mice. Hence the expression pattern, and probably the function, of the receptor tyrosine kinases in early B cell differentiation appears to be different in juvenile and adult mice.'",4
"b'Ceramide is a pivotal molecule in signal transduction and an essential structural component of the epidermal permeability barrier. The epidermis is marked by a high concentration of ceramide and by a unique spectrum of ceramide species: Besides the two ceramide structures commonly found in mammalian tissue, N-acylsphingosine and N-2-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine, six additional ceramides differing in the grade of hydroxylation of either the sphingosine base or the fatty acid have been identified in the epidermis. Here we report on the characterization of an IgM-enriched polyclonal mouse serum against ceramide. In dot blot assays with purified epidermal lipids the antiserum bound to a similar extent to N-acyl-sphingosine (ceramide 2), N-acyl-4-hydroxysphinganine (ceramide 3), and N-(2-hydroxyacyl)-sphingosine (ceramide 5), whereas no specific reaction was detected with glycosylceramides, sphingomyelin, free sphingosine, phospholipids, or cholesterol. In contrast, a monoclonal IgM antibody, also claimed to be specific for ceramide, was shown to bind specifically to sphingomyelin and therefore was not further investigated. In thin-layer chromatography immunostaining with purified lipids a strong and highly reproducible reaction of the antiserum with ceramide 2 and ceramide 5 was observed, whereas the reaction with ceramide 1 and ceramide 3 was weaker and more variable. Ceramide 2 and ceramide 5 were detected in the nanomolar range at serum dilutions of up to 1:100 by dot blot and thin-layer immunostaining. In thin-layer chromatography immunostaining of crude lipid extracts from human epidermis, the antiserum also reacted with N-(2-hydroxyacyl)-4-hydroxysphinganine (ceramide 6) and N-(2-hydroxyacyl)-6-hydroxysphingosine (ceramide 7). Furthermore, the suitability of the antiserum for the detection of endogenous ceramide by immunolight microscopy was demonstrated on cryoprocessed human skin tissue. Double immunofluorescence labeling experiments with the anti-ceramide antiserum and the recently described anti-glucosylceramide antiserum (Brade et al., 2000Go, Glycobiology 10, 629) showed that both lipids are concentrated in separate epidermal sites. Whereas anti-ceramide stained the dermal and basal epidermal cells as well as the corneocytes, anti-glucosylceramide staining was concentrated in the stratum granulosum. In conclusion, the specificity and sensitivity of the reagent will enable studies on the subcellular distribution and biological functions of endogenous ceramide.'",2
"b'Helper T cells are classified into Th1 and Th2 subsets based on their profiles of cytokine production. Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas Th2 cells induce humoral responses. Selective recruitment of these two subsets depends on specific adhesion molecules and specific chemoattractants. Here, we demonstrate that the T cell-directed CC chemokine thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) was abundantly produced by monocytes treated with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or IL-3, especially in the presence of IL-4 and by dendritic cells derived from monocytes cultured with GM-CSF + IL-4. The receptor for TARC and another macrophage/dendritic cell-derived CC chemokine macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is CCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor. CCR4 was found to be expressed on ~20% of adult peripheral blood effector/memory CD4+ T cells. T cells attracted by TARC and MDC generated cell lines predominantly producing Th2-type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5. Fractionated CCR4+ cells but not CCR4\x96 cells also selectively gave rise to Th2-type cell lines. When naive CD4+ T cells from adult peripheral blood were polarized in vitro, Th2-type cells selectively expressed CCR4 and vigorously migrated toward TARC and MDC. Taken together, CCR4 is selectively expressed on Th2-type T cells and antigen-presenting cells may recruit Th2 cells expressing CCR4 by producing TARC and MDC in Th2-dominant conditions.'",4
"b'his and the following two papers describe event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by visual stimuli in 98 patients in whom electrodes were placed directly upon the cortical surface to monitor medically intractable seizures. Patients viewed pictures of faces, scrambled faces, letter-strings, number-strings, and animate and inanimate objects. This paper describes ERPs generated in striate and peristriate cortex, evoked by faces, and evoked by sinusoidal gratings, objects and letter-strings. Short-latency ERPs generated in striate and peristriate cortex were sensitive to elementary stimulus features such as luminance. Three types of face-specific ERPs were found: (i) a surface-negative potential with a peak latency of ~200 ms (N200) recorded from ventral occipitotemporal cortex, (ii) a lateral surface N200 recorded primarily from the middle temporal gyrus, and (iii) a late positive potential (P350) recorded from posterior ventral occipitotemporal, posterior lateral temporal and anterior ventral temporal cortex. Face-specific N200s were preceded by P150 and followed by P290 and N700 ERPs. N200 reflects initial face-specific processing, while P290, N700 and P350 reflect later face processing at or near N200 sites and in anterior ventral temporal cortex. Face-specific N200 amplitude was not significantly different in males and females, in the normal and abnormal hemisphere, or in the right and left hemisphere. However, cortical patches generating ventral face-specific N200s were larger in the right hemisphere. Other cortical patches in the same region of extrastriate cortex generated grating-sensitive N180s and objectspecific or letter-string-specific N200s, suggesting that the human ventral object recognition system is segregated into functionally discrete regions.'",1
"b'Drinking, but not alcohol-dependent, 18\x9629-year-old daughters of alcoholics (n = 38) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism were compared to 75 family-history-positive (FHP) men from the same families, and 68 family-history-negative (FHN) male controls. Subjects received 0.75 ml/kg of ethanol (for women), 0.9 ml/kg of ethanol (for men), and placebo, each of which was consumed over 8 min on different occasions. The breath-alcohol concentrations (BrAC) and reactions to alcohol [using the Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS) and body sway measures] were evaluated over 210 min. The results indicate that, despite slightly higher BrAC values for the FHP men, on the SHAS the FHP women and the FHP men demonstrated significantly lower scores than the FHN male controls, although the values for FHP men and women did not differ. On body sway, the FHP men showed evidence of less alcohol-related increases than FHN men, and there was a trend in the same direction for FHP women, but only early in the session (e.g. at 60 min). Pilot data for 11 FHN women revealed higher scores for both SHAS and body sway at 60 min, compared to FHP women, but, perhaps reflecting the small number of subjects, the family history differences were not significant. Overall, the results in FHP women resemble those for FHP men, and suggest that a low level of response to alcohol might also be a characteristic of daughters of alcoholics.'",0
"b""Peyer's patch (PP) organogenesis proceeds through three histologically distinct steps: formation of organizing centers expressing VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in segregated regions of the intestine at 15.5 days post-coitus (d.p.c.) (step I), accumulation of blood cells expressing different sets of surface markers to this region at 16.5\x9617.0 d.p.c. (step II), and entry of CD3+ and B220+ lymphocytes just before birth (step III). PP formation of both Il7ra\x96/\x96 and Lta\x96/\x96 mice is impaired from step I, suggesting involvement of the two molecules at the same timing in PP organogenesis. Expression of lymphotoxin (LT) {alpha} and LT\xdf in IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) {alpha}+ cells in the intestine indicates that defects of Il7ra\x96/\x96 and Lta\x96/\x96 mice are due to functional inability of IL-7R{alpha}+ cells in the induction of PP anlage. Blocking of IL-7R{alpha} function by a single injection of the antagonistic mAb in 15.5 d.p.c. embryos suppressed appearance of VCAM-1+ spots and expression of LT{alpha} and LT\xdf in the intestine, which eventually resulted in mice without PP but are otherwise normal. Intestinal IL-7R{alpha}+ cells are lymphoid in morphology but CD3\x96 and functional in both nu/nu and Rag2\x96/\x96 mice. These results implicate IL-7R{alpha}+ CD3\x96 cells as the direct inducer of the organizing center of PP.""",4

"b'Young and old adults underwent positron emission tomographic scans while encoding pictures of objects and words using three encoding strategies: deep processing (a semantic living/nonliving judgement), shallow processing (size judgement) and intentional learning. Picture memory exceeded word memory in both young and old groups, and there was an age-related decrement only in word recognition. During the encoding tasks three brain activity patterns were found that differentiated stimulus type and the different encoding strategies. The stimulus-specific pattern was characterized by greater activity in extrastriate and medial temporal cortices during picture encoding, and greater activity in left prefrontal and temporal cortices during encoding of words. The older adults showed this pattern to a significantly lesser degree. A pattern distinguishing deep processing from intentional learning of words and pictures was identified, characterized mainly by differences in prefrontal cortex, and this pattern also was of significantly lesser magnitude in the old group. A final pattern identified areas with increased activity during deep processing and intentional learning of pictures, including left prefrontal and bilateral medial temporal regions. There was no group difference in this pattern. These results indicate age-related dysfunction in several encoding networks, with sparing of one specifically involved in more elaborate encoding of pictures. These age-related changes appear to affect verbal memory more than picture memory.'",1
"b'Integrin-associated protein (IAP/CD47) is a 50 kDa transmembrane protein initially defined as a regulator of \xdf3 integrin-mediated functions in neutrophils. IAP also can synergize with the TCR in T cell activation independent of \xdf3 integrins. To analyze the mechanism for IAP synergy with TCR, we expressed in Jurkat cells a chimeric molecule, consisting of the CD16 extracellular domain, the CD7 transmembrane domain and the TCR {zeta} chain cytoplasmic tail (CD16-7-{zeta}), which on its own is unable to induce IL-2 production. Ligation of IAP acted in synergy with TCR to induce IL-2 transcription and synthesis, but failed to synergize with the signal generated by CD16-7-{zeta}, while CD28 was a potent co-stimulator with both TCR and CD16-7-{zeta}. The failure of IAP to activate Jurkat together with CD16-7-{zeta} correlated with a lack of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activation. Jurkat adhesion to anti-IAP, but not anti-CD28, induced cell spreading and the same domains of IAP required for augmentation of T cell activation were required to induce cell spreading. IAP synergy with TCR signaling likely results from its ability to stimulate adhesion to a ligand-expressing surface or antigen-presenting cell (APC), rather than from initiation of a novel signaling cascade. We conclude that a major role for ligation of IAP in T cell activation is to enhance the efficiency of TCR signaling by causing T cells to spread on an APC or surface.'",4
"b'There is increasing evidence from cellular recordings in primates and behavioral studies in humans that motion can be processed by other than the magnocellular (M) pathway and the cortical dorsal stream. Little is known about cortical processing of moving stimuli when the information is conveyed by the third retinogeniculocortical pathway \x97 the so-called koniocellular (K) pathway. We addressed this issue in humans by studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of the brain electrical fields evoked by tritan (S-cone isolating) and luminance-defined moving stimuli. Tritan and luminance stimuli are presumably carried by the K and M pathways respectively. We found two time intervals where significant stimulus-specific electric fields were evoked: an early period between 40 and 75 ms after stimulus onset, and a later period between 175 and 240 ms. Some of these fields were identical for tritanand luminance-motion, suggesting that the processing of moving stimuli share common cortical substrates when mediated via K and M pathway input. However, tritan-motion stimuli also evoked unique electric fields that appeared earlier in time than the common motion-specific fields, indicating very fast activation of cortical areas specific to input through the K pathway. A distributed source localization procedure revealed simultaneous activation of striate and extrastriate areas even at the early processing stages, strongly suggesting a very fast activation of the visual cerebral network.'",1
"b'The primate orbitofrontal cortex contains the secondary taste cortex, in which the reward value of taste is represented. It also contains the secondary and tertiary olfactory cortical areas, in which information about the identity and also about the reward value of odors is represented. The orbitofrontal cortex also receives information about the sight of objects and faces from the temporal lobe cortical visual areas, and neurons in it learn and reverse the visual stimulus to which they respond when the association of the visual stimulus with a primary reinforcing stimulus (such as a taste reward) is reversed. However, the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in representing negative reinforcers (punishers) too, such as aversive taste, and in rapid stimulus\x96reinforcement association learning for both positive and negative primary reinforcers. In complementary neuroimaging studies in humans it is being found that areas of the orbitofrontal cortex (and connected subgenual cingulate cortex) are activated by pleasant touch, by painful touch, by rewarding and aversive taste, and by odor. Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex in humans can impair the learning and reversal of stimulus\x96 reinforcement associations, and thus the correction of behavioral responses when these are no longer appropriate because previous reinforcement contingencies change. This evidence thus shows that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in decoding and representing some primary reinforcers such as taste and touch; in learning and reversing associations of visual and other stimuli to these primary reinforcers; and in controlling and correcting reward-related and punishment-related behavior, and thus in emotion.'",1
"b'We have generated a database of 639 glycosidic linkage structures by an exhaustive survey of the available crystallographic data for isolated oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycan-binding proteins. For isolated oligosaccharides there is relatively little crystallographic data available. A much larger number of glycoprotein and glycan-binding protein structures have now been solved in which two or more linked monosaccharides can be resolved. In the majority of these cases, only a few residues can be seen. Using the 639 glycosidic linkage structures, we have identified one or more distinct conformers for all the linkages. The O5-C1-O-C(x)[prime] torsion angles for all these distinct conformers appear to be determined chiefly by the exo-anomeric effect. The Man[alpha]1-6Man linkage appears to be less restrained than the others, showing a wide degree of dispersion outside the ranges of the defined conformers. The identification of distinct conformers for glyco-sidic linkages allows \x93average\x94 glycan structures to be modeled and also allows the easy identification of distorted glycosidic linkages. Such an analysis shows that the interactions between IgG Fc and its own N-linked glycan result in severe distortion of the terminal Gal[beta]1-4GlcNAc linkage only, indicating the strong interactions that must be present between the Gal residue and the protein surface. The applicability of this crystallographic based analysis to glycan structures in solution is discussed. This database of linkagestructures should be a very useful reference tool in three-dimensional structure determinations.'",2
"b'A 6-month randomized controlled study of acamprosate versus placebo in preventing relapse following withdrawal from alcohol was undertaken in 20 centres throughout the UK. Patients diagnosed as alcohol-dependent and detoxified within the preceding 5 weeks were randomly assigned to treatment with either acamprosate (A) 666 mg three times/day or identical placebo (P). A total of 664 patients were screened; 581 were entered into the treatment phase. One-third were episodic drinkers, 84% were male, 44% were unmarried and 48% were unemployed. Medication was first taken on average 24 days after the start of detoxification; 32% of patients had already relapsed by this time. The 6-month study period was completed by 35% of patients; adverse events led to withdrawal of a further 14% (A) and 9% (P) respectively. Compliance was poor in that, by the end of the second week, only 57% of patients were judged to be taking at least 90% of their tablets. The mean total of abstinent days achieved was 77 (A) and 81 (P). Complete abstinence for 6 months was achieved by 12% (A) and 11% (P); drinking remained within controlled limits in a further 3% (A) and 6% (P). An effect of acamprosate on consumption was not seen when subgroups, including those defined by the Lesch typology, were analysed separately. However, the mean percentage reduction in craving for alcohol measured on a visual analogue scale was greater in the acamprosate, than placebo, patients at week 2 and week 4 (P < 0.001) and the mean decrease in the Hamilton Anxiety score at the 4th week was greater in the acamprosate than placebo patients (P = 0.017). In comparison with other published trials of acamprosate, patients started study medication after a longer time following detoxification, had more often recommenced drinking before medication was started and had a higher drop-out rate, and this might have contributed to the lack of a treatment effect in this study.'",0
"b'We report on a pilot double-blind study on the effectiveness of divided doses of chlordiazepoxide and a single daily dose of diazepam in the treatment of the alcohol-withdrawal syndrome. While a variety of drugs (chlormethiazole, propranolol and clonidine) have been used for treatment of alcohol-withdrawal symptoms, benzodiazepines remain the drugs of choice for alcohol detoxification (Mayo-Smith, 1997Go). Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are both longer-acting benzodiazepines, and preferred for detoxification (Williams and McBride, 1998Go). Traditionally, chlordiazepoxide has been the benzodiazepine of choice due to its lower dependence and abuse potential, whereas diazepam has been used in patients with a history of alcohol-withdrawal seizures.\r\n\r\nIn view of the accent on community detoxification, we undertook this pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of a single daily dose of diazepam in detoxification. Consecutive in-patients with severe alcohol-dependence syndrome, who gave informed consent, were included in the study. Patients with severe physical illness or psychiatric co-morbidity were excluded. All patients had a semi-structured alcohol history recorded and completed the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) (Stockwell et al., 1983Go) to quantify the severity of dependence. Patients were randomly allocated, by pharmacy, to one of two double-blind alcohol withdrawal regimes administered four times a day: diazepam once a day (evening dose) with three placebo tablets or chlordiazepoxide four times a day. Both regimes were on a sliding scale over eight days, with a starting daily dose of either 40 mg of diazepam or 80 mg of chlordiazepoxide. Alcohol withdrawal was monitored four times a day using a modified alcohol-withdrawal chart (Sullivan et al., 1989Go) (see Appendix). Pulse, temperature and blood pressure were also monitored four times a day prior to administration of medication. All patients received similar vitamin supplementation. If patients required additional benzodiazepines to overcome withdrawal symptoms, oxazepam 20 mg was available. All patients were prescribed chloral hydrate elixir, 10 ml nocte as a hypnotic, if required.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three consecutive elective admissions for detoxification were assessed for inclusion in the study. Three patients, all male, were withdrawn at the time of assessment: one had a subdural haematoma, one had manifest agitation felt to be a feature of psychosis, and one patient took immediate self-discharge prior to medication being administered. The two populations were similar in age, duration of problem drinking, units of alcohol consumed per week, alcolmeter reading, and SADQ on admission (Table 1Go). No patient required any supplementary medication; neither oxazepam nor chloral hydrate elixir were needed and no adverse events were recorded. As shown in Figure 1Go, the mean pulse rate in both groups showed no significant difference on days 1, 2, 5 or 8 although significance was noted on day 6 (P < 0.05) and day 7 (P < 0.05). This anomaly is difficult to explain; there was no record of clinical concern on these days and no significant difference in the scores for alcohol withdrawal. Both medications were effective with withdrawal symptoms (Fig. 2Go). The difference noted on days 5, 6, and 8 (though not significant) is explained by the high scores of one particular patient, patient 5, which skewed the mean. While withdrawal scores for all patients improved consistently, patient 5 remained anxious with no clinical evidence of alcohol withdrawal.The relatively small sample of this study precludes extrapolating significance from the results. Regrettably, limited finance for placebo tablets necessitated that only 23 patients could be included in the study. However during this pilot study, no patients required adjuvant medication or developed severe complications. We would suggest that the option of a single daily dose of diazepam is attractive in uncomplicated community detoxification with appropriate monitoring of withdrawal symptoms.'",0
"b'Acamprosate (calcium bis acetyl-homotaurine), a homotaurine derivative, a structural analogue of  {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and an upper homologue of taurine, is a relatively new drug used to prevent relapse in weaned alcoholics. When administered orally as enteric-coated tablets at relatively high doses, this drug has a bioavailability of about 11%; however, the intestinal absorption mechanism has not been studied in depth. The present study was therefore planned to characterize the intestinal transport of acamprosate in the rat and the effect of chronic alcohol treatment on this process, quantifying its kinetic parameters and investigating possible inhibitors. Using an in vitro technique, acamprosate absorption was measured in the rat intestine from three different groups: alcohol group [fed a liquid diet containing 5% (w/v) ethanol for 4 weeks], isocaloric pair-fed control, and a solid diet group. Intestinal acamprosate absorption was found to occur mainly by passive diffusion with a diffusive permeability of 0.213 \xb1 0.004 cm/h in control pair-fed animals, 0.206 \xb1 0.001 cm/h in animals receiving chronic alcohol treatment, and 0.193 \xb1 0.001 cm/h in the solid diet group. Inhibition studies showed that at a 10\x963 M acamprosate concentration, some compounds such as GABA, taurine, proline, and glycine at 40 mM each did not affect acamprosate transport. Nevertheless, when a lower concentration of the drug (10\x964 M was assayed, a significant reduction of acamprosate transport in the presence of taurine or GABA 40 mM was found. These results suggest that acamprosate in the rat jejunum, could be transported, in part, by a carrier system. Further experiments using different concentrations of taurine (10, 20, and 80 mM) showed that the maximum inhibition (32%) is achieved at 20 mM of taurine. These latter results suggest that acamprosate and taurine share, at least, an intestinal carrier system in rat jejunum. From the above results, it can be concluded that there are probably two pathways involved in the intestinal absorption of acamprosate: passive diffusion and mediated transport, with the former being predominant. Moreover, neither chronic ethanol intake nor the type of diet seems to alter the intestinal absorption of the drug.'",0
"b""High endothelial venules (HEV) allow rapid and selective lymphocyte trafficking from the blood into secondary lymphoid tissues. Here we report the expression profile of active genes in mouse high endothelial cells (HEC). HEC were first purified from mouse lymph nodes (LN) by magnetic cell sorting with MECA-79 mAb and a 3'-directed cDNA library that faithfully represents the composition of mRNA was constructed. A total of 1495 cDNA sequences were obtained from randomly selected clones. Based on their sequence identity, they were grouped into 754 different species [gene signatures (GS)] of which 335 GS were identified in GenBank. Among the previously identified genes, expression of several endothelial cell surface molecules including endoglin and ICAM-1 was detected in HEC. Comparison of the gene expression profile with that of purified CD31+ flat endothelial cells identified several molecules, such as KC chemokine and Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines, that are known to be selectively expressed in activated endothelial cells or post-capillary venules. Interestingly, mac25/TAF, which is known to be expressed specifically in tumor vessels and implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion, was highly and selectively expressed in HEC in mouse LN, suggesting that it may participate in regulating HEC-specific functions. Comparison with the expression profiles obtained from 35 different cell types showed at least 22 GS that were apparently specific to HEC. Our results illustrate the expression differences between HEC and CD31+ flat endothelial cells, and will be useful for the identification and characterization of genes specific for HEC""",4
"b'Most cell surface molecules are glycoproteins consisting of linear arrays of globular domains containing stretches of amino acid sequence with similarities to regions in other proteins. These conserved regions form the basis for the classification of proteins into superfamilies. Recombinant soluble forms of six leukocyte antigens belonging to the Ly-6 (CD59), scavenger receptor (CD5), and immunoglobulin (CD2, CD48, CD4, and Thy-1) superfamilies were expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cell line, thus providing an opportunity to examine the extent to which N-linked oligosaccharide processing might vary in a superfamily-, domain-, or protein-dependent manner in a given cell. While we found no evidence for superfamily-specific modifications of the glycans, marked differences were seen in the types of oligosaccharides attached to individual proteins within a given superfamily. The relative importance of local protein surface properties versus the overall tertiary structure of the molecules in directing this protein-specific variation was examined in the context of molecular models. These were constructed using the 3D structures of the proteins, glycan data from this study, and an oligosaccharide structural database. The results indicated that both the overall organization of the domains and the local protein structure can have a large bearing on site-specificglycan modification of cells in stasis. This level of control ensures that the surface of a single cell will display a diverse repertoire of glycans and precludes the presentation of multiple copies of a single oligosaccharide on the cell surface. The glycans invariably shield large regions of the protein surfaces although, for the glycoproteins examined here, these did not hinder the known active sites of the molecules. The models also indicated that sugars are likely to play a role in the packing of the native cell surface glycoproteins and to limit nonspecific protein-protein interactions. In addition, glycans located close to the cell membrane are likely to affect crucially the orientation of the glycoproteins to which they are attached.'",2
"b'In monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), long-distance, horizontally oriented intrinsic axon collaterals interconnect clusters of pyramidal neurons in the supragranular layers. In order to study the electrophysiological responses mediated by these long-distance projections, an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC was used to obtain whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo tracer injections, we found that long-distance projections were well preserved in PFC slices cut in the coronal plane. Postsynaptic currents were evoked by low-intensity electrical extracellular stimulation applied successively to 20\x9630 discrete sites located up to 2200 \xb5m lateral to the recorded cell. Several criteria were applied to discriminate between monoand polysynaptic responses. Long-distance monosynaptic connections were mediated by fibers with relatively slow conduction velocity (0.14 m/s). Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by stimulation of shortor long-distance horizontal connections did not differ in kinetic properties. The majority (77%) of the 35 layer 3 PFC neurons studied were monosynaptic targets of long-distance connections. EPSCs mediated by long-distance connections had amplitudes that were similar or even larger than short-distance EPSCs, suggesting that excitatory input provided by the former was relatively robust. For most neurons (87.5%) in which a full complement of monosynaptic EPSCs was evoked by multisite stimulation, the EPSC amplitude as a function of stimulation distance from the recorded cells exhibited statistically significant peaks. The spacing between peaks was similar to the spacing between interconnected clusters of neurons observed in previous anatomical studies. The results show that long-distance excitatory connections constitute a significant intrinsic pathway of synaptic communication in layer 3 of monkey PFC.'",1
"b'This communication reviews recent literature and summarizes current views on the immunomodulatory effects of acute and chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic and even acute, moderate alcohol use can increase host susceptibility to infections caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. Impaired host defence after alcohol exposure appears to be linked to a combination of decreased inflammatory response, altered cytokine production, and abnormal reactive oxygen intermediate generation. Furthermore, cellular immunity, particularly antigen-specific immune response, is impaired by both acute and chronic alcohol use. Although T lymphocyte functions can be directly affected by ethanol, decreased antigen presenting cell function appears to be a key element in the ethanol-induced decrease in cell-mediated immunity. In addition, a preferential induction of Th2 vs Th1 immune response has been suggested, based on the increased immunoglobulin levels seen in chronic alcoholics. The effects of chronic and acute alcohol consumption in humans, animal models and in vitro systems on host defence and immunity are discussed in the context of the functional abnormalities of T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes/macrophages resulting in the altered immune response seen after alcohol use.'",0
"b'Epidemiological studies suggest that abstinence periods in some patients with alcohol dependence may increase their cardiovascular risk via proatherogenic changes in plasma lipid levels. Because of this, drugs administered in withdrawal therapy should not exacerbate these effects. The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of naltrexone, carbamazepine, and lithium carbonate on plasma lipid levels in 160 alcohol-dependent males during withdrawal therapy. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TGL) were determined every 2 weeks for 20 weeks. Pharmacotherapy (naltrexone 50 mg, carbamazepine 600\x96800 mg, lithium carbonate 500\x961000 mg once per day or placebo) was given within the framework of a double-blind study between the fourth and twentieth weeks of the study. The results of 116 patients who maintained abstinence during the whole 20-week observation period were analysed. In patients treated with naltrexone significant decreases in TC (239 \xb1 58 vs 216 \xb1 52 mg/dl; P < 0.01) and TGL (125 \xb1 68 vs 86 \xb1 33 mg/dl; P < 0.02) concentrations after 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy were observed. In patients treated with carbamazepine, significant increases in TC (224 \xb1 39 vs 243 \xb1 54 mg/dl, P < 0.04) and HDL (40 \xb1 10 vs 44 \xb1 8 mg/dl, P < 0.01) after 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy were observed. After 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy, patients treated with naltrexone had lower mean TC (P < 0.03) and LDL-C (P < 0.01) concentrations than patients treated with carbamazepine, lower mean LDL-C levels than patients treated with lithium carbonate (149 \xb1 54 vs 164 \xb1 57 mg/dl, P < 0.01), and lower TGL concentrations than patients of the remaining pharmacotherapy groups. We conclude that naltrexone, by its hypolipaemic effect, could be useful for withdrawal therapy in alcoholic patients, because it may decrease the cardiovascular risk in abstinent patients with alcohol dependence by lipid mechanisms.'",0
"b""This article reviews and interprets neuronal activities related to the expectation and delivery of reward in the primate orbitofrontal cortex, in comparison with slowly discharging neurons in the striatum (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum, including nucleus accumbens) and midbrain dopamine neurons. Orbitofrontal neurons showed three principal forms of reward-related activity during the performance of delayed response tasks, namely responses to reward-predicting instructions, activations during the expectation period immediately preceding reward and responses following reward. These activations discriminated between different rewards, often on the basis of the animals' preferences. Neurons in the striatum were also activated in relation to the expectation and detection of reward but in addition showed activities related to the preparation, initiation and execution of movements which reflected the expected reward. Dopamine neurons responded to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli, and coded an error in the prediction of reward. Thus, the investigated cortical and basal ganglia structures showed multiple, heterogeneous, partly simultaneous activations which were related to specific aspects of rewards. These activations may represent the neuronal substrates of rewards during learning and established behavioral performance. The processing of reward expectations suggests an access to central representations of rewards which may be used for the neuronal control of goaldirected behavior.""",1
"b'CD26, a 110 kDa cell surface glycoprotein, exhibits dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV; EC 3.4.14.5) enzyme activity and plays an important role in T cell co-stimulation. In the present study, the function of CD26/DPPIV in transendothelial migration was examined using \xdf-chemokines as chemoattractants. When soluble recombinant CD26 (sCD26/DPPIV+) was added to the transendothelial chemotaxis system, chemotactic migration of T cells toward RANTES was significantly enhanced. Addition of sCD26 to 50 ng/ml of RANTES enhanced the migratory response by a factor of two compared to RANTES alone, whereas mutant soluble CD26 (mCD26), lacking the DPPIV enzyme activity, had no enhancing effect on RANTES-induced T cell migration. In the process of analyzing the mechanisms of the enhancement of T cell migration by sCD26, we showed that RANTES was cleaved by sCD26 under physiologic conditions at the precise site characteristic of its enzyme specificity. However, synthesized RANTES which lacks two N-terminal amino acids showed a chemotactic activity equivalent to full-length RANTES on T cells. Furthermore, addition of sCD26 showed enhancement of T cell migration induced by both forms of RANTES. In contrast to T cells, the truncated RANTES is inactive in chemotaxis of purified monocytes and supplement of sCD26 but not mCD26 reduced the migratory response of monocytes to RANTES. These results suggest that CD26/DPPIV differentially regulate the chemotactic response of T cells and monocytes to RANTES.'",4
"b'In this study we provide evidence that the low expression of IGF-1R at the cell surface of estrogen-independent breast cancer cells is due to a low rate of de novo synthesis of dolichyl phosphate. The analyses were performed on the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line MDA231 and, in comparison, the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2, which expresses a high number of plasma membrane-bound IGF-1R. Whereas the MDA231 cells had little or no surface expression of IGF-1R, they expressed functional (i.e., ligand-binding) intracellular receptors. By measuring the incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into dolichyl phosphate, we could demonstrate that the rate of dolichyl phosphate synthesis was considerably lower in MDA231 cells than in SK-MEL-2 cells. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation of the [alpha]-subunit of IGF-1R was 8-fold higher in the melanoma cells. Following addition of dolichyl phosphate to MDA231 cells, N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R was drastically increased, which in turn was correlated to a substantial translocation of IGF-1R to the plasma membrane, as assayed by IGF-1 binding analysis and by Western blotting of plasma membrane proteins. The dolichyl phosphate-stimulated receptors were proven to be biochemically active since they exhibited autophosphorylation. Under normal conditions MDA231 cells, expressing very few IGF-1R at the cell surface, were not growth-arrested by an antibody ([alpha]IR-3) blocking the binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R. However, after treatment with dolichyl phosphate, leading to a high cell surface expression of IGF-1R, [alpha]IR-3 efficiently blocked MDA231 cell growth. Taken together with the fact that the breast cancer cells produce IGF-1 and exhibit intracellular binding, our data suggest that the level of de novo-synthesized dolichyl phosphate may be critical for whether the cells will use an intracellular or an extracellular autocrine IGF-1 pathway.'",2
"b'J chain is associated with pentameric IgM and dimeric IgA via disulfide bonds involving the penultimate cysteine residue in the secretory tailpiece of the \xb5 or the {alpha} heavy chain. We have investigated the structural basis for incorporation of J chain by analyzing several IgM mutants, IgA mutants and IgG/IgM hybrid molecules. IgM mutants with the \xb5 secretory tailpiece replaced by the {alpha} secretory tailpiece and/or Cys414 replaced by serine incorporated J chain, although in reduced amounts correlating with reduced pentamer/polymer formation. In addition to pentamers, tetramers of IgMC414S contained J chain, while no J chain was associated with smaller polymers or hexamers of IgM. An IgA/IgM hybrid tailpiece abolished J chain incorporation to pentameric IgM. Analysis of IgG molecules that have added a secretory tailpiece and/or have IgM domain replacements showed that J chain incorporation depends on regions of the C\xb54 domain in addition to the tailpiece. Features of the C\xb53 domain other than Cys414 also play a role in efficient formation of pentamers and J chain incorporation, while the C\xb52 domain is not specifically required. By analysis of two IgA mutants that formed larger polymers than IgAwt, we found J chain equally incorporated into dimers, trimers, tetramers and pentamers. Thus, the results show that J chain incorporation into IgA does not depend on the polymeric structure, while J chain incorporation into IgM is restricted to certain polymeric conformations'",4
"b'A variety of observations have suggested that the dopamine and serotonin systems may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of major mental disorders of childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. A recent triple immunofluorescence study has demonstrated a convergence of serotonin and dopamine fibers onto both pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCx). These findings are consistent with the results of an electrophysiological study conducted in another laboratory that suggested such a relationship exists in the pyriform cortex of the rodent brain. During postnatal development, the dopamine system shows a progressive ingrowth of fibers into this region that continues until the early adult period. In contrast, GABAergic neurons appear to complete their postnatal maturation by the fourth postnatal week (the early post-weanling period). As dopamine fibers infiltrate the rat mPFCx, they progressively increase their interaction with neural elements within the neuropil and with the cell bodies of both pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons. This process appears to be influenced by the serotonin system, since lesioning of the nucleus raphe dorsalis during the neonatal period results in a significant increase of dopamine fibers. This finding suggests that lesions of the serotonin system induce plasticity of the cortical dopamine system; however, it is not known whether this inferred suppressive effect of serotonin fibers occurs at brainstem levels or within the mPFCx itself. Taken together, these various studies suggest that the convergence of dopamine and serotonin fiber systems on intrinsic cortical neurons shows considerable plasticity during postnatal life that could theoretically contribute to the development of \x91miswired\x92 circuits in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We describe mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) strain NL4-3, which are lacking the thirteenth, fifteenth, or seventeenth sites for N-linked glycosylation (g13, g15, g17) of the envelope protein gp120. All three sites are located within the hypervariable V3 loop region of gp120. Those mutants lacking carbohydrates g15 or combinations of g15/g17 showed markedly higher infectivity for GHOST cells (human osteosarcoma cells) expressing CXCR4 (GHOST-X4), compared to the fully glycosylated NL4-3 wild type virus. In addition, these mutants could also infect cells which exhibits low background expression of CXCR4, corresponding to <10% of that observed for GHOST-X4 cells. In addition to the enhanced infectivity observed, mutants lacking g15 and g17 showed increased resistance to inhibition by SDF-1, the natural ligand of CXCR4. Thus, loss of the oligosaccharides g15 and g17 in the V3 region of gp120 markedly influences CXCR4-specific infection.'",2
"b'{alpha}-1,4-Glucan lyase cleaves {alpha}-1,4-linkages of nonreducing termini of {alpha}-1,4-glucans to produce 1,5-anhydrofructose (1,5-AnFru). The enzymes isolated from fungi and algae show high homology with glycoside hydrolase family 31. Purification of {alpha}-1,4-glucan lyase from rat liver using DEAE Cellulose chromatography resulted in separation of two enzymatic active fractions, one was bound to the column and the other was in the flow-through. Partial amino acid sequence determined from the lyase, retained on the anion exchange column, were identical with that of the N-linked oligosaccharide processing enzyme glucosidase II. The lyase showed similar enzymatic properties as the microsomal glucosidase such as inhibition by 1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine. On the other hand, glucosidase II purified from rat liver microsomes produced not only glucose but also a small amount of 1,5-AnFru using maltose as substrate. Furthermore, CHO cells overexpressing pig liver glucosidase II showed a 1.5- to 2-fold higher lyase activity compared to the nontransfected CHO cells. Conversely, no lyase activity was detectable either in PHAR2.7, the glucosidase II-deficient mutant from a mouse lymphoma cell line, or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YG427 having the glucosidase II gene disrupted. These data demonstrate that glucosidase II possesses an additional enzymatic activity of releasing 1,5-AnFru from maltose.'",2
"b'Background Associations of fat and other macronutrients with breast cancer risk are not clear in areas where fat intake is low.\r\n\r\nMethods We conducted a hospital-based case-control study from 1992 to 1995 in Jakarta, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nResults The study, based on 226 cases and 452 age and socioeconomic status matched controls, provided the following findings. (a) In the pre-marriage period, the greater the fat or protein consumption, the larger the risk, whereas decreasing risk with increasing carbohydrate intake was detected. The odds ratio (OR) for the highest quartile of intake relative to the lowest was 8.47 (95% CI : 4.03\x9617.8) for fat, 2.19 (95% CI : 1.30\x963.69) for protein, and 0.16 (95% CI : 0.08\x960.31) for carbohydrate. A positive association with fat and a negative one with carbohydrate were also observed for the post-marriage period, but of weaker magnitude compared to the pre-marriage period. (b) The effects of macronutrient intakes were stronger among premenopausal than among postmenopausal women. (c) Most of the associations of protein and carbohydrate were insignificant after adjustment for fat intake.\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings suggest that fat intake might be an important determinant of breast cancer among populations with a low fat diet in Indonesia.'",3
"b'We previously reported that a ganglioside mixture from bovine brain could prevent neuronal death and promote regeneration in rats with hypoglossal nerve resection. In the present study, we have compared the neurotrophic effects of various glycosphingolipids including lactosyl-ceramide. The findings revealed that GT1b had the activity of neuronal death prevention equivalent to a ganglioside mixture or autograft, while other glycolipids exhibited about 60% activity. However, the capability to promote the regeneration varied among glycolipids, that is, GT1b (86%), GD1b (55%), GD1a (35%), GQ1b (34%), GM1 (20%), lactosyl-ceramide (17%) in the number of horseradish peroxidase\x96positive neurons as an indicator of regeneration. The experiments with oligosaccharides of GT1b or GD1b and ceramide showed that the carbohydrate moiety mainly exerts neurotrophic effects. These findings suggested that fine structures of carbohydrate moiety in gangliosides are critical in the regenerative activity in this hypoglossal nerve regeneration system.'",2
"b'NOD mice spontaneously develop type I diabetes resulting from autoimmune destruction of their insulin-producing \xdf cells. Among the self-antigens targeted by NOD autoimmune T cells is a peptide, p277, from the sequence of the 60 kDa heat shock protein (hsp60). Common to the anti-p277 T cell populations of NOD mice is an idiotope, C9, that spans the CDR3 region of the C9 TCR. We now report: (i) that the C9 idiotope peptide can be presented directly to anti-C9 anti-idiotypic T cells by C9 T cells, (ii) that spontaneous anti-C9 anti-idiotypic T cell activity falls as disease progresses, but immunization can activate the anti-idiotypic T cells to regulate the autoimmune process, (iii) that the anti-idiotypic T cells secrete IFN-{gamma}, but appear to control the disease by down-regulating the IFN-{gamma} produced by the pathogenic population of anti-p277 T cells, (iv) that intrathymic administration of the C9 idiotope peptide at 1 week of age can accelerate the disease, and (v) that administering the p277 target peptide can up-regulate the anti-idiotypic T cells and arrest the disease process. Thus, the development of NOD diabetes can be regulated by a balance between anti-idiotypic and anti-target peptide autoimmunity, and anti-idiotypic regulation can lead to changes in the cytokine secretion of the autoimmune T cells involved in the disease process.'",4
"b'Several lines of evidence suggest that low-rate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex at 1 Hz reduces the excitability of the motor cortex and produces metabolic changes under and at a distance from the stimulated side. Therefore, it has been suggested that rTMS may have beneficial effects on motor performance in patients with movement disorders. However, it is still unknown in what way these effects can be produced. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether rTMS of the motor cortex (15 min at 1 Hz) is able to modify the voluntary movement related cortical activity, as reflected in the Beretischaftspotential (BP), and if these changes are functionally relevant for the final motor performance. The cortical movement-related activity in a typical BP paradigm of five healthy volunteers has been recorded using 61 scalp electrodes, while subjects performed self-paced right thumb oppositions every 8\x9620 s. After a basal recording, the BP was recorded in three different conditions, counterbalanced across subjects: after rTMS stimulation of the left primary motor area (M1) (15 min, 1 Hz, 10% above motor threshold), after 15 min of sham rTMS stimulation and following 15 min of voluntary movements performed with spatio-temporal characteristics similar to those induced by TMS. The tapping test was used to assess motor performance before and after each condition. Only movement-related trials with similar electromyographic (onset from muscular \x91silence\x92) and accelerometric patterns (same initial direction and similar amplitudes) were selected for computing BP waveforms. TMS- evoked and self-paced thumb movements had the same directional accelerometric pattern but different amplitudes. In all subjects, the real rTMS, but neither sham stimulation nor prolonged voluntary movements, produced a significant amplitude decrement of the negative slope of the BP; there was also a shortening of the BP onset time in four subjects. The effect was topographically restricted to cortical areas which were active in the basal condition, irrespective of the basal degree of activation at every single electrode. No changes in the tapping test occurred. These findings suggest that rTMS of the motor cortex at 1 Hz may interfere with the movement related brain activity, probably through influence on cortical inhibitory networks.'",1
"b'The role of self-peptides bound to MHC molecules in the selection of T cells in the thymus remains controversial. Here, we have tested whether a high-abundance single class II MHC\x96peptide complex has a dominant effect on the repertoire of CD4+ T cells selected by low-abundance class II MHC\x96peptide complexes. For these studies, we have used H-2b mice that lack an invariant chain (Ii) (AbIi\x96) and their transgenic variant (AbAbEpIi\x96) that co-expresses Ab molecules covalently bound with a single peptide Ep(52\x9668). In these latter mice, close to 50% of all Ab molecules are occupied by Ep(52\x9668) peptide. Although the AbEp complex was abundantly expressed in the thymus under conditions excluding negative selection on bone marrow-derived cells, no striking quantitative difference between repertoires of TCR expressed on CD4+ T cells in AbIi\x96 and AbAbEpIi\x96 mice was noticed. Our results are consistent with the view that diverse, low-abundance self-peptides play an important role in thymic positive selection and do not support the notion that dominant, high-abundance peptides may be critical for shaping the TCR repertoire.'",4
"b""Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia (ICL) is defined by a stable loss of CD4+ T cells in the absence of any known cause of immune deficiency. This syndrome is still of undetermined origin. It affects adult patients, some of them displaying opportunistic infections similar to HIV-infected subjects. The hypothesis that the cellular immune defect may be due to biochemical failures of the CD3\x96TCR pathway is investigated here in a patient associating a severe selective CD4+ lymphocytopenia with an increased CD8+ T cell count discovered in the course of a cryptococcal meningitidis. A 40% reduction of T cell proliferation to CD3\x96TCR stimulation is observed only in the CD4+ subpopulation. The early CD3-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylations are conserved in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, and the levels of the T cell protein tyrosine kinases p56Lck, p59Fyn and ZAP-70 are normal. However, we find a 50% reduction of p56Lck kinase activity in the patient's T cells compared to a healthy control donor. p59Fyn activity does not appear to be altered. Nevertheless, we do not find any genetic abnormality of p56Lck. These results thus suggest that a defect of an unknown protein regulating p56Lck activity takes place in this patient's T cells. Taken together, these findings reveal p56Lck alteration in ICL and confirm the critical role of this kinase in the maintenance of the peripheral CD4+ T cell subpopulation.""",4

Examination of the lymph node cell (LNC) response 10 days after antigen administration demonstrated an accentuation of i.v. tolerance induction with anti-CTLA-4 blockade. Anergy was induced in splenocytes by i.v. antigen administration as shown by a decrease in MBP-specific proliferation and IL-2 production, and anti-CTLA-4 potentiated this effect. In addition, i.v. antigen plus anti-CTLA-4 and complete Freund's adjuvant was not encephalitogenic. Interestingly, i.v. tolerance (a single injection) did not inhibit experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and anti-CTLA-4 administration did not alter this phenotype. These results suggest that while the majority of MBP-specific T cells are tolerized by i.v. antigen and that this process is potentiated by anti-CTLA-4 administration, a population of T cells remains that is quite efficient in mediating EAE.""",4

In this study, we examined the effect of one of the monovalent gold compounds, aurothioglucose (AuTG), on the IL-1-induced production of IL-6, IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSF) isolated from three RA patients. IL-6 and IL-8 induction but not GM-CSF induction was inhibited in most of the RSF after pretreatment with AuTG. Since gene expression of these cytokines is known to be under the control of a common transcription factor, NF-{kappa}B, the effect of AuTG on the cellular localization of NF-{kappa}B (p65 subunit) and on NF-{kappa}B\x96DNA binding was examined. Although AuTG treatment did not prevent NF-{kappa}B nuclear translocation, AuTG blocked the DNA-binding activity of NF-{kappa}B when examined in vitro. Morphologically, both metal-specific cell staining using p-dimethylaminobenzylidene rhodamine and transmission electron microscopic examinations demonstrated the accumulation of metal gold in the cytoplama and some organella (mitochondria and lysosomes) of the AuTG-treated RSF. These results indicate that one of the anti-rheumatic actions of AuTG might be through its inhibitory action on NF-{kappa}B.'",4
"b'Together with the frontal and parietal eye fields, the supplementary eye field (SEF) is involved in the performance and control of voluntary and reflexive saccades and of ocular pursuit. This region was first described in non-human primates and is rather well localized on the dorsal surface of the medial frontal cortex. In humans the site of the SEF is still ill-defined. Functional imaging techniques have allowed investigation of the location and function of the SEF. However, there is great variability with regard to the published standardized coordinates of this area. We used here the spatial precision of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to better localize the SEF in individuals. We identified as the SEF a region on the medial wall that was significantly activated when subjects executed self-paced horizontal saccades in darkness as compared to rest. This region appeared to be predominantly activated in the left hemisphere. We found that, despite a discrepancy of >2 cm found in the standardized Talairach coordinates, the location of this SEF-region could be precisely and reliably described by referring to a sulcal landmark found in each individual: the upper part of the paracentral sulcus'",1
"b""The majority of clonotypic CD4+ T cells in the intestinal lamina propria of DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice have an activated/memory phenotype and produce effector cytokines despite the absence of prior exposure to ovalbumin (OVA), the transgene-specific antigen. A small number of splenic T cells have a similar phenotype. Clonotypic T cells from Peyer's patch are intermediate in both phenotype and effector cytokine production. Flow cytometric analysis of cells isolated from thymectomized, OVA-naive DO11.10 mice treated with continuous administration of BrdU indicated that a significant fraction of clonotype-positive T cells in the lamina propria and Peyer's patch were in the cell cycle, with significantly fewer cycling cells in the spleen. Most of the cycling cells from each anatomic site expressed low levels of CD45RB. Effector cytokine expression was enriched in the CD45RBlow populations. These memory/effector cell populations were eliminated in DO11.10/SCID and DO11.10/RAG-2\x96/\x96 mice, suggesting that recognition of non-OVA antigens through a second, non-clonotypic TCR was driving differentiation of memory/effector cells in naive BALB/c DO11.10 mice. Clonotypic CD4+ T cells isolated from DO11.10, but not from DO11.10/SCID or DO11.10/RAG-2\x96/\x96 mice, were stimulated to enter the cell cycle by antigen-presenting cells pulsed with an intestinal bacterial antigen extract. These data provide direct evidence that enteric bacterial antigens can activate transgenic T cells through a second, non-clonotypic TCR, and support the notion that the development and turnover of memory/effector cells in vivo is driven by the intestinal flora.""",4
"b'To investigate the rate of formation and degradation of phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in rat blood as compared to human blood, as a model for a biological marker for ethanol exposure. Methods: Rats were given 9% ethanol in liquid diet for 30 days. Control rats were pair fed with a control liquid diet. Blood and organs were analysed considering PEth formed in vivo. Blood from man, rat, pig and ferret as well as human HepG2 cells and rat C6 glioma cells were studied with respect to formation and degradation of PEth in vitro. PEth was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: Most rat organs accumulated considerable amounts of PEth whereas no PEth was found in the blood. After in vitro incubations of blood with ethanol, PEth was only formed by human blood, in contrast to the other species studied. HepG2 cells and C6 cells, like human blood, formed PEth in vitro but only the two cell lines had enzymatic degradation of PEth. Conclusions: The rat is not suitable as a model for assaying PEth in blood as a consequence of ethanol intake. Human blood seems to be particular in its ability to synthesize PEth and to maintain a stable level of PEth due to the lack of degrading activity.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Background Low to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced mortality, primarily due to a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD). Conversely, heavy drinking increases mortality, mainly due to haemorrhagic stroke and non-cardiovascular diseases. It is important to identify the threshold of alcohol consumption above which the balance of risk and benefit becomes adverse. We examine the relationship between reported alcohol consumption, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, a 10-year CHD risk score and hypertension in women.\r\n\r\nMethods In all, 14 077 female employees aged 30\x9664 years, underwent screening for CVD risk factors. Information was available on a range of personal and lifestyle factors, including height, weight, blood pressure, lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and blood glucose. Age-adjusted means were computed for the risk factors in each of five groups of reported alcohol intake: <1 (non-drinkers), 1\x967, 8\x9614, 15\x9621, >=22 units/week. The relationships between alcohol and a derived coronary risk score and hypertension were also examined.\r\n\r\nResults Increasing consumption was associated with an age-adjusted increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (both P < 0.001), a decline in body mass index, total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL-C ratio, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (all P < 0.001), and no trend in triglycerides (P = 0.06), lipoprotein (a) (P = 0.09) or fasting glucose (P = 0.14). Except for LDL-C (P = 0.06) the relationships remained statistically significant after adjustment for possible confounders. Compared to non-drinkers, there was a decrease in 10-year CHD risk with increasing consumption, with the greatest reduction in risk in women consuming 1\x967 units/week, odds ratio (OR) = 0.79, (95% CI : 0.72\x960.87), and an increase in the prevalence of hypertension among those consuming 15\x9621 units/week, OR = 1.68, (95% CI : 1.14\x962.46).\r\n\r\nConclusions This study provides biological support for an inverse association between alcohol intake and CHD in women, associated with favourable changes in lipid and lipoprotein risk factors. Women consuming 1\x9614 units/week had a reduction in CHD risk, but there was an increased prevalence of hypertension among those consuming >=15 units/week. These data suggest that, in terms of the reduced risk of CVD, women should be advised to restrict their alcohol consumption to <=14 units/week.'",3
"b'Changes in gonadal hormones induced early in life produce substantial, seemingly permanent decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive axon density in sensory, motor and prefrontal regions in the rat cerebral cortex. Less is known, however, about the responsiveness of cortical catecholamines to hormone stimulation during adulthood. In this study we expanded upon an earlier analysis of the effects of acute (4 day) and chronic (28 day) gonadectomy in adult male rats on TH innervation in right hemifield of the cingulate cortex to include assessment of sensorimotor areas previously examined following perinatal gonadectomy, the left cingulate hemifield, and one additional prefrontal area \x96 the dorsal anterior insular cortex. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of immunoreactivity revealed modest, transient declines in innervation in sensorimotor areas 4 days after gonadectomy, and a return to normal innervation densities by 28 days after surgery. In cingulate and insular cortices, however, strikingly depleted axon densities observed following acute gonadectomy rebounded to significantly higher than normal levels of innervation 3 weeks later. All effects were attenuated in gonadectomized animals supplemented with testosterone. Thus, for cortical catecholamine innervation, as for other endpoints of hormone stimulation, gonadal steroid sensitivity appears to change dramatically with lifestage. In adult male rats, this sensitivity is also marked by a seemingly selective vulnerability of catecholamine innervation in prefrontal areas to changes in the hormone environment induced by gonadectomy.'",1
"b'Background As women with a family history of ovarian and/or breast cancer possibly inherit genetic changes that alter their risk of ovarian cancer, other established risk factors for ovarian cancer may influence the risk differently in women with and without a family history of the disease.\r\n\r\nMethods Case-control study conducted between 1983 and 1991 in Northern Italy. Cases were 971 women, under 75 years, with incident, histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, and controls were 2758 women, under 75 years, admitted to hospitals for non-malignant, non-hormone-related conditions, who had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy. Of these, 93 cases and 139 controls had a family history of ovarian and/or breast cancer.\r\n\r\nResults The risk of ovarian cancer increased with irregular menstrual cycles, late age at menopause, natural menopause, nulliparity, never use of oral contraceptives and use of hormone replacement therapy. We computed an \x91adult life risk score\x92 (ALRS) considering the combined effect of these factors. Compared to women without a family history and a low ALRS, the OR was 1.7 for women without family history and high ALRS, 1.4 for women with a family history and low ALRS, and 3.5 for women with a family history and high ALRS.\r\n\r\nConclusions Intervention on selected hormonal risk factors for ovarian cancer might be important for women with a family history of the disease.'",3
"b'One approach to pursuing questions about the neural substrates that support substance abuse-related behaviors involves the use of animal models. Carefully controlled animal experiments can be conducted without the confounds commonly found in studies of human addicts, such as polydrug abuse, variable drug history and premorbid psychiatric conditions. The present paper considers the orbitofrontal and related limbic prefrontal cortex in the context of such models of substance abuse. First, the importance of recognizing the heterogeneous structural and functional nature of orbitofrontal cortex in both rodents and primates is addressed, and the results of studies involving the prefrontal cortex in substance abuse-related behaviors are considered in light of this diversity. Second, data from metabolic mapping studies are described that indicate that the pattern of functional activity within medial and orbitofrontal cortex shifts as the duration of exposure to drugs such as cocaine is extended. These functional differences, in turn, may reflect progressive phases of the addictive process. In order to understand the neurobiological consequences of long-term drug use, it will be important to establish the differing roles played by distinct anatomical territories within orbital and medial prefrontal cortex during the course of chronic substance abuse.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Background Important evidence about the mental health effects of unemployment exist; however, little is known about the possible protective effects of various social interventions or about their long-term impact.

In all 8029 individuals interviewed in both 1987 and 1992 were included in the analysis. A depression index was created from the responses to 15 items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale-D (CES-D) which were included in the survey.\r\n\r\nResults The receipt of government entitlement benefits by unemployed women is associated with a reduction of depression symptoms in the long term. Men and women not working and receiving means-tested or welfare benefits are more likely to report depression in both the short and long term.\r\n\r\nConclusions The study underscores the need for monitoring the impact of welfare reform on mental health.\r\n\r\n""",3
"b'The heterophile antigens Gal[alpha]1->3Gal and N-glycolylneuraminic acid are the major obstacle to grafting mammal organs, especially from pig, to man. Lack of expression of these common xenoantigens by birds has raised interest in ostrich as a potential organ donor for xenotransplantation. Glycosphingolipids of ostrich liver and kidney were investigated for their carbohydrate determinants. Both organs were found similar in their glycolipid composition with three major species, mono-, di-, and pentaglycosylceramide. The pentaglycosylceramide was characterized as the Forssman antigen. In both organs, the ceramide portion was highly hydroxylated with prevalence of [alpha]-hydroxylated fatty acids, C18 phytosphingosine in kidney and C18 sphingosine in liver Forssman glycolipid. These data indicate that hydroxylation of kidney glycosphingolipids, which is found in mammals, has been maintained since the divergence of birds from other vertebrates. Characterization of a minor glycolipid as a Forssman tetraglycosylceramide built on the galabiosylceramide core indicates that the Forssman tetraglycosylceramide also exists in vivo. Its precursors, galactosyl- and galabiosylceramide, were characterized in kidney and liver. The Forssman antigen is the third heterophile antigen against which man raises natural antibodies. Its localization in the vascular endothelium and connective tissue makes ostrich an unpromising organ or cell donor for xenotransplantation to man.'",2
"b'We present evidence that site-specific O-glycosylation by recombinant polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases rGalNAc-T2 and -T4 is controlled by the primary sequence context, as well as by the position and structure of previously introduced O-glycans. Synthetic mucin-type (glyco)peptides corresponding to sections of the tandem repeat regions of MUC1, MUC2, and MUC4 were used as substrates for recombinant polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, rGalNAc-T2 and -T4. By concerted and sequential action the two transferases are able to fully glycosylate MUC1 but only partially MUC2 and MUC4 tandem repeat peptides. GalNAc residues on MUC1 acceptor peptides trigger activity of rGalNAc-T4 directed to Ser in VTSA and Thr in PDTR and of rGalNAc-T2 to Ser/Thr within the GSTA motif of variant MUC1 peptides. However, elongation of GalNAc by \xdf3-galactosylation inhibits rGalNAc-T4 activity completely and rGalNAc-T2 activity with respect to the acceptor site GSTA. These findings are in accord with the inhibition of rGalNAc-T2 and -T4 by fully GalNAc-substituted MUC1 repeat peptide and support a glycosylation-dependent activity induction or enhancement of both enzymes.'",2

"b'Background Site-specific trend analysis is probably the most effective method available for assessing how the long-term trend in melanoma rates relates to changes in sun exposure and behaviour. New Zealand has very high incidence of and mortality from melanoma and the fraction of melanoma cases and deaths with a site specified has been comparatively high.\r\n\r\nMethods Trends in incidence and mortality from melanoma in New Zealand were analysed between 1969 and 1993, by sex and body site. A graphical representation of the trend by birth-cohort and age-period-cohort modelling were used.\r\n\r\nResults For all sites combined, the annual increase in incidence was 6.7% (95% CI : 6.3\x967.1%) in men and 3.1% (95% CI : 2.3\x963.7%) in women. The increase was significantly greater at each site for males. The largest increases occurred for the upper limbs in males (7.3% a year) and the trunk in females (3.8% a year). Incidence rates slowed appreciably in the later years (currently about 26/100 000 for each sex) and no further increase in lifetime risk of melanoma was observed among post World War II generations. Mortality trends paralleled those for incidence with a 25-year gap, with a more modest rate of increase (2\x963% per annum for each sex), essentially due to the increased risk among generations born up to 1919 or 1924. Age-standardized death rates have now stabilized in New Zealand at about 5.5/100 000 (men) and 3.2/100 000 (women). Trends between cohorts were the most marked for sites with a likely intermittent pattern of exposure, and were consistent overall for the trunk and the limbs.\r\n\r\nConclusions Results support the hypothesis that changes in lifestyle factors resulted in a pattern of carcinogenic exposures that explains both the upsurge in melanoma in the last few decades and the current levelling off in incidence.'",3
"b""Herein, the genetic control of regionalization and connectivity of the neocortex are reviewed. Evidence is accumulating which suggests that intrinsic mechanisms have a central role in controlling cortical regional specification and differentiation. Expression patterns of several genes (Id-2, Tbr-1, cadherin-6, cadherin-8, neuropilin-2, Wnt-7b, Eph-A7 and RZR-beta) are described; the expressions of these genes have regional boundaries which demarcate distint functional areas of the cerebral cortex in neonatal mice.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrate cerebral cortex, or pallium, is organized into several large functional subdivisions: the medial, dorsal, lateral and ventral pallium (L. Puelles et al., submitted for publication). In mammals, the medial pallium, or archicortex, includes the hippocampal and subicular regions; the dorsal pallium corresponds to the neocortex; the lateral pallium, or paleocortex, includes the primary olfactory cortex; and the ventral pallium includes the claustrum. Each of these regions has further subdivisions. For instance, within the neocortex, there are the prefrontal, motor and sensory regions, each with their own areal subdivisions. The extensive expansion of neocortical surface area and complexity in higher mammals (Northcutt and Kaas, 1995Go), especially in primates (Rakic, 1995Go), is probably causally related to the increased sophistication of higher cognitive processing of these species.\r\n\r\nWhat are the genetic and developmental processes that produce the diversity of cortical regions? Two schools of thought have made important contributions to this subject. The Protomap model (Rakic, 1988Go) postulates that neocortical regionalization is primarily controlled by molecular determinants that are intrinsic to the proliferative zone of the neocortex. These determinants control local regional identity and proliferative capacity (Dehay et al., 1993Go; Rakic, 1995Go; Polleux et al., 1997Go); radial migration of newborn neurons from the proliferative zone to the overlying differentiating cortex keeps the regional specification properties of the proliferative zone in register with the overlying cortical mantle (see Tan et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the Protomap model, the Protocortex model (O'Leary, 1989Go; Schlagger and O'Leary, 1991Go) suggests that neocortical regionalization is controlled in large part by extrinsic influences, such as thalamocortical axons or by the targets of cortical axons. Heterotopic transplantation experiments in rats provide evidence that ectopic immature cortical tissue can develop efferent projections and histology that are characteristics of the local cortical tissue (Stanfield and O'Leary, 1985Go; O'Leary and Stanfield, 1989Go; Schlagger and O'Leary, 1991Go). For instance, transplantation of late embryonic visual cortex into neonatal somatosensory cortex, results in the ectopic visual cortex to develop histological characteristics of the rat somatosensory cortex (barrels and associated boundary domains) (Schlagger and O'Leary, 1991Go). These results support the concept that neocortical sensory subdivisions in young animals have a high degree of functional plasticity. Furthermore, manipulations that alter the anatomy (ablation of whisker pads or ventrobasal thalamus) or that alter the function of the thalamic inputs to the rodent somatosensory cortex (e.g. mutations or pharmacological disruptions of monoamine oxidase, adenylate cyclase, serotonin levels, NMDA receptor), disrupt the development of the barrels (Killackey et al., 1995Go; Cases et al., 1996Go; Welker et al, 1996Go; Iwasato et al., 1997Go; Abdel-Majid et al., 1998Go). In addition, thalamic inputs are implicated in regulating the expression of the H-2Z1 transgene in the somatosensory cortex (Gitton et al., 1999aGo). These experiments show that anatomical and/or functional changes in axonal inputs to the neocortex can play a role in modifying existing, and generating new, neocortical subdivisions (Innocenti, 1995Go; Krubitzer, 1995Go).\r\n\r\nWhile the axonal inputs may regulate region-specific features of the postnatal rodent brain, we are unaware of evidence that afferent fibers regulate prenatal cortical development. Furthermore, several experiments suggest that some aspects of early cortical regionalization do not require extrinsic influences. For instance, transplantation and explant culture methods have provided evidence that the expression of regional molecular markers of the neocortex (Cohen-Tannoudji et al., 1994Go; Nothias et al., 1998Go; Gitton et al., 1999bGo) and lateral limbic cortex (Barbe et al ., 1991; Levitt et al., 1997Go; Arimatsu et al., 1999Go) do not depend upon extrinsic factors. In addition, several genes are regionally expressed in the cerebral cortex before thalamic input has penetrated the cortical plate (Arimatsu et al., 1992Go; Bulfone et al., 1995Go), as exemplified by the discontinuous expression of Tbr-1 in the mouse superficial cortical plate at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) (Bulfone et al., 1995Go).\r\n\r\nA definite answer regarding the role of extrinsic factors on cortical regionalization will likely require experimental methods to prevent the cortex from communicating with other brain regions. Such an approach has already been used (Wise and Jones, 1978Go); these authors performed a thalamotomy in newborn rats and found that a histological characteristic of layer IV (dense granule cell aggregates) in the somatosensory cortex was maintained. More recently, we have studied neocortical regionalization in Gbx-2 mutant mice (Wasserman et al., 1998) that lack thalamocortical fibers (Miyashita-Lin et al., unpublished data). Gbx-2 is a homeobox gene that is expressed in the developing thalamus and is required for its proper differentiation (Bulfone et al., 1993Go) (E.M. Miyashita-Lin et al., unpublished data). Because these mice die on the day of birth, probably due to brainstem abnormalities (Wasserman et al ., 1998), we have had to identify a panel of molecular markers that are regionally expressed in the cortex of neonatal mice. Herein, we describe several genes that are expressed in distinct subdivisions of the mouse cerebral cortex. In the Discussion, we address potential mechanisms intrinsic to the telencephalon that may regulate regionalization of the cerebral cortex. We end by addressing some genetic mechanisms that regulate the control of cortical axonal connectivity.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors represent major classes of glutamate receptors (GluR) which play fundamental roles in normal excitatory synaptic activity and, probably, in the etiology of several brain diseases. These receptors are composed of multiple receptor subunit proteins, and the differential expression of these subunits in cortical neurons is considered to be one of the substrates for the functional diversity of cortical excitatory circuitry. In the monkey neocortex, different subpopulations of neurons have been identified on the basis of immunocytochemical colocalization studies using subunit-specific antibodies, but no comparable investigations have been made in the human neocortex. The aim of the present study was to determine quantitatively GluR subunit combinations in the human temporal neocortex by double-labeling immunocyto- chemical experiments. We quantified the neuronal populations expressing different receptor subtypes with fluorescent tags visualizing them with confocal laser microscopy. We studied AMPA, kainate- and NMDA-receptor subunits, using antibodies against GluR1, GluR2, GluR2/3, GluR2/4, GluR5/6/7 and NMDAR1 subunits. A high degree of colocalization (93\x96100%) using combinations of antibodies against GluR2 with GluR2/3, GluR2/3 with GluR2/4, and GluR2 or GluR2/4 with NMDAR1 was found, whereas for other combinations the degree of colocalization varied between 38% and 88%. Some of the percentages reported here are similar to those found in the monkey cortex, whereas others differ considerably. These results emphasize the diversity of excitatory circuits in the human neocortex, and suggest species differences with regard to some of these GluR-mediated circuits.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a central role in human behavior. Anatomically connected with association areas of all sensory modalities, limbic structures, prefrontal cortical regions that mediate executive function and subcortical nuclei, this brain region can serve to integrate the physical and emotional attributes of a stimulusobject and establish a motivational value based on estimation of potential reward. To the extent that addictive disorders reflect a dysregulation of the ability to evaluate potential reward against harm from drug self-administration, it would be anticipated that substance abuse disorder might reflect dysfunction of the OFC. With the application of brain imaging techniques to the study of human substance abuse, evidence has been obtained that activity in the OFC and its connections plays a role in several components of the maladaptive behavior of substance abuse, including expectancy, craving and impaired decision making.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'Background This study examined the factors affecting mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) following the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake.\r\n\r\nMethods We examined the death certificates of all decedents between January 1994 and December 1996 in 16 municipalities, which covered most of the area affected by the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake. We analysed the extent and duration of the increased mortality from AMI. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of AMI was calculated weekly after the earthquake, taking the number of AMI deaths during the same period in 1994 as a reference. The main outcome measures were the number of deaths from AMI (ICD-9 410; ICD-10 I21, I22) in the study area before and after the earthquake, and the weekly SMR after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nResults A significant increase in mortality from AMI in the study area as a whole continued for about 8 weeks after the earthquake. There was wide variation amongst the regions with respect to the extent and duration of the increased mortality from AMI. The SMR of AMI showed a positive relationship with the percentage of houses which were completely destroyed, and was almost significant (r = 0.530, P = 0.062).\r\n\r\nConclusions The duration of increased cardiac mortality after the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake was longer than seen with previous earthquakes. Further analysis to identify the factors affecting cardiac mortality is needed so that we may reduce adverse health effects during the recovery stage following natural disaster.'",3
"b""A fundamental characteristic of working memory is that its capacity to handle information is limited. While there have been many brain mapping studies of working memory, the physiological basis of its capacity limitation has not been explained. We identified characteristics of working memory capacity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects. Working memory capacity was studied using a parametric `n-back' working memory task involving increasing cognitive load and ultimately decreasing task performance. Loci within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) evinced exclusively an `inverted-U' shaped neuro- physiological response from lowest to highest load, consistent with a capacity-constrained response. Regions outside of DLPFC, in contrast, were more heterogeneous in response and often showed early plateau or continuously increasing responses, which did not reflect capacity constraints. However, sporadic loci, including in the premotor cortex, thalamus and superior parietal lobule, also demon- strated putative capacity-constrained responses, perhaps arising as an upstream effect of DLPFC limitations or as part of a broader network-wide capacity limitation. These results demonstrate that regionally specific nodes within the working memory network are capacity-constrained in the physiological domain, providing a missing link in current explorations of the capacity characteristics of working memory.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'Stress has been reported to influence ethanol consumption and relapse in abstinent alcoholics. The present study examined if prolonged alterations in neurophysiological responses to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptides known to influence stress responses, would persist during protracted ethanol abstinence. Male Wistar rats were chronically exposed to ethanol vapour (EtOH group) or air (control group) for 6 weeks. Upon removal from the vapour chambers, recording electrodes were implanted in the cortex and amygdala. The effects of intracerebroventricular infusions of CRF and NPY on electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were then assessed 10\x9615 weeks after withdrawal from ethanol. Following abstinence from ethanol, the EtOH group displayed increased power in the 6\x968 Hz frequency range and increased stability in the cortical EEG. In addition, in the EtOH group the amplitude of the P2 ERP component in the frontal cortex was decreased and the latency of the P3 ERP component in the parietal cortex was delayed, compared to the control group during baseline recording conditions. The EtOH group was also more responsive to CRF and NPY. CRF significantly increased cortical power (6\x968 Hz) and increased cortical EEG stability in the EtOH group, compared to controls. Additionally, NPY significantly decreased the amplitude of the N1 ERP component in the amygdala of the EtOH group, but not in the control group. This enhanced sensitivity to CRF and NPY following chronic ethanol exposure and abstinence suggests that these peptidergic systems may play a role in the symptomatology of the prolonged abstinence syndrome.'",0
"b""Background Chronic illness and disability are of increasing public health importance but little is known about the lifetime influences involved in their onset and progression. We aim to (i) establish whether an individual's rating of limiting illness is stable over a 10-year period from age 23 to 33; (ii) assess the relationship between childhood and adult disability; and (iii) identify lifecourse influences on limiting illness in early adulthood.\r\n\r\nMethods Data were from the 1958 British birth cohort, including the original birth survey and follow-ups at ages 7, 11, 16, 23 and 33 years. Limiting longstanding illness was the outcome at both ages 23 and 33. Potential predictors included childhood health and physical development, socioeconomic conditions in early life and adulthood, and behavioural factors. We estimated the effect of potential explanatory factors using logistic regression, in both univariate and multivariate analyses, separately for limiting illness at 23 and 33 years.\r\n\r\nResults Prevalence of limiting illness increased from 5.1% (men) and 4.1% (women) at age 23 to 6% for both sexes at age 33. Risk of limiting illness at age 33 was greater for those reporting an illness at age 23 (29.4%, compared with 4.7% of those without illness), though the majority (66%) of 33-year limiting illnesses had no previous record at age 23 or for childhood. Multivariate analysis of limiting illness at age 23 confirmed the high risk for those with childhood disability and also established two further major predictors, namely, injury (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, 95% CI : 1.09\x961.86) and intermediate socio-emotional status (adjusted OR = 1.73, 95% CI : 1.29\x962.31). Additional risks were identified for limiting illness at age 33, including: (i) injury in the preceding 10 years (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI : 1.18\x962.04); (ii) body mass index (BMI), for which the relationship was non-linear, with elevated risks for the underweight (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI : 1.03\x962.26) and overweight (OR = 1.28, 95% CI : 0.87\x961.89); (iii) childhood disadvantage at either or both ages 7 and 11 (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI : 1.07\x962.17); and (iv) height at age 7, with a significant non-linear relationship (the adjusted OR for height less than 15th percentile was 1.43 and for height more than the 85th percentile, 1.30).\r\n\r\nConclusions Both childhood and adult factors predict limiting illness in early adulthood. Childhood is important because some adult illnesses originate in early life, and also because childhood environment influences the risk of adult limiting illness several years later. Our findings suggest that studies seeking to understand the causes of limiting illness, that currently tend to focus exclusively on contemporary factors, need also to consider the contribution of environment in early life.""",3
"b'To investigate the mechanism(s) whereby T cells protect against a lethal outcome of systemic infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, mice with targeted defects in genes central to T cell function were tested for resistance to i.v. infection with this virus. Our results show that mice lacking the capacity to secrete both IFN-{gamma} and perforin completely resisted disease. Similar results were obtained using IL-4 knockout mice, indicating that neither cell-mediated nor Th2-dependent effector systems were required. In contrast, mice deficient in expression of CD40 ligand were more susceptible than wild-type mice, and residual resistance in these mice was almost completely abrogated by depletion of CD8+ T cells. In keeping with this, mice lacking both MHC class I and class II expression succumbed to the infection, whereas most class II-deficient mice normally survive. Adoptive transfer experiments using B cell- and T cell-deficient recipients revealed that no protection could be obtained in the absence of B cells, whereas treatment with virus-specific immune (IgG) serum controlled viral spreading to the central nervous system (CNS), but did not necessarily accomplish virus elimination. Taken together, these results underscore that B cells are essential in preventing early infection of the CNS, but T cells are required for long-term survival. CD4+ T cells are most efficient in this context and the key function is to provide cognate help to B cells. However, if CD4+ cell function is compromised, CD8+ T cells become critical and may suffice for survival.'",4
"b""emale surgeons\x92 alcohol use: A Study of a Nation-wide Sample of Norwegian Doctors adds to the evidence that doctors are at increased risk of becoming dependent at some point in their career.\r\n\r\nThe finding that detrimental drinking by surgeons was more prevalent than might be expected may point to important fitness-to-practise considerations.\r\n\r\nThe questions \x91Who cares about doctors as individuals?\x92 and \x91Who cares for doctors apart from family and friends?\x92 seem still to be difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nA doctor's independence and ability to become immersed in a patient's plight are key components for effective medical practice.\r\n\r\nBecoming a doctor can be an isolating experience.\r\n\r\nMaintaining confidentiality, enabling others to cope with distress, dealing with uncertainty, and making decisions on the balance of probability, when each decision may have an impact on an individual patient's life, is the stuff of medicine, irrespective of age, experience, discipline, or specialty.\r\n\r\nDoctors are subject to an escalating compensation focus. Growing public acceptance of the conclusion that everything is predictable and, therefore, preventable, may be a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nHidden clinical morbidity in doctors is more likely because doctors seem to behave differently when it comes to their own health. The profession remains adept at self-diagnosis, self-prescribing, and not involving general practitioners. Doctors tend to adopt therapeutic roles for others when in treatment.\r\n\r\nThe insidious development of idiosyncratic practice which can be a consequence of ill health may be mediated by lack of support, escalating strain, inadequate training, or failing capacity and seems to be more likely when mutual respect within the profession is compromised.\r\n\r\nDeath by suicide is more likely than would be expected and the excess risk is linked to increased prevalence of mood disorder and substance misuse for doctors.\r\n\r\nData suggest that female doctors are up to three times more likely than would be expected to die by suicide. There may be significant differences between specialties with anaesthetists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners having higher vulnerability. Differences seem to be independent of seniority and time in the specialty (Hawton et al., 2000Go).\r\n\r\nThe misuse of alcohol and other drugs by doctors forms a major component of concerns about conduct, performance, and health within the medical profession. Those concerns often come to clinical attention because of media publicity. When substance misuse is evident, there is every indication that early intervention is therapeutic and would be preventative. Pervasive uncertainty on how to intervene persists (Fowlie, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Medical Association's (CMA) guide to physician's health and wellbeing highlights the need for culture and attitude change within the profession. There are widespread observations that medical training has neglected the topics of drug and alcohol misuse, and the importance of students' attitudes to alcohol (CMA, 2003Go).\r\n\r\nWithin the United Kingdom: The General Medical Council Health Review Group concluded that Government (in partnership with the profession) should take responsibility for the identification of affected doctors through the provision of effective, accessible arrangements for intervention, assessment, treatment, rehabilitation, and support (Hine, 2005Go).\r\n\r\nThe Medical Council on Alcohol established professional support as a component of its remit in 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Intercollegiate Group on Alcohol determined in 2005 that clinical assessment of clinicians merited attention and concluded that undergraduate and postgraduate education on dependence should be augmented by training on attitudes.\r\n\r\nCHITS (Clinicians' Health, Intervention, Treatment and Support) a confederation established in 2002 brought together the work of the Sick Doctors Trust, the Dentists, Pharmacists and Veterinary Surgeons Health Support Programmes, the British Medical Association's Doctors for Doctors Initiative (now incorporating the National Counselling Service for Sick Doctors). The Group acknowledged the work of local assessment and support programmes, forged links with the National Clinical Assessment Service, and has worked in sympathy with the Royal Colleges' initiatives on clinician support (Wilks and Freeman, CHITS, 2003Go).\r\n\r\nCHITS communications with the United Kingdom Health Departments have been augmented by a request to establish a network of assessment and treatment services dedicated to the special needs of clinical staff.\r\n\r\nThe CHITS group remains struck by the common association between detriment in clinical performance and clinicians' substance misuse.\r\n\r\nThe CHITS principles are consistent with the conclusions of the Misuse of Alcohol and Other Drugs by Doctors report and with the Standing Committee of European Doctors' statement on sick physicians with mental disorders, addiction behaviour, or both (Paimm, 2001Go). The group recognizes the benefits of local networks in supporting intervention, assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nCHITS has also proposed that student curricula identify attitudes and awareness, and deploy alcohol and drug use employment policies which are effective and readily utilized. CHITS has emphasized the importance of clinical staff not diagnosing and treating themselves, and not providing ad hoc opinions for colleagues. The group feels that information about national treatment and support services should be widely publicized.\r\n\r\nCHITS is extending its involvement with the Medical Council on Alcohol and with the Royal College of Psychiatrists Addiction Psychiatry Faculty. The group has also contributed to the Scottish Executive Health Department's proposals by emphasizing the need for active health assessment as a constant component to any investigation relating to fitness to practise (SEHD, 2004Go).\r\n\r\nMeantime, there is no universal system in the United Kingdom to identify and treat healthcare professionals with alcohol and drug problems. This lack may contribute to clinicians working until a very late stage is reached in their dependence cycle.\r\n\r\nThe CHITS initiative endorses the benefits of active intervention and emphasizes the importance of local links between Clinical Services, Occupational Health Services, Clinical Directorates, and Employing Authorities.\r\n\r\nAny reduction in the likelihood of developing alcohol dependence, coupled with effective access to assessment, treatment, rehabilitation, and support, both protects patient safety and limits the consequences of short- and long-term absence from work by individual clinicians.\r\n\r\nThe findings from this Norwegian study support the view that covert morbidity is widespread. Covert morbidity suggests that special measures to address health problems in clinical staff are required.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'mAb against human IL-5 inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia, tissue damage and airway hyper-reactivity in allergic animal models. Sch 55700 is a humanized, neutralizing anti-IL-5 antibody. To better understand the molecular mechanism by which Sch 55700 blocks IL-5 bioactivity, we have mapped its epitope by scanning IL-5 with synthetic peptides. Those peptides containing a region, ERRRV, corresponding to amino acids 89\x9693 of IL-5 specifically interact with both Sch 55700 and its parental rat IgG, 39D10. Among the five residues of this region, all three arginine residues were particularly critical for interaction of these peptides with Sch 55700. We further characterized this region by alanine scanning using site-directed mutagenesis. Examination of COS-expressed IL-5 mutants by Western blot showed that single mutations of E89, R90, R91 or R92 to alanine caused a loss of IL-5 binding to both Sch 55700 and 39D10. We further demonstrated in surface plasmon resonance studies using a BIAcore biosenosor that E89, R90 or R91 are involved in the interaction between IL-5 and its receptor {alpha} subunit. Based upon the findings here and previously reported structures of the IL-5 and 39D10 variable region, we propose a model suggesting that the molecular interactions between the IL-5 and Sch 55700 mainly involve several ion pair interactions. We conclude that Sch 55700 occupies a region, ERRR, on IL-5 that is essential for its interaction with the receptor and thereby blocks IL-5 bioactivity.'",4
"b'Brain factor-1 (BF-1) is a winged-helix (WH) transcription factor with a restricted pattern of expression in the neural tube. In the embryo, BF-1 is localized to the progenitor cells of the most rostral neural tube, the telencephalic neuroepithelium. Expression of BF-1 persists in the adult brain in the structures derived from the telencephalon, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the olfactory bulbs and the basal ganglia. Targeted disruption of the BF-1 gene in mice results in hypoplasia of the cerebral hemispheres. Proliferation of the telencephalic neuroepithelium is decreased and neuronal differentiation occurs prematurely. The forebrain of the BF-1 (\x96/\x96) mutant also displays dorsal\x96ventral patterning defects. Development of the ventral (basal) region of the telencephalon is more severely affected than the dorsal region. These anomalies are associated with the ectopic expression of BMP4 in the dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium and the loss of shh in the ventral telencephalon. These results raise the possibility that BF-1 may modulate both progenitor cell proliferation and regional patterning by regulating the expression or activity of inductive signals which act on the telencephalic neuroepithelium.\r\nThe ability of the brain to perform complex tasks depends both on the generation of large numbers of neurons during development and their organization into functional units. Groups of neurons can be characterized not only by their morphology and the neurotransmitters that they utilize but also by their position in the brain and their connections with other neurons. How does this complex structure arise from a simple sheet of neuroectoderm? Over the past decade, the discovery of a number of genes which are expressed in restricted patterns within the neural plate and neural tube has provided the tools to examine the molecular basis for the regional differentiation of the brain. Beginning with the formation of the three primary brain vesicles, the developing brain is functionally subdivided into progressively smaller regions. The cerebral cortex develops from the dorsal region of the telencephalon, which in turn derives from a rostral subdivision of the forebrain vesicle.\r\n\r\nThe neurons and glia of the central nervous system (CNS) arise from the neuroepithelium of the neural plate. The neuroepithelium is comprised of pluripotent progenitor cells, which serve as the stem cells of the CNS. One of the most striking manifestations of regional differentiation along the neural tube is the greater expansion of the rostral end of the neural tube to form the brain. Differences are also apparent in the growth of subregions of the brain (Tuckett and Morris-Kay, 1985Go; Schoenwolf and Alvarez, 1989Go). During evolution, the growth of the telencephalon has become progressively more prominent (Hofman 1989Go). This has resulted in the disproportionate growth of the cerebral hemispheres in mammals and especially in primates. The differential growth of the neural tube is largely dependent on the proliferation of the progenitor cells within each region (Dehay et al., 1993Go).\r\n\r\nEarly in development, neuroepithelial cells undergo symmetric cell divisions to give rise to daughter cells which continue to divide, thereby increasing the progenitor population. As development proceeds, the G1 phase of the cell cycle becomes progressively longer (Kaufman, 1968Go; Waechter and Jaensch, 1972Go; Hoshino et al., 1973Go), resulting in a slower rate of cell division. Secondly, the fraction of cells which withdraw from the cell cycle to initiate neuronal differentiation increases progressively. The size of the progenitor pool and hence the number of neurons generated from this pool depends both upon the number of cell divisions and the fraction of cells which exit the cell cycle after each mitosis (Caviness et al., 1995Go). The larger size and the greater number of neurons found in the cerebral hemispheres compared to other regions of the brain can be attributed primarily to a prolonged period of progenitor cell proliferation which permits additional cell divisions. Within the cerebral cortex and other laminar structures of the brain, the time of neuronal differentiation, i.e. the birthdate, also determines the laminar fate of the neuron (Bayer and Altman, 1987Go; McConnell, 1991Go). Thus the mechanisms which control progenitor cell proliferation and regulate their progression through the cell cycle are of central importance in the development of the brain.\r\n\r\nTremendous progress has been made in recent years in understanding the basic machinery of the cell cycle. For most cells, entry into S phase from G1 is the critical regulatory step which determines whether the cell will proliferate or undergo differentiation or apoptosis. G1 progression is controlled by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and phosphatases which modulate the phosphorylation state of Rb and related proteins. The activity of these components of the cell cycle machinery can be regulated by extracellular signals, including mitogens and growth inhibitors. Despite the advances in understanding the molecular components of the cell cycle, very little is known about the control of the cell cycle during vertebrate development.\r\n\r\nWe have investigated the function of a winged-helix (WH) transcription factor, brain factor-1 (BF-1), in the development of the brain. WH proteins are a family of putative transcriptional regulators which have diverse roles in development (Lai et al., 1993Go; Kaufman and Knochel, 1996Go). Members of this gene family were first identified in mammals as transcriptional activators of liver gene expression, the HNF-3 factors and in Drosophila as a nuclear protein, fkh, which was required for the development of head and tail structures in the embryo (Weigel et al., 1989Go; Lai et al., 1990Go, 1991Go). This gene family is characterized by a highly conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding domain, which, based on its structural features, was named the winged-helix domain (Clark et al., 1993Go). Over 100 members of this gene family have now been identified in eukaryotes. Sequence homology outside of the WH domain is limited to short motifs shared among subgroups of the gene family. The function of other domains of these proteins has been poorly characterized to date. Most WH genes are expressed in the embryo and have important functions during development. Targeted disruption of a growing number of WH genes in mice result in developmental defects, suggesting important roles for these genes in patterning and morphogenesis. In this article, we will review the studies which establish the essential role of BF-1 in the development of the cerebral hemispheres and discuss its potential role in regulating cell cycle progression in the telencephalic neuroepithelium.'",1
"b'We employed a genetic approach to study protein glycosylation in the procyclic form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Two different mutant parasites, ConA 1-1 and ConA 4-1, were isolated from mutagenized cultures by selecting cells which resisted killing or agglutination by concanavalin A. Both mutant cells show reduced concanavalin A binding. However, the mutants have different phenotypes, as indicated by the fact that ConA 1-1 binds to wheat germ agglutinin but ConA 4-1 and wild type do not. A blot probed with concanavalin A revealed that many proteins in both mutants lost the ability to bind this lectin, and the blots resembled one of wild type membrane proteins treated with PNGase F. This finding suggested that the mutants had altered asparagine-linked glycosylation. This conclusion was confirmed by studies on a flagellar protein (Fla1) and procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP). Structural analysis indicated that the N-glycan of wild type PARP is exclusively Man5GlcNAc2 whereas that in both mutants is predominantly a hybrid type with a terminal N-acetyllactosamine. The occupancy of the PARP glycosylation site in ConA 4-1 was much lower than that in ConA 1-1. These mutants will be useful for studying trypanosome glycosylation mechanisms and function.'",2
"b'Antibodies produced by an individual without a known history of sensitization to the relevant antigen are called \'natural"" antibodies. Some natural antibodies, called xenoreactive antibodies, react with the cells of foreign species. Most xenoreactive antibodies in humans and higher primates bind to a nonreducing terminal galactose expressed by pigs and other lower mammals. Although human natural antibodies which bind to one or more of a variety of terminal [alpha]-galactosylstructures have been identified previously, the antigen recognized by anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies on the cells of foreign species is thought to be exclusively Gal[alpha]1-3Gal. Thus, anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies which do not react with Gal[alpha]1-3Gal are thought to be nonxenoreactive. Here, we identify natural antibodies in human serum which bind to Gal[alpha]1-6Hexosepyrranosides but not Gal[alpha]1-3Gal, indicating that these antibodies are not xenoreactive. Various lowermammals were found to have natural anti-Gal[alpha]1-2Galantibodies in their sera, suggesting that at least some anti-Gal[alpha]1-2Gal antibodies might not be xenoreactive andindicating, surprisingly, that anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies are much more phylogenetically disperse than previously known. Also surprising was the finding that some natural antibodies which bind to Gal[alpha]1-3Gal in vitro do not bind to porcine xenografts. These studies show that naturally occurring anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies in mammalian serum include antibodies with a greater variety of reactivities than previously thought, only some of which would bind to a porcine xenograft. Further, these studies show that the methods used todetect anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies of relevance in xenotransplantation must be carefully evaluated to avoid detection of anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies which would not bind to a porcine organ and which therefore are not involved in xenograft rejection.'",2
"b'The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the cerebral activity pattern associated with auditory imagery for familiar tunes. Subjects either imagined the continuation of nonverbal tunes cued by their first few notes, listened to a short sequence of notes as a control task, or listened and then reimagined that short sequence. Subtraction of the activation in the control task from that in the real-tune imagery task revealed primarily right-sided activation in frontal and superior temporal regions, plus supplementary motor area (SMA). Isolating retrieval of the real tunes by subtracting activation in the reimagine task from that in the real-tune imagery task revealed activation primarily in right frontal areas and right superior temporal gyrus. Subtraction of activation in the control condition from that in the reimagine condition, intended to capture imagery of unfamiliar sequences, revealed activation in SMA, plus some left frontal regions. We conclude that areas of right auditory association cortex, together with right and left frontal cortices, are implicated in imagery for familiar tunes, in accord with previous behavioral, lesion and PET data. Retrieval from musical semantic memory is mediated by structures in the right frontal lobe, in contrast to results from previous studies implicating left frontal areas for all semantic retrieval. The SMA seems to be involved specifically in image generation, implicating a motor code in this process.'",1
"b'Adult visual cortex undergoes substantial functional change as a result of alterations in visual experience. Binocular retinal lesions lead to a reorganization of the visuotopic map in primary visual cortex. Associated with this change is a strengthening of an existing plexus of long-range horizontal connections by sprouting of axon collaterals and synaptogenesis. To explore the molecular substrate of this change, we studied the expression of potential factors involved in neural plasticity in the area of reorganization. We found elevation in a number of factors as early as 3 days following the lesion, including neurotrophins BDNF, NT3, NGF and the insulin-like growth factor IGF-1. Associated with the changes in neurotrophin levels was an elevation in their receptors. We also measured elevation of transcription factors, CaMKII, MAP2 and synapsins. These experiments provide evidence for a signal transduction cascade associated with cortical reorganization.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background Previous studies have demonstrated an association between physical inactivity and hypertension, but the methods used to assess activity have been subjective and imprecise. Recently methods have become available allowing measurement of energy expenditure in free-living populations. Our aim was to employ these methods to assess the independent association between energy expenditure, cardio-respiratory fitness and blood pressure.\r\n\r\nMethods In a cross-sectional study of 775 people (45\x9670 years) participating in a continuing population-based cohort study, energy expenditure was assessed by 4 days of heart rate monitoring with individual calibration of the relationship between heart rate and energy expenditure, a method validated against doubly-labelled water and whole body calorimetry. Cardio-respiratory fitness was assessed in a sub-maximal test. To adjust for measurement error in the assessment of usual energy expenditure and fitness, 190 subjects repeated both tests on three further occasions at 4-monthly intervals.\r\n\r\nResults A highly significant linear trend in blood pressure was found across quintiles of the physical activity level, the ratio of total energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate. The differences in the mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure between the top and bottom quintile was 6.3/4.4 mmHg in men and 10.7/5.9 mmHg in women. These effects were independent of obesity and cardio-respiratory fitness. Correction for measurement error suggests that the true underlying relationship between usual energy expenditure and blood pressure is stronger still.\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings are compatible with a strong association between usual energy expenditure and blood pressure and support public health strategies aimed at increasing overall energy expenditure.'",3
"b'A series of recordings in cat visual cortex suggest that synchronous activity in neuronal cell ensembles serves to bind the different perceptual qualities belonging to one object. We provide evidence that similar mechanisms seem also to be observable in human subjects for the representation of supramodal entities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 19 scalp electrodes (10/20 system) in 19 human subjects and EEG amplitude and coherence were determined during presentation of objects such as house, tree, ball. Objects were presented in three different ways: in a pictorial presentation, as spoken words and as written words. In order to find correlates of modality-independent processing, we searched for patterns of activation common to all three modalities of presentation. The common pattern turned out to be an increase of coherence between temporal and parietal electrodes in the 13\x9618 Hz beta1 frequency range. This is evidence that population activity of temporal cortex and parietal cortex shows enhanced coherence during presentation of semantic entities. Coherent activity in this low-frequency range might play a role for binding of multimodal ensembles.'",1
"b'We performed non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry in several areas that include both the association areas and the lower sensory areas of monkey cerebral cortex, and investigated the localization of neurons expressing two growth-associated proteins: GAP-43 and SCG10. Both GAP-43 and SCG10 mRNAs were observed in both pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons. Prominent hybridization signals for GAP-43 mRNA were observed in layers II\x96VI of the adult association areas: the prefrontal areas (FD), the temporal (TE) and the parietal (PG) association areas. The signals for GAP-43 mRNA were weak in layers I\x96III of the adult primary somatosensory area (PB) and primary (OC) and secondary (OB) visual areas, and cells with prominent signals were observed in layers IV\x96VI. The prominent signals for SCG10 mRNA were observed in layers IV\x96VI of all areas examined. These results suggest that the expression pattern of GAP-43 mRNA, but not that of SCG10 mRNA, may be related to the functional difference between association and lower sensory areas of adult cortex. In the infant cortex (postnatal days 2, 8 and 31), the signals for both mRNAs were intense in layers II\x96VI of all areas. Therefore, layer-specific expressions of GAP-43 and SCG10 mRNAs are established after the first postnatal month.'",1
"b'Background The anticarcinogenic and antiatherogenic properties of soy have been demonstrated in experimental studies. To evaluate the relationship between soy product intake and mortality from several types of cancer and heart disease, an ecological analysis was performed in 47 prefectures in Japan.\r\n\r\nMethods Age-standardized mortality rates for heart disease and stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer were obtained from the National Vital Statistics, 1995. Information on major nutrient and soy product intake was obtained from the National Nutritional Survey Report 1980\x961985. In this survey, dietary habits were surveyed annually by 3-day diet record in about 6000 randomly selected households.\r\n\r\nResults Soy protein intake was significantly correlated with stomach cancer mortality rate in men after controlling for total energy, alcohol and salt intake, and the mean age and proportion of current smokers in the prefecture (r = \x960.31, P = 0.04). Soy product intake estimated as total amount as well as isoflavone and soy protein intake were significantly positively correlated with colorectal cancer mortality rates in both sexes (for total amount, r = 0.32, P = 0.03 in men and r = 0.44, P = 0.001 in women) after controlling for covariates. The inverse correlation between soy product intake (as total amount or soy protein) and heart disease mortality rate was statistically significant in women after controlling for covariates (r = 0.32, P = 0.04 and r = \x960.31, P = 0.045, respectively).\r\n\r\nConclusion The present study provides modest support for the preventive role of soy against stomach cancer and heart disease death.'",3
"b'We present a comprehensive analysis of the cortical connections of the insular and adjacent cortical areas in the domestic cat by using microinjections of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. We examined the identity and extent of the cortical fields connected to each area, the relative anatomical weights of the various connections, their laminar origin, and their paths across the cerebral commissures. Our main finding is that despite their relatively small size and close apposition, the connections of the insular and adjacent areas are far more widespread and more specific to each area than previously realized, suggesting that each area is involved in disparate aspects of cortical integration. The granular insular area is linked to a constellation of somatosensory, motor, premotor and prefrontal districts. The dysgranular insular area is chiefly associated with lateral prefrontal and premotor, lateral somatosensory and perirhinal cortices. The dorsal agranular insular area is connected with limbic neocortical fields, while the ventral agranular insular area is associated with an array of olfactory allocortical fields. The anterior sylvian area is associated with visual, auditory and multimodal areas, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and with perirhinal area 36. The parainsular area is linked to non-tonotopic auditory and ventromedial frontal areas. Trajectories followed by the callosal axons of each of the investigated areas are extremely divergent. As a whole, the picture of the insular region that emerges from this and a parallel study (Clasc\xe1 et al., J Comp Neurol 384:456\x96482, 1997) is that of an extreme heterogeneity, both in terms of histological architecture and neural connections. Comparison with earlier published reports on primates suggests that most, but not all, of the areas we investigated in cats may have an direct counterpart within the insula of Old World monkeys.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background In Bahrain and other populations of the Arabian Peninsula, glucose intolerance is associated with raised plasma total cholesterol, postmenopausal status and low educational status. These associations are not generally seen in other populations with high diabetes prevalence. A study was undertaken in order to determine if hypertension in Bahrainis is associated with the same factors as those related to glucose intolerance.\r\n\r\nMethods A cross-sectional survey of 2120 Bahrainis aged 40\x9669 years.\r\n\r\nResults The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (defined as current treatment for hypertension, systolic blood pressure >=160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >=95 mmHg) rose with increasing degrees of glucose intolerance. Age- and sex-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 21% (95% CI : 19\x9624%) in those with normal glucose tolerance, 31% (95% CI : 27\x9636%) in those with impaired glucose tolerance, and 38% (95% CI : 34\x9642%) in those with diabetes. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for age and sex, raised blood pressure was independently associated with waist girth, plasma cholesterol, glucose intolerance, family history of hypertension and (in women) postmenopausal status. There was an inverse relationship between blood pressure and educational status that was independent of other variables. This association parallels the inverse relationship of diabetes to educational level and is consistent with low educational level being a marker for socioeconomic deprivation in early life in this population.\r\n\r\nConclusion The high prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes in Bahrainis are manifestations of a pattern of metabolic disturbances that includes raised plasma cholesterol levels. Both hypertension and diabetes are associated with low educational status, which in this population is a marker for socioeconomic deprivation in early life. This suggests that the risk of hypertension may be set by environmental factors in early life'",3
"b'Background This case-control study was conducted to estimate the renal cell cancer (RCC) risk for exposure to occupation-related agents, besides other suspected risk factors.\r\n\r\nMethods In a population-based multicentre study, 935 incident RCC cases and 4298 controls matched for region, sex, and age were interviewed between 1991 and 1995 for their occupational history and lifestyle habits. Agent-specific exposure was expert-rated with two job-exposure matrices and a job task-exposure matrix. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate smoking adjusted odds ratios (OR).\r\n\r\nResults Very long exposures in the chemical, rubber, and printing industries were associated with risk for RCC. Males considered as \x91substantially exposed to organic solvents\x92 showed a significant excess risk (OR = 1.6, 95% CI : 1.1\x962.3). In females substantial exposure to solvents was also a significant risk factor (OR = 2.1, 95% CI : 1.0\x964.4). Excess risks were shown for high exposure to cadmium (OR = 1.4, 95% CI : 1.1\x961.8, in men, OR = 2.5, 95% CI : 1.2\x965.3 in women), for substantial exposure to lead (OR = 1.5, 95% CI : 1.0\x962.3, in men, OR = 2.6, 95% CI : 1.2\x965.5, in women) and to solder fumes (OR = 1.5, 95% CI : 1.0\x962.4, in men). In females, an excess risk for the task \x91soldering, welding, milling\x92 was found (OR = 3.0, 95% CI : 1.1\x967.8). Exposure to paints, mineral oils, cutting fluids, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and asbestos showed an association with RCC development.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our results indicate that substantial exposure to metals and solvents may be nephrocarcinogenic. There is evidence for a gender-specific susceptibility of the kidneys.'",3
"b'Human CD4 T cells can be divided into two functionally distinct subsets: a CD45RO+ memory subset and a CD45RA+ naive subset. In an attempt to identify novel cell surface molecules on these cells, we have developed a mAb, anti-1D4. The antigen defined by anti-1D4 was preferentially expressed on the memory subset of freshly isolated peripheral CD4 T cells and 1D4+ CD4 T cells functionally corresponded to memory T cells. Retrovirus-mediated expression cloning revealed that the 1D4 antigen is human CD43. Transfection of CHO-leu cells, which stably express human CD43, with core 2 \xdf-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) conferred expression of the 1D4 antigen and mRNA of C2GnT was detected by RT-PCR only in 1D4+ T cells but not in 1D4\x96 T cells, implying that the 1D4 antigen is composed of core 2-containing O-glycans on CD43. Reactivity with anti-1D4 was completely abolished when cells were treated with neuraminidase, while there remained weak binding of anti-T305, a previously described mAb which also reacts with CD43 modified with core 2-containing O-glycans. Moreover, anti-1D4 markedly reacted with NIH-3T3 cells expressing human CD43 and low levels of endogenous C2GnT, whereas anti-T305 reacted slightly. These results indicate that the 1D4 antigen is distinct from the epitope defined by anti-T305 and anti-1D4 is a more sensitive probe to detect core 2-containing O-glycans than anti-T305. Taken together, our results indicate that core 2-containing O-glycans, whose expression can easily be detected with anti-1D4, are preferentially expressed in the CD45RO+ memory subset of CD4 T cells.'",4
"b'The biochemical hallmark of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) including type Ia is a defective N-glycosylation of serum glycoproteins. Hypoglycosylated forms of {alpha}1-antitrypsin have been detected by Western blot in serum from CDG Ia patients. In contrast we were not able to detect hypoglycosylation in {alpha}1-antitrypsin synthesized by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, enterocytes, and leukocytes. Similarly no hypoglycosylation was detectable in a membrane-associated N-linked glycoprotein, the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT-1 and also in serum immunoglobulin G isolated from sera of CDG Ia patients. We conclude that the phenotypic expression of CDG Ia is tissue-dependent.'",2
"b'The present study attempts to identify specific genetic loci contributing to experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) susceptibility in F2 progeny of resistant Fischer (F344/N) and susceptible Lewis (LEW/N) inbred rats. F2 progeny of F344/N x LEW/N inbred rats were immunized with the R16 peptide of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). A genome-wide scan was conducted using 125 simple sequence length polymorphism markers in selected F2 animals that developed severe eye disease or remained unaffected to identify phenotype:genotype co-segregation. The F2 population (n = 1287) demonstrated a wide range of histologically assessed EAU scores (assessed on a scale of 0\x964). The disease incidence and severity were not consistent with a simple Mendelian inheritance model. Of the F2 hybrid rats, 60% developed EAU, implying the existence of a potent susceptibility locus with incomplete penetrance associated with the LEW genome or a more complex polygenic model of inheritance. Two genomic regions, on chromosomes 4 and 12, showed strong genetic linkage to the EAU phenotype (P < 0.0016), suggesting the presence of susceptibility loci in these chromosomal regions. In conclusion, we have identified two genomic candidate intervals from D4Arb8 to D4Mit17 on chromosome 4 and from the chromosome end to D12Arb8 on chromosome 12, that appear to influence EAU susceptibility in LEW/F344 rats. Further analysis of these genomic regions may lead to identification of the susceptibility genes and to characterization of their function.'",4
"b'The MHC class II molecule I-Ag7 is essential for the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse but the requirements for peptide binding to I-Ag7 are still controversial. We have now isolated I-Ag7-binding phage from a large phage display library encoding random nonamer peptides. Ninety peptide-encoding regions of phage eluted from I-Ag7 were sequenced and >75% of the corresponding synthetic peptides bound to I-Ag7. Peptide alignment led to the identification of position-specific anchor residues. Hydrophobic (V and P) and positively charged (K) residues were highly enriched at P6 and positively charged (R and K), aromatic (Y) or hydrophobic (L) residues at P9. In addition, small amino acid residues (G and A) were enriched at P7 and G at P8. The primary anchors at P6 and P9 defining the phage-derived motif were present in most high-affinity I-Ag7-binding peptides from IDDM candidate antigens but only in <=25% of peptides that were low-affinity binders or failed to bind to I-Ag7. A comparison of these results with the proposed motifs for peptide binding to I-Ag7 validates the one we have previously described.'",4
"b'CTLA-4 (CD152) is transiently induced on the cell surface of activated T cells and expression is limited at a low level. In this study, we investigated the possibility that phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3-K) and other related PI kinases associated with the cytoplasmic domain of CTLA-4 are involved in intracellular trafficking and sorting of CTLA-4 protein. Treatment with micromolar concentrations of wortmannin (WN) for >4 h enhanced both cell-surface and intracellular CTLA-4 without affecting its transcriptional activities in a murine mastocytoma cell line transfected with the human CTLA-4 gene and normal activated CD4+ T cells. However, a more specific PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002, failed to affect CTLA-4 expression, indicating that the action of WN is independent of conventional PI 3-K activities. WN down-regulated specific association of CTLA-4 with adaptor proteins and its endocytosis. The fact that lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride and monensin, enhanced CTLA-4 expression suggests that WN may also block lysosomal sorting and consequent degradation of CTLA-4. Co-localization of CTLA-4 and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 detected by immunofluorescence microscopy indicates the actual lysosomal sorting of CTLA-4. Our data suggest the existence of WN-sensitive enzymes, which promote lysosomal sorting of CTLA-4. In addition to rapid endocytosis by clathrin-associated adaptor complex, a prompt sorting of CTLA-4 to lysosomes may be one of the regulatory mechanisms for managing CTLA-4 signals in intracellular trafficking pathways.'",4
"b'We previously reported that GalCer expression factor 1 (GEF-1), a rat homologue of hepatocyte growth factor\x96regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), induced GalCer expression, morphological changes, and cell growth inhibition in COS-7 cells. In this study, we describe the characterization of GEF-1 in MDCK cells. Overexpression of GEF-1 in MDCK (MDCK/GEF-1) cells showed GalCer-derived sulfatide expression as well as dramatic morphological changes, but not cell growth suppression. The enzyme activity and the mRNA level of UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT) increased significantly in MDCK/GEF-1 cells compared with control cells. GEF-1 molecule is composed of four domains; a zinc-finger (Z), a proline-rich (P), a coiled-coil (C), and a proline/glutamine-rich (Q) domain. MDCK cells transfected with various GEF-1 deletion mutants were examined for morphology and for glycolipid expression. MDCK cells transfected with Z-domain deletion mutant (MDCK/PCQ) and those with both Z- and P-domains deletion mutant (MDCK/CQ) were similar to those with a wild-type GEF-1 (MDCK/ZPCQ) in shape, exhibiting fibroblast-like cells, whereas those with the other deletion mutants showed no morphological changes, exhibiting typical epithelial-like cells. On the other hand, MDCK/ZPCQ, MDCK/PCQ, MDCK/CQ, and MDCK/Q cells expressed sulfatide, whereas those with the other deletion mutants that did not include the Q-domain showed neither GalCer nor sulfatide expression. Thus, the correlation between fibroblast-like cells in shape and the glycolipid expression was good in these deletion mutants except MDCK/Q cells, which showed epithelial-like cells, but expressed sulfatide. The glycolipid expression paralleled CGT mRNA levels. Taking these results together, it is suggested that only the Q-domain may be essential for the role of GEF-1 in inducing CGT mRNA, whereas the Q-domain together with the C-domain may be required for the induction of morphological changes in MDCK cells.'",2
"b'In the present work we discuss several sampling procedures commonly used for counting synapses in the cerebral cortex. We compare, within the same tissue, two frequently used sterereological methods for determining the numerical density of synapses per unit volume, using as an example the estimation of the number of types of synapses by layers in the neuropil of the adult human temporal neocortex. These two methods are a size\x96frequency method (formula NA/d) and the disector method ({Sigma}Q\x96/a x h). Since the size\x96frequency method is assumption-based and the disector method is considered to be an unbiased method, the latter is often recommended for the quantification of synapses and other objects. We obtained, however, similar estimates for the numerical density of the different types of synapses using both methods, although they presented different technical difficulties and statistical properties. In addition, we show that the size\x96frequency method is more efficient and easier to apply than the disector method. Nevertheless, there are other methods for quantification which may also be valid, depending on the aim of the research; but the data reported in many articles are often complicated, which makes it very difficult for the reader to follow all the steps of the calculation. If certain basic information were given, this would facilitate the interpretation and sharing of important information with other laboratories, regardless of the method used for quantification. Finally, based on our present results and previous literature, we propose a simple general protocol for estimating the numerical synaptic density by volume in the neuropil of the cerebral cortex.'",1
"b'Precise regulation of MHC class II expression plays a crucial role in the control of the immune response. The transactivator CIITA behaves as a master controller of constitutive and inducible MHC class II gene activation, but its exact mechanism of action is not known. Activation of MHC class II promoters requires binding of at least three distinct multi-protein complexes (RFX, X2BP and NF-Y). It is known that the stability of this binding results from cooperative interactions between these proteins. We show here that expression of CIITA in MHC class II\x96 cells triggers occupation of the promoters by these complexes. This observation raised the possibility that the effect of CIITA on promoter occupation is mediated by an effect on the cooperative stabilization of the DNA-bound multi-protein complexes. We show, however, that the presence of CIITA does not affect the stability of the higher-order protein complex formed on DNA by RFX, X2BP and NF-Y. This suggests other mechanisms for CIITA-induced promoter occupancy, such as an effect on chromatin structure leading to increased accessibility of MHC class II promoters. This ability of CIITA to facilitate promoter occupation is undissociable from its transactivation potential. Finally, we conclude that this effect of CIITA is cell-type specific, since expression of CIITA is not required for normal occupation of MHC class II promoters in B lymphocytes.'",4
"b'Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are plasma membrane components of every eukaryotic cell. They are composed of a hydrophobic ceramide moiety linked to a glycan chain of variable length and structure. Once thought to be relatively inert, GSLs have now been implicated in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies of animals rendered genetically deficient in various classes of GSLs have demonstrated that these molecules are important for embryonic differentiation and development as well as central nervous system function. A family of extremely severe diseases is caused by inherited defects in the lysosomal degradation pathway of GSLs. In many of these disorders GSLs accumulate in cells, particularly neurons, causing neurodegeneration and a shortened life span. No effective treatment exists for most of these diseases and little is understood about the mechanisms of pathogenesis. This review will discuss the development of a new approach to the treatment of GSL storage disorders that targets the major synthesis pathway of GSLs to stem their cellular accumulation.'",2
"b'Background The study cohort of the survivors of the A-bombs in Japan, used as the basis of the internationally accepted estimates of cancer radiation risk, was collected more than 5 years after the bombing and did not include those who died of bomb-related injuries before that date. This paper tests whether the people who survived, in spite of bomb-related injuries, are homogeneous in respect of variation of cancer risk with age with survivors without such injuries.\r\n\r\nMethods Appropriate statistical models are derived and fitted to survivor data by maximum likelihood and the resultant statistics used to test the homogeneity assumption.\r\n\r\nResults Significant differences were found between those with no injuries and those with multiple injuries and shown to be largely due to exposures before 10 or after 55 years of age having exceptionally high risks of late effects of radiation for survivors showing early effects, i.e. bomb-related injuries.\r\n\r\nConclusions Certain accepted dogmas about the biology of radiation risks in humans, such as \x91cancer is the only late effect of radiation\x92 and \x91leukaemia is uniquely radiogenic amongst cancers\x92, may be significantly in error. These are discussed.'",3
"b'Background We enrolled a cohort of primary schoolchildren with a history of wheeze (n = 148) in an 11-month longitudinal study to examine the relationship between ambient ozone concentrations and peak expiratory flow rate.\r\n\r\nMethods Enrolled children recorded peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) twice daily. We obtained air pollution, meteorological and pollen data. In all, 125 children remained in the final analysis.\r\n\r\nResults We found a significant negative association between daily mean deviation in PEFR and same-day mean daytime ozone concentration (\xdf-coefficient = 0.88; P = 0.04) after adjusting for co-pollutants, time trend, meteorological variables, pollen count and Alternaria count. The association was stronger in a subgroup of children with bronchial hyperreactivity and a doctor diagnosis of asthma (\xdf-coefficient = \x962.61; P = 0.001). There was no significant association between PEFR and same-day daily daytime maximum ozone concentration. We also demonstrated a dose-response relationship with mean daytime ozone concentration.\r\n\r\nConclusions Moderate levels of ambient ozone have an adverse health effect on children with a history of wheezing, and this effect is larger in children with bronchial hyperreactivity and a doctor diagnosis of asthma.'",3
"b'Converging evidence supports a role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in barrel cortex development. Systemic administration of 5-HT-depleting drugs reduces cross-sectional whisker barrel areas in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) of neonatal rats. Here we assess the relative impact on barrel pattern formation of (i) 5-HT depletion and (ii) decreased brain growth, which is often associated with pharmacological 5-HT depletion, by comparing the effects of 5-HT-depleting drugs with those of reduced protein intake. Left hemisphere 5-HT levels in the SSC and right hemisphere whisker barrel areas were assessed at postnatal day 6 (P6) in the same animal following injection of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) at P0. Both drugs significantly reduced cortical 5-HT content and mean barrel areas at P6, but also body and brain growth. Differences in brain weight accounted for 84.4% of the variance in barrel size, with negligible contributions by cortical 5-HT content. PCPA-treated animals sacrificed at P14 yielded similar trends, albeit less pronounced. Finally, reduced protein intake resulted in lower body weight and cortical 5-HT levels at P6, but yielded no change in brain weight or mean barrel area. Barrel formation therefore appears markedly less sensitive to 5-HT depletion per se than to drug-induced growth impairment.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Data are presented from a screening study of ambulant attendees at two London Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments. Among young people (aged 16\x9624 years), 37.2% were drinking harmfully [an Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 or more]; 17.3% admitted to drinking alcohol in the 6 h prior to attendance; and 14.6% considered that their attendance was alcohol related. Young women were as likely as men to score 8 or over. This age group had nearly twice the odds of scoring highly on the AUDIT, compared to those over 25 years old, and were more likely to report that their attendance was alcohol related. Screening in A&E departments would identify considerable numbers of young people who might benefit from brief intervention, but the problems of doing so are acknowledged.'",0
"b'Our previous studies have shown extensively diverse structures in oligo/polymers of sialic acid (oligo/polySia) that are expressed often in developmentally regulated manner on animal glycoconjugates. The aim of this study was to establish highlysensitive and specific methods that can be used to identify diverse types of oligo/polySia and thus can be applied to studies of biological phenomena associated with the differential expression of oligo/polySia chains with different degree of polymerization (DP). As model compounds, we analyzedfive different homologous series of oligo/polySia, (->8Neu5Ac[alpha]2->)n, (->9Neu 5Ac[alpha]2->)n, (->8Neu5Gc[alpha]2->)n, (->5-Oglycolyl-Neu5Gc[alpha]2->)n, and Neu5Gc9SO4 [alpha]2->(->5-Oglycolyl-Neu5Gc[alpha]2->)n, expressed in various biopolymers. The latter two structures have recently been identified in sea urchin egg receptor for sperm. First we examined application of high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a CarboPac PA-100 column with pulsed electrochemical detection (PED) to new types of oligo/polySiacompounds and confirmed that resolution of high polymers (DP > 70) of sialic acids was remarkable as reported previously. However, there are limitations in sensitivity and selectivity in PED that become significant when material is available only in a minute amount or material contained a large proportion of protein. These limitations can be circumvented by fluorometric detection of oligo/polySia tagged with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methyl-enedioxybenzene (DMB) at the reducing terminal residues after separation on a MonoQ HR5/5 column. The latter method can be applied to any type of oligo/polySia we examined if we choose the derivatization conditions and is more sensitive and specific than the method with PED for analysis of oligo/polySia with DP up to 25.'",2

"b'Glycoproteins on the cell surface of Trypanosoma cruzi are known to play important roles in the interaction of the parasite with the host cells. We previously determined the structures of the O-glycan chains from the sialoglycoproteins (mucin-like molecules) of the G- and Y-strains and observed significant differences between them. We now report the structures of the sialylated and nonsialylated O-linked oligosaccharides isolated from the cell surface glycoproteins of the myotropic CL-Brener strain grown in the presence of fetal calf serum. The structures of the O-linked oligosaccharide alditols obtained by reductive \xdf-elimination of the sialoglycoprotein were determined by a combination of methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment\x96mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

"b'Background The role of diarrhoea in the aetiology of growth retardation in young children remains controversial. To evaluate this, a population-based, longitudinal study of young children aged 6\x9648 months was conducted in Matlab, a rural area of Bangladesh, between May 1988 and April 1989.\r\n\r\nMethods Data obtained from 584 children were examined by one-year (n = 412) and 3-month (n = 1220) growth periods. Each growth period was analysed based on clinical types of diarrhoea, namely, non-diarrhoea, non-dysentery diarrhoea (diarrhoea without blood), and dysentery (diarrhoea with blood). Weight and height gains were compared among the study groups initially by one-way analysis of variance followed by multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables.\r\n\r\nResults Compared to non-diarrhoea and non-dysentery diarrhoea, dysentery was associated with significantly lower annual weight gain (1866 g [P < 0.01] and 1550 g [P < 0.05] versus 1350 g, respectively) and height gain (6.51 cm and 5.87 cm versus 5.27 cm [P < 0.01], respectively). Both 3-month dysentery and non-dysentery intervals were significantly associated with less weight gain compared to non-diarrhoea intervals (490 g and 522 g versus 637 g [P < 0.05], respectively). Dysentery intervals were also associated with significantly poorer height gain compared to other intervals (2.19 cm versus 2.42 cm [P < 0.05] and 2.46 cm [P < 0.01], respectively).\r\n\r\nConclusions The growth of young children is strongly influenced by the clinical type of diarrhoea and the impact is dependent on the proportion of dysentery episodes in the total diarrhoeal burden.'",3
"b'Background We examined the association between prosperity and traffic accident mortality in the industrialized world in a long-term perspective.\r\n\r\nMethods We calculated traffic accident mortality, traffic mobility and the fatal injury rate of 21 industrialized countries from 1962 until 1990. We used mortality and population data of the World Health Organization (WHO), and figures on motor vehicle ownership of the International Road Federation (IRF). We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of these traffic-related variables with the prosperity level per country, derived from data of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\r\n\r\nResults We found a reversal from a positive relation between prosperity and traffic accident mortality in the 1960s to a negative association currently. At a certain level of prosperity, the growth rate of traffic mobility decelerates and the fatal injury rate continues to decline at a similar rate to earlier phases.\r\n\r\nConclusions In a long-term perspective, the relation between prosperity and traffic accident mortality appears to be non-linear: economic development first leads to a growing number of traffic-related deaths, but later becomes protective. Prosperity growth is not only associated with growing numbers of motor vehicles in the population, but also seems to stimulate adaptation mechanisms, such as improvements in the traffic infrastructure and trauma care.'",3
"b""CD147 is a broadly expressed cell surface glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily whose expression is up-regulated upon T cell activation. In order to elucidate a possible role of CD147 in T cell biology, we established 15 specific mAb. Seven distinct epitopes were defined by the mAb panel. Most of the mAb bound only to phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated but not resting T cells. We demonstrate that this was not because of true expression of activation-dependent neoepitopes but rather due to bivalent binding of the relatively low-affinity mAb (affinity constant KA values between 2.25 x 108 and 7 x 109 M\x961) to the more densely expressed and/or more clustered CD147 molecules on the activated T cells. In contrast, the mAb with higher affinity (KA > 7 x 109 M\x961) could stably bind in a monovalent fashion even to the relatively low dense CD147 molecules on resting T cells. This model might more generally explain the nature of `activation epitopes' described previously in other leukocyte surface molecules. Finally, we provide evidence that induction of ordered dimerization of CD147 by a mAb directed to a unique epitope results in strong inhibition of CD3-mediated T cell activation.""",4
"b'Background Children of Sardinian heritage are at high risk of type 1 diabetes, whereas no data are available in young adults. Age at onset of type 1 diabetes could be associated with different relative weight of genetic susceptibility and environmental determinants in the pathogenesis of the disease. We test this hypothesis in subjects with Sardinian heritage 0\x9629 years of age living in the city of Turin, a highly industrialized area in Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nMethods In all, 202 cases with onset of type 1 diabetes aged 0\x9629 years during 1984\x961991 and 1010 controls randomly selected from residents of the city of Turin, frequency-matched by sex and year of birth to cases, were included in this study. Name and place of birth of parents were ascertained by postal inquiry and linkage with city population and census files. Social class was based on the highest educational level of parents abstracted from 1991 and 1981 census files.\r\n\r\nResults Differential effects on risk of type 1 diabetes of Sardinian heritage and social class in the age groups 0\x9614 and 15\x9629 years were found. In children with one and both Sardinian parents the odds ratios (OR) were 2.09 (95% CI : 0.85\x965.15) and 3.20 (95% CI : 0.75\x9613.64); in young adults 0.81 (95% CI : 0.18\x963.64) and 1.95 (95% CI : 0.51\x967.40), respectively. In subjects with low social class the OR were 1.16 (95% CI : 0.68\x961.97) in children and 0.66 (95% CI : 0.41\x961.05) in young adults.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study shows higher risk of type 1 diabetes in subjects of Sardinian heritage; higher risk in children than in young adults and a protective effect of low social class in young adults. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of heterogeneity of type 1 diabetes by age at onset, with prevailing genetic effect in childhood and environmental determinants in adulthood.'",3
"b'Background No previous study has provided national estimates of the prevalence of primary and secondary infertility in sizeable areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\r\n\r\nMethods Primary infertility is measured by the proportion childless among women who entered their first marriage at least 7 years before date of censoring. Secondary infertility is measured by the \x91subsequently infertile estimator\x92 from parous ever-married women. Exposure begins at the age of the woman at the birth of her first child, and exposure ends when the woman is of an age, which is 5 years lower than her age at censoring. These last 5 years are used to determine her status as infertile or fertile at the last observation 5 years before censoring. A woman is considered infertile at last observation if she has had no livebirths during the last 5 years before censoring, otherwise she is considered fertile. A woman who has not given birth at age a or later is defined as being \x91infertile subsequent to age a\x92. The index of the proportion subsequently infertile at age a is estimated as the number of women infertile subsequent to age a, divided by the total number of women observed at that age. Infertility is estimated for women age 20\x9644.\r\n\r\nResults Primary infertility is relatively low and it exceeds 3% in less than a third of the 28 African countries analysed. In contrast, elevated levels of secondary infertility prevail in most countries. Secondary infertility for women age 20\x9644 ranges from 5% in Togo to 23% in Central African Republic.\r\n\r\nConclusions It is feasible to gauge national levels of primary and secondary infertility from population based surveys including a birth history. The prevalence of infertility of pathological origin is so high in sub-Saharan Africa that infertility is not merely an individual concern, it is a public health problem.'",3
"b'NF-{kappa}B is a potent cellular activator of HIV-1 gene expression. Down-regulation of NF-{kappa}B activation is known to inhibit HIV replication from the latently infected cells. Gold compounds have been effectively used for many decades in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We previously reported that gold compounds, especially aurothioglucose (AuTG) containing monovalent gold ion, inhibited the DNA-binding of NF-{kappa}B in vitro. In this report we have examined the efficacy of the gold compound AuTG as an inhibitor of HIV replication in latently infected OM10.1 and Ach2 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha}-induced HIV-1 replication in OM10.1 or Ach2 cells was significantly inhibited by non-cytotoxic doses of AuTG (>10 \xb5M in OM10.1 cells and >25 \xb5M in Ach2 cells), while 25 \xb5M of the counter-anion thioglucose (TG) or gold compound containing divalent gold ion, HAuCl3, had no effect. The effect of AuTG on NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression was confirmed by a transient CAT assay. Specific staining as well as electron microscopic examinations revealed the accumulation of metal gold in the cells, supporting our previous hypothesis that gold ions could block NF-{kappa}B\x96DNA binding by a redox mechanism.

We tested monkeys with unilateral lesions of these areas on a visual working memory task in which motion signals not only had to be encoded, but also stored for brief periods of time and then retrieved. The monkeys compared the directions of motion of two random-dot stimuli, sample and test, separated by a temporal delay. By increasing the temporal delay and spatially separating the two stimuli, placing one in the affected visual field and the other in the intact visual field, we were able to assess the contribution of MT/MST to specific components of the task: encoding (sample), retention (delay) and encoding/retrieval/comparison (test). We found that the effects of MT/MST lesions on specific components depended upon the demands of the task and the nature of the visual motion stimuli. Whenever stimuli consisted of random dots moving in a broad range of directions, MT/MST lesions appeared to affect encoding. Furthermore, when the lesions affected encoding of the sample, retention of the direction of stimulus motion was also affected. However, when the stimulus was coherent and the emphasis of the task was on the comparison of small direction differences, the absence of MT/MST had major impact on the retrieval/comparison component of the task and not on encoding or storage.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Sanfilippo syndrome type III A (Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III A) is a rare, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease, characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate and the loss of function of lysosomal heparan N-sulfatase activity. The disease leads to devastating mental and physical consequences and a mouse model that can be used to explore gene therapy and enzyme or cell replacement therapies is needed. We have previously identified a mouse with low sulfamidase activity and symptoms and pathologies typical of MPS III A (Bhaumik, M., Muller, V. J., Rozaklis, T., Johnson, L., Dobrenis, K., Bhattacharyya, R., Wurzelmann, S., Finamore, P., Hopwood, J. J., Walkley, S. U., and Stanley, P. [1999] A mouse model for mucopolysaccharidosis type III A (Sanfilippo syndrome). Glycobiology 9, 1389\x961396). We now show that the sulfamidase gene of the MPS III A mouse carries a novel mutation (G91A) that gives an amino acid change (D31N) likely to interfere with the coordination of a divalent metal ion in the active site of this sulfatase. This spontaneous mouse mutant is an excellent model for MPS III A in humans as this disease often arises due to a missense mutation in lysosomal sulfamidase.'",2
"b'The biochemical and biophysical properties of mucins are largely determined by extensive O-glycosylation of serine- and threonine-rich tandem repeat (TR) domains. In a number of human diseases aberrant O-glycosylation is associated with variations in the properties of the cell surface\x96associated and secreted mucins. To evaluate in vivo the O-glycosylation of mucin TR domains, we generated recombinant chimeric mucins with TR sequences from MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, or MUC5B, which were substituted for the native TRs of epitope-tagged MUC1 protein (MUC1F). These hybrid mucins were extensively O-glycosylated and showed the expected association with the cell surface and release into culture media. The presence of different TR domains within the chimeric mucins appears to have limited influence on their posttranslational processing. Alterations in glycosylation were detailed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and reactivity with antibodies against particular blood-group and tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens. Future applications of these chimeras will include investigations of mucin posttranslational modification in the context of disease.'",2
"b""Background Comorbidity scores are increasingly used to reduce potential confounding in epidemiological research. Our objective was to compare metrical and practical properties of published comorbidity scores for use in epidemiological research with administrative databases.\r\n\r\nMethods The literature was searched for studies of the validity of comorbidity scores as predictors of mortality and health service use, as measured by change in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for dichotomous outcomes, and change in R 2 for continuous outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults Six scores were identified, including four versions of the Charlson Index (CI) which use either the three-digit International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or the full ICD-9-CM (clinical modification) code, and two versions of the Chronic Disease Score (CDS) which used outpatient pharmacy records. Depending on the population and exposure under study, predictive validities varied between c = 0.64 and c = 0.77 for in-hospital or 30-day mortality. This is only a slight improvement over age adjustment. In one study the simple measure \x91number of diagnoses\x92 outperformed the CI (c = 0.73 versus c = 0.65). Proprietary scores like Ambulatory Diagnosis Groups and Patient Management Categories do not necessarily perform better in predicting mortality. Comorbidity indices are susceptible to a variety of coding errors.\r\n\r\nConclusions Comorbidity scores, particularly the CDS or D'Hoore's CI based on three-digit ICD-9 codes, may be useful in exploratory data analysis. However, residual confounding by comorbidity is inevitable, given how these scores are derived. How much residual confounding usually remains is something that future studies of comorbidity scores should examine. In any given study, better control for confounding can be achieved by deriving study-specific weights, to aggregate comorbidities into groups with similar relative risks of the outcomes of interest.""",3
"b'Bacterial genomic DNA, plasmid DNA (pDNA) and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) have been proposed to foster a Th1 response via the release of type 1 cytokines from macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells and B cells. In this study, we show that ISS-enriched DNA up-regulates a distinct profile of cell surface molecules on macrophages and B cells in vitro and in vivo. ISS-ODN and ISS-containing pDNA enhanced the expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC class I and II), co-stimulatory molecules (B7-1, B7-2 and CD40), cytokine receptors (IFN-{gamma} receptor and IL-2 receptor), an adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and an Fc receptor (Fc{gamma} receptor) on murine B cells or bone marrow-derived macrophages. The increased expression of these surface molecules is seen in purified cell populations and is largely independent of the effects of type 1 cytokines. Splenic antigen-presenting cells stimulated with ISS-ODN in vivo efficiently activate naive T cells and bias their differentiation toward a Th1 phenotype in vitro . Thus, the induction of both type 1 cytokines and a distinct profile of cell surface molecules contributes to the potent immunostimulatory effects of ISS-containing DNA on innate and adaptive immunity.'",4
"b""The observational evaluation of alcoholics' treatments requires a combined analysis of alcoholic behaviour during treatment and of adherence to therapeutic programmes. The application of survival analysis techniques in this setting has been explored in this study. Two hundred and seventy alcoholics admitted to 15 Italian treatment units in a 1-year period were followed-up for 2 years, recording date and length of every recurrence episode and of definitive or transitory interruption of the planned treatment. An extensive use of several survival analysis techniques was made. The length of time between the start of the treatment and the first episode of relapse did not give a reliable measure of frequency of failures. Conversely, the length of time between the start of treatment and withdrawal appeared to be unbiased. The cumulative proportions of treatment-compliant patients (and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals) were 71% (66\x9676%), 63% (57\x9669%) and 53% (47\x9660%) after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years respectively from the start of treatment. Cumulative abstinence duration before withdrawal was significantly and positively associated with the risk of first, of definitive, and of every episode of treatment interruption. This first application of survival analysis techniques to the combined study of alcoholic behaviour and of adherence to treatment can improve our knowledge of treatment evaluation. Our results suggest that compliance to treatment is an objective and versatile outcome measure. Long-term follow-up studies aimed to elucidate the determinants of withdrawal should be performed.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Background Objective of this re-analysis of datasets from former East and West Germany was to examine the influence of maternal education on intrauterine growth in two different political and social systems.\r\n\r\nMethods Information on socio-demographic or lifestyle factors and pregnancy outcome was available for 3374 liveborn singletons from West Germany (1987/88) and 3070 from East Germany (1990/91). Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the association between maternal education and the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborn below the 10th percentile of birthweight.\r\n\r\nResults Women with the lowest education had a significantly elevated risk of SGA newborns compared to women with the highest education in West (odds ratio [OR] = 2.58, 95% CI : 1.17\x965.67) and East Germany (OR = 2.77, 95% CI : 1.54\x96 5.00). The distribution of factors known to influence intrauterine growth varied with education in both states. After adjusting for these factors, women with the lowest educational level still had a higher risk of SGA birth: OR (West) = 2.02, 95% CI : 0.87\x964.72; OR (East) = 1.95, 95% CI : 1.02\x963.74.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our findings support the assumption that in former socialist countries health inequalities as a result of social inequalities existed.\r\n\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\r\nIn both former German states which had different political, social and health care systems, the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant was higher for less educated women than for women with higher education. \r\nMaternal education reflected a certain constellation of influencing factors which were unique for particular educational levels and stood for better selfcare, better use of the health care system and better knowledge of health-related behaviour. \r\nAdjustment for these factors reduced the magnitude of the observed association somewhat, but could not fully explain the impact of maternal education.

"b'Evidence implicates subtle neuronal pathology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia, but how this pathology is reflected in physiological neuroimaging experiments remains controversial. We investigated PFC function in schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric version of the n-back working memory (WM) task. In a group of patients who performed relatively well on this task, there were three fundamental deviations from the \x91healthy\x92 pattern of PFC fMRI activation to varying WM difficulty. The first characteristic was a greater magnitude of PFC fMRI activation in the context of slightly impaired WM performance (i.e. physiological inefficiency). The second was that the significant correlations between behavioral WM performance and dorsal PFC fMRI activation were in opposite directions in the two groups. Third, the magnitude of the abnormal dorsal PFC fMRI response was predicted by an assay of N-acetylaspartate concentrations (NAA) in dorsal PFC, a measure of neuronal pathology obtained using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients had significantly lower dorsal PFC NAA than controls and dorsal PFC NAA inversely predicted the fMRI response in dorsal PFC (areas 9, 46) to varying WM difficulty \x97 supporting the assumption that abnormal PFC responses arose from abnormal PFC neurons. These data suggest that under certain conditions the physiological ramifications of dorsal PFC neuronal pathology in schizophrenia includes exaggerated and inefficient cortical activity, especially of dorsal PFC.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The {alpha}\xdf TCR recognizes peptides bound to MHC molecules. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction of a soluble TCR {alpha} chain variable domain (V{alpha}4.2\x96J{alpha}40; abbreviated to V{alpha}4.2) with the MHC class II molecule I-Au. V{alpha}4.2 bound specifically to I-Au expressed on the surface of a transfected thymoma cell line. Modifications in the amino acid residues located within the three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the V{alpha} domain did not markedly affect this interaction. However, mutation of glutamic acid to alanine at position 69 of the fourth hypervariable region (HV4{alpha}) significantly increased the binding. Antibody inhibition studies suggested that the binding site was partly contributed by a region of the \xdf chain of I-Au. Furthermore, the binding of V{alpha}4.2 to the MHC molecule was dependent on the nature of the peptide bound in the groove. Soluble V{alpha}4.2 specifically inhibited the activation of TCR transfectants by I-Au-expressing cells pulsed with an N-terminal peptide of myelin basic protein. V{alpha}4.2 also bound to MHC class II-expressing spleen cell populations from mice of the H-2u and H-2d haplotypes. The binding of V{alpha}4.2 to I-A molecules might explain the immunoregulatory effects reported previously for TCR {alpha} chains. This V{alpha}4.2 interaction may also be relevant to models of antigen presentation involving the binding of intact proteins to MHC class II molecules followed by their processing to generate epitopes suitable for T cell recognition.'",4
"b""Background Many reports on Iraq suggest that a rise in rates of death and disease have occurred since the Gulf War of January/February 1991 and the economic sanctions that followed it.\r\n\r\nMethods Four preliminary models, based on unadjusted projections, were developed. A logistic regression model was then developed on the basis of six social variables in Iraq and comparable information from countries in the State of the World's Children report. Missing data were estimated for this model by a multiple imputation procedure. The final model depends on three socio-medical indicators: adult literacy, nutritional stunting of children under 5 years, and access to piped water.\r\n\r\nResults The model successfully predicted both the mortality rate in 1990, under stable conditions, and in 1991, following the Gulf War. For 1996, after 5 years of sanctions and prior to receipt of humanitarian food via the oil for food programme, this model shows mortality among children under 5 to have reached an estimated 87 per 1000, a rate last experienced more than 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nConclusions Accurate and timely estimates of mortality levels in developing countries are costly and require considerable methodological expertise. A rapid estimation technique like the one developed here may be a useful tool for quick and efficient estimation of mortality rates among under 5 year olds in countries where good mortality data are not routinely available. This is especially true for countries with complex humanitarian emergencies where information on mortality changes can guide interventions and the social stability to use standard demographic methods does not exist.""",3
"b'Background There is no accepted and widely used indicator for exclusive breastfeeding since birth. Indeed, the difference between \x91current status\x92 data on exclusive breastfeeding and data on \x91exclusive breastfeeding since birth\x92 is rarely recognized. We used data from a longitudinal study to examine this issue.\r\n\r\nMethods A descriptive longitudinal, prospective study design was used in which 506 mother-infant pairs were included. The mothers completed daily recordings on infant feeding during the first nine months after birth. A research assistant conducted fortnightly home visits with structured interviews. The resulting data on breastfeeding patterns are presented in two different ways: analysis of \x91current status\x92 data based on a single 24-hour recording of infant feeding at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, and analysis of data \x91since birth\x92, i.e. data on infant feeding for every day, starting from birth until the ages of 2, 4 and 6 months.\r\n\r\nResults A wide discrepancy between the results obtained from the two analyses was found. The difference in the exclusive breastfeeding rate was over 40 percentage points at both 2 and 4 months of age (92% versus 51% at 2 months and 73% versus 30% at 4 months) and 9 percentage points at 6 months (11% versus 1.8%).\r\n\r\nConclusions Current status indicators based on a 24-hour period may be inadequate and even misleading for many purposes.

"b'The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the rat is thought to be important for the initiation of behavioural sensitization. Since the mPFC is not a homogenous structure, we attempted to systematic- ally examine the contribution of the different subareas \x96 infralimbic (il), prelimbic (pl), anterior cingulate (cg) \x96 of the mPFC to the induction of sensitization by selectively lesioning these areas or the whole mPFC with quinolinic acid (45 nmol in 0.5 \xb5l). During an initial habituation session only il or whole mPFC lesions reduced spon- taneous activity. Lesioned and sham-lesioned animals were then treated every other day with either saline, DL-amphetamine (3 mg/kg), or cocaine (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks in their home cages and were then challenged with either DL-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg) or cocaine (10 mg/kg) after 1 day and 2 weeks of withdrawal. None of the lesions affected the development of amphetamine-induced sensitization in any way, as assessed by several behavioural parameters including locomotion and sniffing. In contrast, cocaine-induced sensitization was significantly attenuated by pl and whole mPFC lesions, while il and cg lesions were without effect. These results show a double dissociation of the role of the mPFC in behavioural sensitization. The mPFC seems to be important only for cocaine- but not for amphetamine-induced sensitization, and only the pl area appears to be of relevance for cocaine-induced sensitization. It is suggested that these differences are due to differences in the pharmacological interaction of cocaine and amphetamine with the mesocortical dopamine system, and to the particular anatomical connections of each of the mPFC subregions.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The mucosa is one of the initial sites of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection and salivary IgA (sIgA) is thought to be critical to immunity. However, the target epitopes of sIgA and the function of sIgA in GAS immunity, in particular the role of accessory cells and complement, is largely unknown. We studied the aquisition and the function of sIgA specific for a conserved region epitope, p145 (sequence: LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE) of the M protein. Peptide 145-specific sIgA is highly prevalent within an Aboriginal population living in an area endemic for GAS and acquisition of p145-specific sIgA increases with age, consistent with a role for such antibodies in immunity to GAS. Human sIgA and IgG specific for p145 were affinity purified and shown to opsonize M5 GAS in vitro. Opsonization could be specifically inhibited by the addition of free p145 to the antibodies during assay. Opsonization of GAS was totally dependent on the presence of both complement and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and, moreover, affinity-purified p145-specific sIgA was shown to fix complement in the presence of M5 GAS. These data show that mucosal IgA to this conserved region peptide within the M protein has an important role in human immunity against GAS and may be useful in a broad-based cross-protective anti-streptococcal vaccine.'",4
"b'Activation in or near the fusiform gyrus was estimated to faces and control stimuli. Activation peaked at 165 ms and was strongest to digitized photographs of human faces, regardless of whether they were presented in color or grayscale, suggesting that faceand color-specific areas are functionally separate. Schematic sketches evoked ~30% less activation than did face photographs. Scrambling the locations of facial features reduced the response by ~25% in either hemisphere, suggesting that configurational versus analytic processing is not lateralized at this latency. Animal faces evoked ~50% less activity, and common objects, animal bodies or sensory controls evoked ~80% less activity than human faces. The (small) responses evoked by meaningless control images were stronger when they included surfaces and shading, suggesting that the fusiform gyrus may use these features in constructing its face-specific response. Putative fusiform activation was not significantly related to stimulus repetition, gender or emotional expression. A midline occipital source significantly distinguished between faces and control images as early as 110 ms, but was more sensitive to sensory qualities. This source significantly distinguished happy and sad faces from those with neutral expressions. We conclude that the fusiform gyrus may selectively encode faces at 165 ms, transforming sensory input for further processing.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background Maternal nutritional factors have been implicated in the complex aetiology of neural tube defects (NTD). We investigated whether the amount of weight a woman gained during pregnancy was associated with her risk of delivering an infant with an NTD.\r\n\r\nMethods We conducted a population-based case-control study within the cohort of 708 129 live births and fetal deaths occurring in selected California counties in 1989\x961991. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with mothers of 538 (88% of eligible) NTD cases (including those electively terminated, stillborn, or liveborn) and with mothers of 539 (88%) non-malformed liveborn controls within an average of 5 months from the term delivery date. Respondent-reported weight gain during pregnancy (kg) was analysed. Risks of infants having NTD were estimated among women who gained <10kg compared to those who gained >=10kg during >=38 week gestations.\r\n\r\nResults Compared to women who gained >=10kg, an increased risk for NTD offspring was observed among women who gained <10kg (odds ratio [OR] = 3.2, 95% CI : 2.3\x964.6). The OR was 5.0 (95% CI : 2.6\x969.7) among those women who gained <5 kg during pregnancy. The increased risk was not attributable to maternal non-use of a multivitamin containing folic acid, diabetes, NTD-pregnancy history, age, race/ethnicity, education, gravidity, alcohol use, cigarette use, prepregnant obesity, low socioeconomic status, dieting, nausea, nor to lower dietary intakes of folate, zinc, energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and methionine. An increased risk was observed even after simultaneous adjustment for most of these factors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.8). The risk associated with gaining <10kg was greater for anencephaly, but still elevated for spina bifida.\r\n\r\nConclusions We did not have information on weight gain during early pregnancy. Because weight gain during the relevant embryological period for NTD (first month post-conception) is relatively small and often variable, it seems less likely that elevated NTD risks indicate a causal association between lowered weight gain throughout pregnancy and abnormal development of the neural tube. It seems more likely that lowered weight gain is a consequence of carrying an NTD-affected fetus. However, what this consequence is and why risk was substantially larger for anencephaly is unknown.'",3
"b'The process of fertilization begins when sperm contact the outermost egg investment and ends with fusion of the two haploid pronuclei in the egg cytoplasm. Many steps in fertilization involve carbohydrate-based molecular recognition between sperm and egg. Although there is conservation of gamete recognition molecules within vertebrates, their homologues have not yet been discovered in echinoderms and ascidians (the invertebrate deuterostomes). In echinoderms, long sulfated polysaccharides act as ligands for sperm receptors. Ascidians employ egg coat glycosides that are recognized by sperm surface glycosidases. Vertebrate egg coats contain zona pellucida (ZP) family glycoproteins, whose carbohydrates bind to sperm receptors. Several candidate sperm receptors for vertebrate ZP proteins have been identified and are discussed here.

"b""The orbitofrontal cortex has been examined in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the viewpoint of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, its laminar distribution and topography. NFT pathology in the orbitofrontal cortex is extensive in AD. In cases with extensive cortical pathology, NFTs extend from the pole of the frontal lobe to the orbitoinsular junction. In lesser affected cases, the anterior granular part of the orbital cortex is less invested by NFTs. Layers III and V contain the greatest density of NFTs and these are most dense in the dysgranular areas, posterior to the transverse orbital sulcus. Posterior and medial orbitofrontal areas, forming area 13 and the posterior tip of the paraolfactory gyrus, are the most severely damaged, as are the smaller agranular fields that surround the olfactory tract and cortex. The widespread orbitofrontal damage in AD affecting projection neurons suggests that this pathology may contribute heavily to the many non-memory-related behavior changes observed in this disorder.""",1
"b'What happens in the womb sets the stage for development of the child and influences the health of offspring throughout their life course. Until recently, however, most epidemiologists focusing on adult diseases paid little attention to fetal origins of health. Due in part to tantalizing reports that birthweight is associated with health outcomes in both children and adults, that has changed. In this recent surge of interest, the best documented finding for adults is that lower birthweight predicts higher risk of cardiovascular disease.1,2 A smaller but growing literature reports intriguing findings for numerous other domains of child and adult health, for example, higher birthweight has been related to an increased risk of breast and other cancers.1 Especially relevant to the papers in this issue of the Journal are recent findings suggesting that the relation of neurocognitive development to birthweight goes beyond low birthweight and well into the normal birthweight range. The few available reports on birthweight and health in developing countries, including two in this issue, find similar relationships.\r\n\r\nThe accumulating evidence for associations between birthweight and health posed three central challenges from the start: refining the measure of early experience, tracing the causal pathway that connects early experience with later health, and ruling out confounding by social class. As yet, none has been fully met. Nonetheless, progress has been made, and the studies in this issue are noteworthy for pursuing these lines of questioning.\r\n\r\nRefining the measure of early experience\r\n\r\nIn early reports, maternal nutrition was sometimes assumed to be the operative factor. A common view was that poor maternal nutrition led to low birthweight as well as to intrauterine \x91programming\x92, i.e. a long-term alteration in genetically programmed development induced by in utero experience. This hypothesis was a useful starting point but could not explain the complex findings from human studies. Studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter, for example, reported that severe maternal undernutrition in late gestation led to reduced weight, length and head size at birth.3 With respect to later health outcomes, however, early gestation undernutrition was related to increased obesity,4 and increased risk of schizophrenia. Neither early nor late gestation undernutrition was related to IQ at age 18.3,5 More refined hypotheses are needed to explain these results along with the associations noted earlier for birthweight and health.\r\n\r\nAs underscored in the accompanying review paper in this issue,6 many investigators have taken up this challenge and now advance refined \x91nutritional\x92 hypotheses that differentiate fetal from maternal nutrition and specify the relevant dimension and timing of fetal nutrition.6 In addition, intriguing \x91non-nutritional\x92 hypotheses focus on other factors in the intrauterine environment, such as growth hormones and glucocorticoids, that may play a role in intrauterine programming.6 Studies based on birthweight alone cannot make the distinctions required to test these refined hypotheses. We will need epidemiological studies with measures of underlying biological processes as well as complementary animal studies. We can continue to learn much from birthweight, however, particularly when it is combined with other measures of growth. The reports in this issue contribute to this process, by exploring the different predictive powers of birthweight and other measures available at birth. For example, Cheung et al. report that birth length is more influential in predicting childhood motor development than birthweight7 and Law et al. find inverse associations for birthweight, birth length, and head circumference with childhood systolic blood pressure.8 We hope these efforts will be followed by additional research on how best to combine these and other measurements to define meaningful groups in terms of intrauterine nutrition and growth.\r\n\r\nTracing the causal pathway\r\n\r\nThe studies in this issue illustrate the importance of the childhood period in tracing underlying pathways linking birthweight to adult health. Studies of early life exposures and childhood health are important to children, but crucial too for interpreting studies of the fetus and newborn as related to adult health. Childhood data enable us to identify intermediate markers; to follow growth patterns; and to test whether fetal and newborn associations with subsequent health effects can be modified by childhood environment.\r\n\r\nThree studies in this issue examine potential intermediate markers for adult health. Law et al.8 find low birthweight associated with blood pressure as early as age 3; Kelly et al.9 report associations between low birthweight and childhood behaviour; and Nilsson et al. find low birthweight associated with a measure of stress in young men.10 The association of an early antecedent with the marker may differ from its association with the endpoint, however, if an antecedent (e.g. birthweight) has multiple effects across the causal chain, or if pathways to disease are multiple, or if an intermediate marker is much more common than the endpoint.11 An obvious next step is to track these effects over time.\r\n\r\nLikewise, childhood growth measures are important to understanding causal processes because it may not be low birthweight per se but rather a pattern of growth\x97for instance, restricted fetal growth followed by very rapid postnatal \x91catch-up\x92 growth\x97that is important to underlying disease pathways. In this issue, Cheung et al.7 collected multiple growth measures in infancy. They found that the effect of birthweight on motor development was not fully mediated by infant growth measures.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the impact of fetal and infant exposures may be modified by the childhood environment. For example, Kelly et al.9 investigate potential effect modification of the association between birthweight and childhood behaviour by social class. Although their study is inconclusive, this line of investigation should be applied in other studies of birthweight and health. Estimating the presence and extent of modification is important not only to understanding the underlying causal processes but also in designing public health and social policy interventions.\r\n\r\nWhereas most of the studies in this issue concern the period after birth, Shaw et al.12 and Raum et al.13 focused on the period before it. For insight into underlying processes which can illuminate the direction as well as the components of causal relationships, it is vitally important to collect information about the prenatal period.\r\n\r\nConfounding by social class\r\n\r\nThose sceptical of the fetal origins hypothesis can still make a plausible argument that confounding by social environment may explain the observed associations. Social class, for example, is strongly related to birthweight as well as child and adult health. Most of the studies presented in this issue adjust for social class through proxies such as maternal education but none of the measures are entirely satisfactory. Given the strength of social class effects and the more modest associations between birthweight and health, residual confounding due to measurement error is entirely possible. Twin studies might refute this challenge,14 but these are few and the results are sometimes inconsistent. Novel study designs may be needed before the controversy can be put to rest. One such approach may be to compare health outcomes in a large number of same sex siblings who are discordant on measures of early experience such as birthweight.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the collection of studies in this issue are revealing both of how far the field of fetal origin research has come and of how far it still has to go. As we continue to improve the measures of early experience, to formulate better the causal pathways we want to test, and to implement new approaches to control for social class confounding, further advance will undoubtedly result.'",3
"b'Influenza virus is characterized by frequent and unpredictable changes of the surface glycoproteins which enable the virus to escape the immune system. Approved vaccines which consist of the whole virus or the surface glycoproteins fail to induce broad specificity protection. We have previously reported that a peptide-based experimental recombinant vaccine which includes conserved epitopes of B and T lymphocytes was efficient in mice, leading to cross-strain, long-term protection. In the present study, this approach was adapted for the design of a human vaccine, based on epitopes recognized by the prevalent HLAs. These epitopes were expressed in Salmonella flagellin and tested for their efficacy in human/mouse radiation chimera in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are functionally engrafted. The vaccinated mice demonstrated clearance of the virus after challenge and resistance to lethal infection. The production of virus-specific human antibodies was also higher in this group. Control groups of either non-vaccinated, or vaccinated mice which had not been engrafted with the human PBMC, did not exhibit the protective immune response. FACS analysis showed that most human cells in the transplanted mice are CD8+ and CD4+. Hence, it may be concluded: (i) that the protection involves cellular mechanisms, but is most probably accomplished without direct lysis of influenza-infected pulmonary cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, but rather via a cytokine-mediated mechanism, (ii) that the human/mouse radiation chimera model may be of some value in the investigation of new vaccines, as an additional tool prior to clinical trials, and (iii) that the synthetic recombinant vaccine can induce a response in the human immune system and confers protection against influenza infection. Further investigation is needed to establish the efficacy of such a peptide vaccine in human subjects.'",4
"b'Liver fibrosis is commonly observed in chronic liver disease.

Using this fibrosis model, we demonstrated the kinetics of cytokine mRNA expression in liver. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\xdf1, TGF-{alpha}, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor mRNAs were up-regulated after each Con A administration. Furthermore, either anti-IFN-{gamma}, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} or anti-TGF-\xdf mAb given together with Con A markedly inhibited the development of hepatic fibrosis. Treatment with either anti-IFN-{gamma} or anti-TNF-{alpha} mAb also completely prevented hepatic injury; in contrast, treatment with anti-TGF-\xdf mAb did not. The treatment with anti-TGF-\xdf mAb did not affect the levels of hepatic mRNAs for either IFN-{gamma} or TNF-{alpha} after Con A injection. Treatment with either anti-IFN-{gamma} or anti-TNF-{alpha} did not affect the expression levels of TGF-\xdf in the liver. In conclusion, the continuous presence of both severe liver damage and up-regulation of TGF-\xdf synthesis is necessary to induce hepatic fibrosis in this model.'",4
"b'Sialic acid, as a terminal saccharide residue on cell surface glycoconjugates, plays an important role in a variety of biological processes. In this study, we investigated subclones of the human B lymphoma cell line BJA-B for differences in the glycosylation of cell surface glycoconjugates, and studied the functional implications of such differences. With respect to the expression level of most of the tested B cell-associated antigens, as well as the presence of penultimate saccharide moieties on oligosaccharide chains, subclones were phenotypically indistinguishable. Marked differences among subclones, however, were found in the overall level of glycoconjugate sialylation, involving both [alpha]-2,6 and [alpha]-2,3-linked sialic acid residues. Accordingly, subclones were classified as highly- (group I) or hyposialylated (group II). The function of two sialic acid-dependent receptor-mediated processes is correlated with the sialylation status of BJA-B subclones. Susceptibility to and binding of the B lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV) was dependent on a high sialylation status of host cells, suggesting that differential sialylation in BJA-B cells can modulate LPV infection via its [alpha]-2,6-sialylated glycoprotein receptor. CD95-mediated apoptosis, induced by either the human CD95 ligand or a cytotoxic anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody, was drastically enhanced in hyposialylated group II cells. An increase in endogenous sialylation may be one antiapoptotic mechanism that converts tumor cells to a more malignant phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that differential sialylation in a clonal cell line may regulate the function of virus and signal-transducing receptors.'",2
"b'Recent studies point to glycolipid-enriched membrane (GEM) microdomains as the critical sites for TCR-mediated signal transduction. However, whether the TCR complex is localized in the GEM domain is not well-defined. In the present study, we analyzed localization of the TCR\x96CD3 complex in the GEM domain by isolating the GEM fraction with sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Although 10% of TCR{zeta} chains was localized in the GEM fraction, most of the TCR complexes were excluded from the GEM before and after T cell activation, and the amount of TCR{zeta} in the GEM was not increased after activation. However, the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of TCR{zeta} was strongly concentrated in the GEM fraction upon TCR engagement. A kinetic study revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR{zeta} occurred initially in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction followed by the accumulation of phosphorylated TCR{zeta} in the GEM. Thus, these results indicate that phosphorylated TCR{zeta} migrates into the GEM domains on T cell activation. We speculate that the GEM microdomains may function as a reservoir of activation signals from triggered TCR.'",4
"b'Among 86 consecutive consultation-liaison (C-L) patients with current substance use-related hospital attendance, the case records revealed an average history of 5.9 years in male patients and 5.3 years in female patients of repeated substance use-related hospital visits. A history of at least 1 year was found in 60% (52/86) of patients. The history had started at the age of early 30s with attempted suicide as the most common principal diagnosis. By the age of 40, there had been several hospital visits for various health problems. However, 48% (41/86) of the patients had never received substance use treatment. It appeared that opportunities to intervene with substance use were frequently missed on hospital encounters, a finding also observed in earlier studies.'",0
"b'Sialoglycosphingolipids (gangliosides) are membrane components of eukaryotic cells that modulate cell signal transduction events. Discrepancies exist in the published descriptions of the gangliosides present in the human peripheral monocyte/macrophage. Macrophages were isolated from healthy human volunteers by two different methods. Their ganglioside fractions were isolated and examined by 2D thin-layer mobility, enzymatic susceptibility, and mass spectral-collision induced dissociation-mass spectral analyses. Thin-layer ganglioside chromatographic patterns displayed four major doublets and were similar for monocytes/macrophages isolated by either apheresis/elutriation or density gradient centrifugation. All gangliosides were resistant to \xdf-galactosidase but sensitive to Clostridium perfringens sialidase, indicating the absence of terminal galactose residues and sialidase-resistant sialic acid moieties. Mass spectra indicated only three major sets of glycolipid components with mass heterogeneity in the ceramide portion of each set. In all the gangliosides, the ceramide moiety contained only C18 sphingosine with the heterogeneity produced by the presence of C16 or C24 fatty acid. One doublet was resistant to Newcastle disease virus sialidase, indicating the presence of an {alpha}(2-6)-linked sialic acid residue with the same mass as another doublet. All data was consistent with the following structures as the major gangliosides of human peripheral monocyte/macrophages: II3NeuAcLacCer (sialolactosyl ceramide, GM3), IV3- and IV6NeuAcnLcOse4Cer (sialoparagloboside, nLM1), and IV3NeuAcnLcOse6Cer (a sialohexosylceramide).'",2
"b'During T cell development, cells that fail to meet stringent selection criteria undergo programmed cell death. Thymocyte and peripheral T cell susceptibility to apoptosis is influenced by expression of Bcl-2 family members, some of which are expressed in a developmentally patterned manner. We previously showed developmentally regulated expression of A1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, among B cell developmental subsets. Here we show that cells of the T lineage also express A1 in a developmentally regulated manner. Both A1 mRNA and A1 protein are readily detectable in the thymus, and while present among DN cells, A1 mRNA is up-regulated to very high levels among double-positive (DP) thymocytes. It is then down-regulated to moderate levels among single-positive (SP) thymocytes, and finally expressed at ~25-fold lower levels among mature SP CD4+ and CD8+ lymph node T cells than among DP thymocytes. Furthermore, we find that in vitro TCR ligation up-regulates A1 expression among both DP and SP thymocytes. Together, these data show that A1 expression is developmentally regulated in T lymphocytes and is responsive to TCR signaling, suggesting that A1 may play a role in maintaining the viability of DP thymocytes.'",4
"b'The objective of this study was to compare acamprosate with placebo in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients during a 6-month post-detoxification treatment and a 3-month medication-free follow-up. Patients (n = 330) were detoxified and randomized to treatment with acamprosate (1998 mg/day) or placebo within an out-patient programme including medical counselling, psychotherapy and self-help groups. The main outcome criterion was drinking behaviour as assessed by: abstinence/relapse ratio, cumulative abstinence duration (CAD) and the period of continued abstinence. Anxiety, depression and craving were also monitored. Intention to treat (ITT) statistical principles were followed. Twenty-five per cent of patients dropped out over the first 6 months. At the end of the treatment period, the abstinence rate was 57.9% for acamprosate and 45.2% for placebo (P = 0.03). The CAD was 110 \xb1 77 days for acamprosate and 89 \xb1 77 days for placebo (P = 0.016). Patients on acamprosate had a higher continuous abstinence rate and experienced less severe relapses. No differential effect was noted for anxiety, depression or craving. Treatment remained positive, but not significant, 3 months after termination of study medication. No significant difference in adverse events was noted between treatment groups. Acamprosate treatment over 180 days was consistently more effective than placebo to maintain abstinence and to diminish relapse severity.'",0
"b""Background In many cases probands are unable to give information about their own history. Our objective was to compare information given by elderly people on their past and current health and family history of illness with similar information given by a relative, friend or carer.\r\n\r\nMaterial In three urban and two rural areas of England and Wales a sub-sample, weighted by age and cognitive status, was drawn from random population samples of people aged >=65, not permanently living in hospital, and interviewed between 1991 and 1994, plus for each of these a relative, friend or carer.\r\n\r\nMethods The relation between the reports of probands and informants on cognitive function, lifetime illnesses, current health problems, and family history of illness was analysed using multiple regression of agreement, measured using Cohen's kappa, and logistic regression of bias and of proportion of \x91not known\x92 responses. Potential explanatory variables used were: centre, proband cognitive function, proband sex, informant sex, proband age, difference in age (generation), relationship, frequency of contact, period known, modality of informant interview.\r\n\r\nResults Overall agreement per interview measured by kappa between informant and proband was lower for older probands, probands who were cognitively impaired, and those who saw one another less often; each effect adjusted for all the others using multiple regression. Informants tended to over-report relative to probands if the proband was cognitively impaired, male, they themselves were female, of a younger generation, and co-resident; each effect adjusted for all the others using logistic regression. Interviews were more likely to be missing at least one item if the informant was not the spouse, had known the proband for less time, and was not co-resident; each effect adjusted for all the others using logistic regression.\r\n\r\nConclusion There is reasonable accord between probands and informants which is enhanced by close contact, long period of knowledge, and a female informant. Degree of kinship is not critical. Informant interviews may be conducted by telephone rather than face-to-face without serious loss of quality.""",3
"b'The expression of LeY, H2, H3, and H4 on a broad variety of human leukemia cell lines and native lymphocytes as well as on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was examined by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. CD34+ leukemia cell lines (KG1, KG1a, and TF1) and native CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells expressed H2 (CD173) and LeY (CD174). In contrast, CD34\x96 cell lines (HL-60, U937, JOK-1, Raji, Molt-3, Jurkat, and CEM-C7) and mature lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tonsils lacked CD173 and CD174. All cell lines and native lymphocytes as well as CD34+ precursor cells were negative for H3 and H4. Immunoprecipitation and consecutive Western blotting revealed a 170-kDa glycoprotein as the carrier molecule for the CD173 and CD174 oligosaccharide sequences on CD34+ hematopoietic precursors. The key enzyme for generating CD173 is the \xdf-D-galactoside 2-{alpha}-L-fucosyltransferase (FUT1). As shown by RT-PCR, FUT1 was expressed in immature hematopoietic cells but absent in mature lymphocytes, which indicates that expression of CD173 within the hematopoietic system is regulated at the transcriptional level by FUT1. Due to their exclusive presence on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, CD173 and CD174 represent novel markers of early hematopoiesis. The expression of the fucosylated histo-blood group antigens CD173 and CD174 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and down-regulation of FUT1 in mature lymphocytes may be important factors influencing the homing process of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow.'",2
"b'Most microorganisms do not produce sialic acid (sialate), and those that do appear to use a biosynthetic mechanism distinct from mammals. Genetic hybrids of nonpathogenic, sialate-negative laboratory Escherichia coli K-12 strains designed for the de novo synthesis of the polysialic acid capsule from E. coli K1 proved useful in elucidating the genetics and biochemistry of capsule biosynthesis. In this article we propose a dynamic model of sialometabolism to investigate the effects of biosynthetic neu (N-acetylneuraminic acid) and catabolic nan (N-acylneuraminate) mutations on the flux of intermediates through the sialate synthetic pathway. Intracellular sialate concentrations were determined by high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. The results indicated that a strain carrying a null defect in the gene encoding polysialyltransferase (neuS) accumulated > 50 times more CMP\x96sialic acid than the wild type when strains were grown in a minimal medium supplemented with glucose and casamino acids. Metabolic accumulation of CMP\x96sialic acid depended on a functional sialic acid synthase (neuB), as shown by the inability of a strain lacking this enzyme to accumulate a detectable endogenous sialate pool. The neuB mutant concentrated trace sialate from the medium, indicating its potential value for quantitative analysis of free sialic acids in complex biological samples. The function of the sialate aldolase (encoded by nanA) in limiting intermediate flux through the synthetic pathway was determined by analyzing free sialate accumulation in neuA (CMP\x96sialic acid synthetase) nanA double mutants. The combined results demonstrate how E. coli avoids a futile cycle in which biosynthetic sialate induces the system for its own degradation and indicate the feasibility of generating sialooligosaccharide precursors through targeted manipulation of sialate metabolism.'",2
"b'A single gene, SIAT1, encodes ST6Gal I, the sialyltransferase that mediates transfer of [alpha]2,6-linked sialic acids to Gal[beta]1,4GlcNAc termini of N-linked glycoproteins. In vivo, multiple SIAT1 mRNA forms, differing only in the 5[prime]-untranslated region, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. This mRNA heterogeneity has been attributed, at least in part, to transcription from a number of physically distinct promoter regions. In mature B-lymphocytes, SIAT1 transcription initiates at P2, a regulatory region known to function only in B-lineage cells. Bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the control of the P2 region encompassing 415 bp 5[prime]- and 125 bp 3[prime] of the transcriptional initiation site is efficiently expressed in Louckes, a mature B-lymphoblastoid cell line. In contrast, CAT expression in Reh, a T-null/B-null precursor line, and in HepG2, a hepatoma line, are 14-fold and >25-fold less than in Louckes, respectively. The data is consistent with the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements residing both 5[prime] and 3[prime] of the P2 transcriptional initiation site. At least 370 bp of 5[prime]-flanking sequence, coinciding with the inclusion of AP2 and NF-[kappa]B sites, is necessary for high level expression in Louckes. Exon sequences 3[prime] of the transcription start site are also important for expression. A segment from +32 to +125 (position +1 is transcription start site) is capable of exerting promoter-like activity in Louckes, but not in Reh or HepG2. CAT expression by P2 is negligible in Reh cells. However, enhanced CAT activity is not accompanied by elevated mRNA levels. This observation is consistent with the relief of translational restraints imposed by the +32 to +125 region. Together, the data demonstrate that efficient and cell-specific transcription regulation in mature B lymphocytes is contained in a 495 bp P2 segment that is comprised of 370 bp of 5[prime]-flanking region and 125 bp of transcribed region of Exon X.'",2
"b'Sir\x97Ringb\xe4ck Weitoft et al.1 present intriguing evidence indicating that the lower mortality among immigrants compared to the host population in register studies could largely be explained by inaccurate denominator figures. Their findings suggest that immigrants to Sweden, particularly those from Turkey and Southern Europe, frequently remain registered on the national population registry even after returning to their home countries. Thus, an inflated denominator basis would lead to an underestimate of their mortality rate.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, too, the age-adjusted mortality among the 2 million Turkish residents is markedly lower than that of Germans, according to register studies.2 To assess whether this could be due to tbe bias reported by Ringb\xe4ck Weitoft et al. we analysed the mortality experience of immigrants in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). In the SOEP, a representative sample of households is followed up annually. Between 1984 and 1997, 23 769 individuals (25% of them immigrants) had spent a median of 8 years on the panel; 1310 deaths (6.3% among immigrants) were reported. We compared the mortality of immigrants from Turkey and Southern Europe, most of them former guest workers and their family members, to that of Germans in a Poisson regression model.3 Forward-stepwise estimation led to the selection of the variables sex, time period (1991\x961997 versus 1984\x961990), and age in 10-year bands as a continuous and a quadratic term. No significant interactions of relevance were found.\r\n\r\nTable 1Go shows crude mortality rates and adjusted relative risk estimates of immigrants from Turkey and Southern Europe versus German panel members. Immigrants have a significantly lower mortality risk than Germans even after age adjustment. So far, there is no evidence of a secular increase in their mortality.\r\nOur findings demonstrate that in Germany, the comparatively low mortality among immigrants is not explained by over-registration alone. In the SOEP where inaccuracies in the denominator figures can be ruled out, immigrants experience a mortality advantage almost similar in size to that in register studies. Cohort studies in other countries found mortality rates among immigrants that were up to 36% lower in men and 44% lower in women, compared to the host population.4 Kliewer,5 in a review, found mortality advantages of a lower magnitude but lasting 20 years and more. This healthy migrant effect is assumed to be due to (self-) selection at the time of immigration. It is also visible in studies of self-reported morbidity where it diminishes with time of residence in the host country.6 Yet the presence of a healthy migrant effect is not an indication of equity in health, as can be seen e.g. from the higher maternal mortality among women of non-German nationality in Germany.7\r\nWith migration on the rise world-wide, epidemiological studies will increasingly include immigrants in the study population. The healthy migrant effect thus becomes a potential effect modifier that needs to be properly understood and quantified. Future research should identify factors determining the size and possible attenuation with time of the mortality advantage among immigrants. Besides, a numerator bias, e.g. due to a selective re-migration of critically ill individuals to their home countries, should be ruled out.'",3
"b'Background A cryptosporidiosis epidemic occurred among residents and visitors to Collingwood, Ontario, during March 1996. Fifty-five per cent of 36 confirmed cases were Collingwood visitors and 57% of Collingwood resident cases were under 10 years of age. The low level of reported diarrhoeal illness among adult Collingwood residents caused government officials and physicians to question whether an epidemic had occurred in Collingwood.\r\n\r\nMethods To better evaluate the extent of the epidemic, anonymous surplus sera from 89 adult Collingwood residents, collected for routine tests prior to, during and after the epidemic, and from 80 adult Toronto residents were tested using a Western blot assay for IgG antibody response to two Cryptosporidium antigen groups (15/17-kDa and 27-kDa).\r\n\r\nResults For sera collected from 1 January 1996 to 17 June 1996, a higher fraction of Collingwood residents had a detectable serological response (P < 0.002) and the mean intensity of serological responses was higher for Collingwood than Toronto residents (P < 0.001). The mean intensity of serological responses for Collingwood residents was higher in specimens drawn during the 8 weeks following the initial case reports compared to those drawn before or after this period (15/ 17-kDa, P < 0.02; 27-kDa, P < 0.10).\r\n\r\nConclusions These elevated serological responses indicate that Cryptosporidium infections among Collingwood residents likely occurred more commonly than illness reports suggested, consistent with a community-wide cryptosporidiosis epidemic. Similar studies should be considered in future suspected cryptosporidiosis epidemic investigations.'",3
"b""Human lung tumor {alpha}1,3/4-L-fucosyltransferase (FT) was purified (2000-fold, 29% recovery) from 290 g of tissue by including a chromatography step on Affinity Gel-GDP. Two molecular forms (FTA, larger size carrying 15% {alpha}1,4-FT activity; FTB, the major form with 85% activity) were separated by further fractionation on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column. A difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of these two activities was also found on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Both forms were devoid of typical {alpha}1,2-fucosylating activity but were associated with the novel {alpha}1,2-fucosylating ability of converting the Lewis a determinant to Lewis b. Based on percentage activity toward 2-O-MeGal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf-O-Bn, both forms exhibited the same extent of activity toward various acceptors, which included sulfated, sialylated, or methylated LacNAc type 1 or type 2 as well as mucin core 2 acceptors. However, FTA and FTB exhibited a difference in their ability to act on mucin core 2 3'-sialyl LacNAc (activities 24.2% and 40.8%, respectively, as compared to 2-O-MeGal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf-O-Bn). The unsubstituted LacNAc type 1 acceptors were 15\x9620 times as active as the corresponding LacNAc type 2 acceptors. The 3-O-substitution on the \xdf1,4-linked Gal (methyl, sulfate, or sialyl) in mucin core 2 acceptors increased the efficiency of these acceptors five- to eightfold. The most efficient acceptor for FTA and FTB was 3-O-sulfoGal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf-O-Al (Km 100 and 47 \xb5M, respectively). The Km (mM) values for 2-O-methyl Gal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf-O-Bn and 3-O-sialyl Gal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf-O-Bn were 0.40 and 2.5 (FTA) and 0.16 and 0.67 (FTB), respectively.\r\n\r\nThe 35-kDa glycoprotein ancrod (from Malayan pit viper venom) containing 36% complex N-glycans with the antennae NeuAc{alpha}2,3Gal\xdf1,3GlcNAc\xdf- acted as the best macromolecular acceptor substrate (Km: 45 \xb5M), as examined with FTB. On desialylation the acceptor efficiency dropped to ~50% (Km for asialo ancrod: 167 \xb5M). Sialylglycoproteins, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, fetuin, and bovine {alpha}1-acid glycoprotein, were better acceptors than asialo fetuin. On the contrary, fetuin triantennary glycopeptide containing predominantly NeuAc{alpha}2,3Gal\xdf1,4GlcNAc\xdf- was only 55% active as compared to the asialo glycopeptide (Km: 1.43 and 0.63 mM, respectively). Thus, the human lung tumor {alpha}1,3/4-L-FT has the potential to generate clustered sialyl Lewis a and Lewis b determinants in N-glycans and sialyl Lewis x determinant in mucin core 2 structures.""",2
"b'Human erythrocyte polyglycosylceramides (PGCs) are recognized by the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori and are based on a successively extended and highly branched N-acetyllactosamine core linked to ceramide and substituted by fucose and sialic acid. As a step in the identification of the binding epitope we earlier characterized intact PGCs by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, MALDI-TOF MS (Karlsson,H., Johansson,L., Miller-Podraza,H., and Karlsson,K-A. [1999] Glycobiology, 9, 765\x96778). In the present work, PGCs from human blood group O erythrocytes were digested with endo-\xdf-galactosidase (Bacterioides fragilis), an enzyme which cleaves the bond 3Gal\xdf1\x964GlcNAc in linear but not branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. The enzymatic digestion resulted in a mixture of neutral and sialic acid\x96containing glycolipids together with terminal and internal sequences of mainly neutral oligosaccharides. The products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS in both positive and negative ion mode which gave spectra where the ions could be assigned to structures of the neutral and acidic components, respectively. Among glycolipids found were which indicated linear extension along both branches. Observed at higher masses were fully branched structures obtained by stepwise extension with where R could be H, Fuc or NeuAc. Most probably further branching may occur along both the (1->3)- and the (1->6)-linked branches to give a partly dendritic structure. Structures with more than one sialic acid substituted could not be observed in the MALDI spectrum. Complementary information of the terminal sequences was obtained by FAB-MS analysis of permethylated undegraded PGCs. High-temperature gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of reduced and permethylated products from enzyme hydrolysis documented that Fuc was present in a blood group O sequence, Fuc-Hex-HexN-. Fucose may be placed on short (monolactosamine) or longer branches, while sialic acid seems to be restricted to monolactosamine branches. The conclusion is that human erythrocyte PGCs display microheterogeneity within terminal and internal parts of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. The first branch from the ceramide end may be located at the second or third Gal and possibly also on the first Gal. Other branches may occur on every N-acetyllactosamine unit in fully branched domains, or there may be linear extensions between branches resulting in incompletely branched structures. The extended linear sequences may be present in both 3- and 6-linked antennae. Terminal structures are based on one, two or maybe higher number of N-acetyllactosamine units.'",2
"b'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multigenic disease associated with IgG hypergammaglobulinemia, IgG anti-nuclear antibodies and immune complex (IC)-type glomerulonephritis. In both human and murine SLE, one susceptibility allele has been mapped to the interval linked to the IgG Fc receptor II (Fc{gamma}RII) gene on chromosome 1. In spontaneous SLE models of NZB and (NZB x NZW) F1 mice, expression of Fc{gamma}RIIB1, which acts as a negative regulator for B cells, was abnormally down-regulated in follicular germinal center B cells from aged mice, compared to findings in non-SLE NZW, while levels in non-germinal center B cells were practically identical. Such strain differences were also evident in young mice upon in vivo stimulation with foreign antigens. In the Fc{gamma}RIIB promoter region, the NZB allele has two deletion sites, including transcription factor-binding sites. Analyses using (NZB x NZW) F1 x NZW backcross mice showed that this NZB allele was significantly linked to hyper-IgG, irrespective of the MHC haplotype, while high levels of IgG antibodies specific for DNA were regulated by a combinatorial effect of the F1-unique MHC haplotype and the NZB Fc{gamma}RIIB allele. Therefore, the Fc{gamma}RIIB promoter polymorphism may possibly predispose to SLE through germinal center B cells abnormally down-regulating Fc{gamma}RIIB1 expression upon autoantigen stimulations and thus escaping negative signals for IgG production.'",4
"b'Cell migration and adhesion during embryonic development are complex processes which likely involve interactions among cell-surface carbohydrates. While considerable work has implicated proteoglycans in a wide range of developmental events, only limited attention has been directed towards understanding the 7role(s) played by the related class of mucin-type O-glycans. The initial step of mammalian mucin-type O-glycosylation is catalyzed by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGaNTases). The spatial expression patterns of the messenger RNAs of seven ppGaNTase family members were investigated from gastrulation through organogenesis stages of mouse development. The seven glycosyltransferases were expressed in unique patterns during embryogenesis. ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, -T4, and \x96T9 were expressed more ubiquitously than ppGaNTase-T3, -T5, and -T7. Organ systems with discrete accumulation patterns of ppGaNTase family members include the gastrointestinal tract (intestine, liver, stomach, submandibular gland), nervous system (brain, eye), lung, bone, yolk sac, and developing craniofacial region. The pattern in the craniofacial region included differential expression by family members in developing mandible, teeth, tongue and discrete regions of the brain including the pons and migratory, differentiating neurons. Additionally, ppGaNTase-T5 accumulates in a subset of mesenchymal cells at the ventral-most portions of the E12.5 maxilla and mandible underlying the dental lamina. The unique spatiotemporal expression of the different ppGaNTase family members during development suggests unique roles for each of these gene products.'",2
"b'The contribution that alcohol has made to the large fluctuations in mortality in Russia in recent years is now widely recognized. An association between heavy drinking and Russia is part of popular culture. But what is the reality? This paper reviews the evidence on historical patterns of consumption in Russia, highlighting the difficulties of obtaining valid statistics during the Soviet period (1917\x961991). It notes how the state, at various times, encouraged alcohol sales. By the early 1980s, the social cost of heavy drinking was becoming apparent. This led, in 1985, to the imposition of the wide-ranging and initially highly effective anti-alcohol campaign by Mikhail Gorbachev. The features of this campaign and of its subsequent collapse are described. In the 1990s, consumption of alcohol increased rapidly. There has, however, been a recent reduction in alcohol-related deaths. It is concluded that heavy drinking is not an inevitable feature of Russian life and that, as the state has done much to create the present problem, it also has a role to play in resolving it.'",0
"b'There is currently uncertainty regarding the relative performance of a retrospective diary (RD) and a quantity\x96frequency index (QFI) measure of weekly alcohol consumption. While some previous studies have found more consumption reported on an RD than a QFI, others have found the reverse. As yet, however, no study has compared computerized versions of these two measures. This cross-sectional study involved administration of a computerized survey in a community-based drug and alcohol treatment setting. Five hundred and eighty-six clients (420 males) attending counselling for a range of drug- and alcohol-related issues agreed to participate in the study. The major finding was that more alcohol consumption was reported on the RD, than on the QFI. Similarly, the RD detected a greater proportion of both heavy and high-risk drinkers than the QFI. It is argued that the RD may be preferable to the QFI as a measure of weekly alcohol consumption, for use in community-based treatment settings.'",0
"b""Recent studies indicate that GABA acts as a chemoattractant during rat cortical histogenesis. In vivo, GABA localizes in appropriate locations for a chemoattractant, along migratory routes and near target destinations for migrating cortical neurons. In vitro, GABA induces dissociated embryonic cortical neurons to migrate. Here, embryonic rat cortical slices were cultured in the presence or absence of GABA receptor (GABA-R) antagonists to assess GABA's effects on neuronal migration in situ. Gestational day 18 (E18) cortical slices were incubated overnight in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-containing medium to label ventricular zone (vz) cells as they underwent terminal mitosis. The slices were then cultured in BrdU-free medium with or without GABA-R antagonists. In control slices, most BrdU+ cells were observed in the cortical plate (cp) after 48 h. In contrast, cultures maintained in either saclofen (a GABAB-R antagonist) or picrotoxin (a GABAA/C-R antagonist) had few BrdU-labeled cp cells. However, the effects of the two antagonists were distinct. In the picrotoxin-treated slices, nearly half of all BrdU+ cells remained in the vz and subventricular zone (svz), whereas saclofen treatment resulted in an accumulation of BrdU+ cells in the intermediate zone (iz). Bicuculline, a GABAA-R antagonist, did not block, but rather enhanced migration of BrdU+ cells into the cp. These results provide evidence that picrotoxin-sensitive receptors promote the migration of vz/svz cells into the iz, while saclofen-sensitive receptors signal cells to migrate into the cp. Thus, as cortical cells differentiate, changing receptor expression appears to modulate migratory responses to GABA.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'One hundred cases of individuals assessed for alcohol-related cognitive performance were examined. The assessment included demographic and alcohol consumption data, as well as performance on tests of auditory verbal learning, memory, motor skills, general intellectual functioning, and visuo-spatial functioning. All participants regularly drank in excess of 10 standard drinks/session. Fifty cases were binge drinkers who consumed alcohol on 2 days/week or less and 50 cases were individuals who consumed alcohol daily. The two groups of drinkers were statistically matched on a number of demographic and misuse factors. The results indicated similar performance for both the binge drinkers and the regular drinkers in visuo-motor speed, visuo-spatial organization and planning, learning, proactive interference, retroactive interference, and retrieval efficiency. However, performance differences were observed on tasks that required semantic organizational ability, with binge drinkers performing better than regular drinkers on these tasks. Due to the differences in the cognitive performance of the two groups, it was concluded that drinking pattern is an important factor in investigating cognitive performance in alcoholics.'",0
"b'HLA-G plays an essential role in feto-maternal tolerance by inhibiting lysis by maternal NK cells. The factors that allow tissue-specific activation of HLA-G gene expression in trophoblasts remain to be characterized. We investigated the potential effect of IL-10, a cytokine which is secreted in placenta, on HLA-G gene transcription in trophoblasts. Using Northern blot, RNase protection assay and RT-PCR analysis, we demonstrated that IL-10 enhances steady-state levels of HLA-G transcription in cultured trophoblast cells. We further tested the effect of IL-10 on HLA-G gene transcription and protein expression in peripheral blood monocytes, showing that IL-10 can up-regulate HLA-G cell surface expression in this cell type. This effect of IL-10 is selective, since classical MHC class I products and MHC class II are down-regulated in monocytes following IL-10 treatment. Induction of HLA-G expression by IL-10 on monocytes may thus play a role in down-regulation of the immune response. We propose that IL-10 secretion by trophoblasts during pregnancy may also influence the HLA class I expression pattern at the feto-maternal barrier, thus protecting the fetus from rejection. This should be taken into consideration in the design of treatment for pathologies of pregnancy.'",4
"b'Modulation of the strength of signals from the TCR determines the outcome of positive and negative selection in thymocyte development. Previous studies have demonstrated that SHP-1 plays a role in determining signal strength from the TCR. Here, we have taken a genetic approach to test whether SHP-1 plays a role in T cell selection in the thymus. Experiments in which a dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 was expressed in the BYDP hybridoma cell line confirmed that SHP-1 regulated TCR signaling in a cell-autonomous manner and suggested that Lck is one of its targets. To examine the role of SHP-1 in T cell development, we crossed the ovalbumin-specific DO11.10 TCR transgene onto the motheaten background, which lacks SHP-1 expression. Analysis of the progeny of these crosses provided evidence that SHP-1 regulates thymocyte selection: (i) flow cytometric analyses revealed alterations in the percentages of thymocyte subpopulations in the me/me background; (ii) ex vivo deletion experiments demonstrated that me/me:Tg thymocytes undergo negative selection at lower concentrations of OVA peptide compared to +/+:Tg thymocytes; and (iii) ex vivo proliferation analyses indicated that me/me:Tg thymocytes were hyper-sensitive to stimulation by the specific OVA peptide. Our observation that the absence of SHP-1 leads to altered selection of TCR transgenic thymocytes demonstrates that SHP-1 regulates the strength of TCR-mediated signals in vivo and, in turn, helps to set the threshold for thymocyte selection.'",4
"b'Several anti-Fas ligand (FasL) inhibitory mAb (FLIM) were raised and characterized in this study. One, FLIM58, showed more potent neutralizing activity than Fas-Fc, the previously established artificial neutralizing agent for FasL. Several murine models of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation have been used to show that both FasL and perforin, the major effector molecules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are involved in this disease. In our GVHD model, FasL rather than perforin was associated with lethality. Administration of FLIM58 or Fas-Fc reduced the weight loss and mortality caused by GVHD, although other signs of GVHD, such as skin lesions, lymphoid hypoplasia and mononuclear cell infiltration in the liver, did not improve significantly. FLIM58 was more effective than Fas-Fc in reducing mortality. Our results demonstrated that neutralizing agents for FasL are therapeutic for lethal GVHD.'",4
"b'The precursor oligosaccharide donor for protein N-glycosylation in eukaryotes, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, is synthesized in two stages on both leaflets of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). There is good evidence that the level of dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P) is one rate-controlling factor in the first stage of the assembly process. In the current topological model it is proposed that ER proteins (flippases) then mediate the transbilayer movement of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the lumenal leaflet. The rate of flipping of the three intermediates could plausibly influence the conversion of Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol in the second stage on the lumenal side of the rough ER. This article reviews the current understanding of the enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of Dol-P and other polyisoprenoid glycosyl carrier lipids and speculates about the role of membrane proteins and enzymes that could be involved in the transbilayer movement of the lipid intermediates and the recycling of Dol-P and Dol-P-P discharged during glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, N-glycosylation, and O- and C-mannosylation reactions on the lumenal surface of the rough ER.'",2
"b'Neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Background This study was conducted as part of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.\r\n\r\nObjective To compare information given by elderly people on their past and current health and family history of illness with similar information obtained from a relative, friend or carer.\r\n\r\nDesign Screening and assessment stages of a prevalence study.\r\n\r\nSetting Three urban and two rural areas of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nParticipants A subsample weighted by age and cognitive status of random population samples of people >=65 years, living in their own home or in a residential or nursing home, interviewed between 1991 and 1994. A relative, friend or carer identified by each elderly person to provide proxy information.\r\n\r\nInterview Computerized schedules including items on demographic details, cognitive function, lifetime illnesses, current health problems and family history of illness.\r\n\r\nResults The rate of proxy \x91don't know\x92 responses and the agreement between the elderly person and their proxy were calculated for each item, both for the overall sample and for subgroups based on characteristics of the respondent and of the proxy and on the relationship between them. Higher \x91don't know\x92 rates were found to be particularly associated with more distant relationships, questions on family history, a shorter length of time known and a lack of co-residence. Agreement was strongly related to the nature of the question and less to co-residence, with other factors such as relationship having much smaller effects.\r\n\r\nConclusions Proxy information on past and current health problems can be almost complete and in good agreement with self-report, particularly where the proxy lives with the respondent. On family history of illness, history of head injury or boxing and current sleep problems, proxy information is likely to be less complete and show poor agreement. A proxy who is not a close relative is likely to give less complete information but agreement will not be substantially lower.""",3
"b'An important problem in the neurobiology of memory is whether cellular mechanisms of learning and memory include the formation of new synapses or the remodeling of existing ones. To elucidate this problem, numerous studies have examined alterations in the number and structure of synapses following behavioral learning and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which is viewed as a synaptic model of memory. The data reported in the literature and obtained in this laboratory are analyzed here to evaluate what kind of structural modification is likely to account for synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory. It has been demonstrated that LTP induction elicits the formation of additional synapses between activated axon terminals and newly emerging dendritic spines. Similarly, some forms of learning have been shown to increase the number of synapses. Although many ultrastructural studies examining the effect of LTP or learning failed to find a change in total synapse number, this population measure might not detect an increase in a small proportion of synapses established by activated terminals. LTP and learning have also been shown to induce a remodeling of synapses. This process is proposed to involve the transformation of certain synaptic subtypes into more efficacious ones, including the conversion of \x91silent\x92 synapses into functional synapses. It appears, therefore, that cellular mechanisms of learning and memory are likely to include both synaptogenesis and synapse remodeling.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We studied responses of the parieto-frontal opercular cortex to electric stimuli, as recorded by intracortical electrodes during stereotactic EEG presurgical assessment of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. After electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist, we consistently recorded a negative\x96 positive biphasic response peaking at 60 ms (N60) and 90 ms (P90) post-stimulus in the upper bank of the sylvian fissure contralateral to stimulation. Talairach stereotactic coordinates of the electrode contacts recording these responses covered the pre- and post-rolandic part of the upper bank of the sylvian fissure (25 < x < 55 mm; \x9627 < y < +13 mm; 0 < z < 21 mm), corresponding to the accepted localization of SII area in man. The sources of these responses were deeply situated in the cortex of the upper bank of the sylvian fissure at ~40 mm from the midline sagittal plane, so that some of them could be located in the insular cortex. Moreover this study suggests the existence of dipolar SII sources radial to the scalp surface, which are overlooked in magnetic recordings. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded in SII are delayed by ~40 ms as compared with SEPs generated in the primary somatosensory cortex. This long delay between SI and SII responses is not fully explained though it is coherent with the timing of activation issued from MEG source modeling data.'",1
"b'Injection of a staphylococcal superantigen (SAg) such as staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in adult mice results in cytokine production and cell proliferation which can lead to septic shock. The aim of the present work was to identify the cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules regulating the in vivo systemic release of IFN-{gamma}, a cytokine known to play an important role in the pathophysiology associated with bacterial infections. We demonstrate in this study that (i) in contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), SEB administration induces high levels of the p70, bioactive form, of IL-12; (ii) IL-12 production in response to SEB requires both CD40-dependent signals and IFN-{gamma} secretion; (iii) the early systemic release of IFN-{gamma} (3 h post-treatment) in response to SEB is IL-12 independent, while the sustained, late response (6\x969 h post-treatment) requires endogenous IL-12 production; (iv) IL-12 produced during the primary SEB response (day 0) is responsible for priming cells in vivo to high IFN-{gamma} production upon secondary challenge (day 2); (v) the priming effect of IL-12 is TCR unrelated, as SEB-primed animals secrete high levels of IFN-{gamma} in response to both staphylococcal enterotoxin A and LPS administered 48 h later. The ability of bacterial SAg to induce septic shock and to modulate the immune response to unrelated antigens may therefore be related to their unique capacity to induce systemic IL-12 production in vivo. These observations also help to explain why SEB-primed animals, known to express an anergic phenotype 48 h post-treatment (as judged by defective IL-2 production and proliferation), nevertheless display an increased capacity to secrete the inflammatory cytokine IFN-{gamma}.'",4
"b'To explore the biological role of carbohydrate chains in the process of nerve cell differentiation, we carried out a characterization of the carbohydrate structure of glycoproteins by comparing conventional PC12 cells with variant cells (PC12D). In vitro metabolic labeling of cells with either [3H] glucosamine or [3H] threonine, together with tomato lectin staining, revealed that nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation caused a decrease in the poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis of high-molecular-weight glycopeptides from PC12 cells. By comparison, the amount of glycopeptides with poly-N-acetyllactosamine from PC12D cells was already significantly low and it was not changed by NGF stimulation.\r\n\r\nBy assaying the glycosyltransferases that participate in poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis, the decrease in the amount of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine in PC12D cells as well as NGF-stimulated PC12 cells could be accounted for by a reduction in the activity of poly-N-acetyllactosamine extension enzyme (GnT-i), because the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosamine in both cells precisely correlated with changes in GnT-i activity, whereas the activities of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) and \xdf1-4 galactosyltransferase remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nThese results demonstrate that the decrease in poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis in PC12 cells occurred prior to neurite formation, whereas PC12D cells were insensitive to this effect. Next, we showed that GnT-i but not GnT-V catalyzed a rate-limiting reaction in the expression of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, especially in pheochromocytoma.'",2
"b'Background In addition to cigarettes, bidi, made of unprocessed and low-grade tobacco, is being smoked widely in Bangladesh and in other south Asian countries. The cause-and-effect relationship is established between thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) and smoking. However, type of smoking material(s) most strongly related to TAO is not yet determined.\r\n\r\nMethods We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in Rajshahi, Bangladesh, to examine the relationship of type of smoking materials (cigarette versus bidi) with TAO on 103 pairs of cases and controls matched by age and sex during the period 1995 to 1996. The inclusion criteria for cases were newly diagnosed TAO and current smoker, while those for controls were current smokers admitted to the hospital due to non-cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nResults Among the cases 35.0% and 65.0% were cigarette and bidi smokers, while among the controls 69.9% and 30.1%, respectively. Using logistic regression approach, considering cigarette smoking ~10 per day as reference, bidi smoking >20 per day (odds ratio [OR] = 34.76, 95% CI : 6.11\x96197.67) and 11\x9620 per day (OR = 7.12, 95% CI : 2.35\x9621.63) had greater risk of TAO after adjusting confounding factors. Respective OR for bidi smoking ~10 per day, cigarette smoking 11\x9620 per day and cigarette smoking >20 per day, were 2.18 (95% CI : 0.64\x967.51), 3.81 (95% CI : 1.37\x9610.57) and 6.88 (95% CI : 1.87\x9625.30).\r\n\r\nConclusion Within the limits inherent to case-control study, our findings suggest that bidi smoking may well play a more important role in causing TAO than cigarettes. It leads to the speculation that unprocessed and low-grade tobacco used for producing bidi might play a more potent role to initiate TAO than cigarettes.'",3
"b'We performed a biochemical and histochemical study of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the tissues of the ascidian Styela plicata. A highly sulfated dermatan sulfate and a heparin-like polymer, identified by incubation with specific lyases, occur at different concentrations in intestine, heart, pharynx, and cloak. Dermatan sulfate prevails in the pharynx, whereas the heparin-like polymer abounds in the intestine. Staining of tissues sections with the cationic dye 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue before and after incubation with specific lyases revealed that the dermatan sulfate occurs in the extracellular matrix, while the heparin-like polymer is located within cytoplasmic granules of cells in the lumen of intestine and pharynx. The dermatan sulfate has a similar disaccharide composition in all tissues studied, whereas the heparin-like polymer differs in sulfate content. A direct relationship between sulfate content of the heparin-like polymer and antithrombin activity was observed. Analysis of the repeating disaccharide units of the heparin-like polymer indicates the presence of relatively high amounts of the disulfated disaccharide namely {Delta}UA-1->4-GlcN(SO4)-(6SO4), which may suggest the occurrence in ascidians of regulatory biosynthetic mechanisms different from those observed for heparin in mammals.'",2
"b'Background Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I and II (HTLV-I and II) are human retroviruses that can be transmitted by transfusion of whole blood. An HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). Antibody tests from 5.5 million European blood donors have shown that the HTLV prevalence is low, ranging from 0 to 0.02%. This paper examines costs and effects associated with the intervention of testing all new blood donors for HTLV.\r\n\r\nMethods A mathematical model was used to calculate the number of cases prevented by the intervention. For a given prevalence of HTLV in the blood donor population, the model calculates the number of recipients infected by transfusion, and the number of partners and offspring that will in turn be infected. The model then calculates the number of subjects with disease due to HTLV-I infection and the number of deaths from disease. From these numbers the measures of cost and effect are calculated.\r\n\r\nResults Testing all new blood donors for HTLV is calculated to cost US$ 9.2 million per life saved, or US$ 420 000 per quality adjusted life year gained by the intervention, when the HTLV prevalence among donors is 1 per 100 000. When the prevalence among donors is 10 per 100 000 the intervention will cost US$ 0.9 million per life saved, or US$ 41 000 per quality adjusted life year gained. The same analysis shows that testing blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) saves money when the HIV prevalence among donors is above 0.7 per 100 000.\r\n\r\nConclusion For Norway, studies suggest a willingness to pay to save a statistical life of approximately US$ 1.2 million. The costs fall under this value when the number of infected persons is >=8 per 100 000 donors. The results are uncertain because of the uncertainty in HTLV infection and disease parameters.'",3
"b'Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn associate with the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Accumulating data show that Lyn plays important roles in BCR-mediated signaling, while the role of Fyn remains obscure. Here we dissected the role of Fyn and Lyn in BCR signaling using B cells from fyn\x96/\x96, lyn\x96/\x96 and fyn/lyn double-deficient (fyn\x96/\x96lyn\x96/\x96) mice. In contrast to previous reports, fyn\x96/\x96 B cells were slightly hyporeactive to both anti-IgM and anti-IgD\x96dextran. Although lyn\x96/\x96 B cells were hyper-reactive to anti-IgM, anti-IgD-induced proliferation was impaired in lyn\x96/\x96 B cells. Most of the other phenotypes of fyn\x96/\x96lyn\x96/\x96 mice were similar to that of lyn\x96/\x96 mice, except that proliferative responses of B cells to various stimuli, such as BCR cross-linking and lipopolysaccharide, were significantly lower in fyn\x96/\x96lyn\x96/\x96 mice than in lyn\x96/\x96 mice. Finally, immune responses to thymus-independent type 2 antigen were affected in these mutant mice. These observations suggest that Fyn and Lyn are involved in B cell functions, and play similar, but partly distinct, roles in BCR signaling.'",4
"b'The formation of discrete functional areas is a key event in the development of the cerebral cortex. The expression patterns of several molecules associated with axon guidance reveal specification of regional identity during fetal development within the cortex, with different area-specific features acquired at very early to later stages of corticogenesis. Cell culture experiments suggest that complex mechanisms regulate the differentiation of region-appropriate phenotypes. In all instances that we have examined thus far, however, the final phenotype adopted by cortical neurons is governed by the capacity of the cell to respond to regionalizing signals; this is reflected in the heterogeneity of receptor expression by progenitors, and the temporal and spatial distribution of such signals within the forebrain.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral cortex is characterized by its organization into laminae in the radial domain and into functional areas in the tangential domain. Such an organization requires the generation of diverse neuronal phenotypes each distinguished by the expression of unique molecules, some of which may participate in the wiring of specific patterns of connectivity. The developmental processes and specific molecular signals governing the determination of these phenotypes are currently subjects of intense focus [for review see Levitt (Levitt, 1999Go)]. Here, we address the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of regional identities. We present evidence that there are molecules expressed in unique patterns, often reflecting functional domains, within both the developing cerebral wall and mature cortex. We examine the stage at which cortical progenitors becomes restricted to a particular regional fate, demonstrating that while certain regionally restricted phenotypes are specified within the ventricular zone, others require signals that are only present at later stages of corticogenesis. Finally, we propose that the final regional phenotype adopted by a given cortical neuron is dependent upon both the intrinsic capacity of the cell to respond to extracellular signals and the spatial distribution of those signals within the forebrain.'",1
"b'Background The prevalence of epilepsy was estimated in two villages of 3134 inhabitants, in Benin, in April and May 1997 using the capture-recapture method.\r\n\r\nMethods Information was obtained from (i) a door-to-door cross-sectional study, (ii) a non- medical source consisting of key informants (traditional practitioners, teachers, village leaders, and religious representatives) and (iii) a medical source through evaluation of medical records in health centres. In all the three situations, the diagnosis of epilepsy was confirmed by a neurologist.\r\n\r\nResults The door-to-door survey found 50 epileptics, i.e. a prevalence of 15.9 per 1000. The non-medical source found 26 patients. The medical source found only four patients. In total, 66 epileptics were found by combining the three sources, giving a prevalence of 21.1 per 1000. After application of the capture-recapture method, the estimated number of cases from the door-to-door survey and non-medical source was 105, and 110 cases when the medical source was considered as well. The respective prevalences were 33.5 per 1000, and 35.1 per 1000.\r\n\r\nConclusions The door-to-door survey has been usefully improved by using key informants. The epilepsy prevalence estimate found by capture-recapture is clearly higher than that found by traditional cross-sectional methods, and could better depict the frequency of epilepsy in Africa.'",3
"b'The interactions between a human CD4+ T cell clone and monocyte-derived human dendritic cells (DC) were analyzed with an imaging system. The first question addressed was the relationship between the formation of a contact zone and the triggering of a Ca2+ response in the T cells, in the presence or absence of antigen. Interaction of T cells with DC pulsed with the antigen led to the formation of a stable contact zone, followed by the appearance in the T cells of large and sustained Ca2+ oscillations. In the absence of antigen, contact zones formed normally and, surprisingly, Ca2+ responses were also observed, characterized by rare and small transients. Antigen-independent Ca2+ responses were not MHC restricted. The possible influence of Ca2+ responses in the DC on the efficiency of antigen presentation was then investigated. In DC, Ca2+ responses can be elicited by a variety of stimuli: cell adhesion, platelet-activating factor, UTP and chemotactic molecules (formyl-Met\x96Leu\x96Pro, RANTES, MIP-1\xdf and SDF-1{alpha}). Importantly, Ca2+ responses were also induced in ~30% of DC as a result of their interaction with T cells. However, the efficiency of antigen presentation (as judged by the percentage of T cells presenting a Ca2+ response) was independent of the Ca2+ level in DC. Thus, imaging the interactions between human T cells and DC led us to observe two novel phenomena: DC-induced but antigen-independent Ca2+ responses in T cells and T cell-induced Ca2+ responses in DC.'",4
"b'Background The siesta (afternoon nap or rest), a common traditional behaviour in tropical areas, may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) since the post siesta cardiovascular response very closely resembles the period soon after waking up in the morning when the onset of acute cardiovascular events is high.\r\n\r\nMethods We studied 505 MI survivors and 522 randomly selected controls, matched for age, gender, and area of residence, in a population-based case-control study in Costa Rica. Participation rates were 97% for cases and 90% for controls. All subjects completed a physical activity questionnaire that included occupational and leisure time components with specific questions on siesta. Five siesta frequency categories (<1/wk, 1\x964/wk, 5\x966/wk, daily [>=1 h and <2 h], and daily [>=2 h and <3:30 h]) were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) by multiple logistic regression.\r\n\r\nResults Compared to controls, cases were more likely to take daily siestas (44 versus 35%, P = 0.01), and spend more time per siesta (1:07 \xb1 0:04 versus 0:54 \xb1 0:04 h:min, P = 0.002). As compared to subjects with the lowest siesta frequency (<1/wk), the OR for MI among those in the highest category was 1.51 (95% CI : 1.02\x962.25, P for trend = 0.006). After adjusting for risk factors, lifestyle, and health history the OR across the siesta categories were 1.0, 0.77, 1.28. 1.66, and 1.40 (P for trend = 0.02).\r\n\r\nConclusions Our data suggest that the practice of daily siesta is associated with increased risk of MI.'",3
"b'The 4-amino-6-deoxy-monosaccharide D-perosamine is an important element in the glycosylation of interesting cell products, such as antibiotics and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The biosynthetic pathway of the precursor molecule, GDP-D-perosamine, in Vibrio cholerae O1 starts with an isomerisation of fructose-6-phosphate catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme phosphomannose isomerase\x96guanosine diphosphomannose pyrophosphorylase (RfbA; E.C. 2.7.7.22) creating the intermediate mannose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently converted by the phosphomanno-mutase (RfbB; E.C. 5.4.2.8) and further by RfbA to GDP-D-mannose, to GDP-4 keto-6-deoxymannose by a 4,6-dehydratase (RfbD; E.C. 4.2.1.47) and finally to GDP-D-perosamine by an aminotransferase (RfbE; E.C. not yet classified).\r\n\r\nWe cloned the rfbD and the rfbE genes of V. cholerae O1 in Escherichia coli expression vectors. Both biosynthetic enzymes were overproduced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and their activities were analyzed. The enzymatic conversion from GDP-D-mannose to GDP-D-perosamine was optimized and the final product, GDP-D-perosamine, was purified and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and chromatography. The catalytically active form of the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose-4-aminotransferase seems to be a tetramer of 170 kDa. The His-tag RfbE fusion protein has a Km of 0.06 mM and a Vmax value of 38 nkat/mg protein for the substrate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose. The Km and Vmax values for the cosubstrate L-glutamate were 0.1 mM and 42 nkat/mg protein, respectively. The intention of this work is to establish a basis for both the in vitro production of GDP-D-perosamine and for an in vivo perosaminylation system in a suitable bacterial host, preferably E. coli.'",2
"b'A soluble form of ribophorin I (RI332) is rapidly degraded in Hela and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by a cytosolic proteasomal pathway, and the N-linked glycan present on the protein may play an important role in this process. Specifically, it has been suggested that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase I could trigger the targeting of improperly folded glycoproteins to degradation. We used a CHO-derived glycosylation-defective cell line, MadIA214, for investigating the role of mannosidase(s) as a signal for glycoprotein degradation. Glycoproteins in MadIA214 cells carry truncated Glc1Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans. This oligomannoside structure interferes with protein maturation and folding, leading to an alteration of the ER morphology and the detection of high levels of soluble oligomannoside species caused by glycoprotein degradation. An HA-epitope-tagged soluble variant of ribophorin I (RI332-3HA) expressed in MadIA214 cells was rapidly degraded, comparable to control cells with the complete Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 N-glycan. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of RI332-3HA was also proteasome-mediated in MadIA214 cells, as demonstrated by inhibition of RI332-3HA degradation with agents specifically blocking proteasomal activities. Two inhibitors of {alpha}1,2-mannosidase activity also stabilized RI332-3HA in the glycosylation-defective cell line. This is striking, because the major mannosidase activity in the ER is the one of mannosidase I, specific for a mannose {alpha}1,2-linkage that is absent from the truncated Man5 structure. Interestingly, though the Man5 derivative was present in large amounts in the total protein pool, the two major species linked to RI332-3HA shortly after synthesis consisted of Glc1Man5 and Man4, being replaced by Man4 and Man3 when proteasomal degradation was inhibited. In contrast, the untrimmed intermediate of RI332-3HA was detected in mutant cells treated with mannosidase inhibitors. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that an {alpha}1,2-mannosidase that is not ER mannosidase I is involved in ERAD of RI332\x963HA in the glycosylation-defective cell line, MadIA214.'",2
"b'The appearance of chronic intestinal inflammation in IL-10 knockout mice suggests IL-10 may inhibit adverse responses to luminal antigen. Moreover, this inflammation is associated with an increase in class II MHC molecule expression on intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the role of IL-10 regulation in epithelial cell function was investigated. Using RT-PCR, it was shown that intestinal epithelial cells express mRNA for both subunits of the IL-10 receptor-signaling complex. In addition, biotinylated IL-10 was shown to bind to both cultured and freshly isolated intestinal epithelial cells prepared from the small or large intestine. This binding appeared specific as it was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to IL-10 but not the isotype control. Moreover, an excess of native IL-10 also inhibited the binding of radiolabeled IL-10. To evaluate whether IL-10 mediated any functions through this receptor, epithelial cells were cultured with IL-10 alone or with IFN-{gamma} plus IL-10. IL-10 alone had no detectable effects on epithelial cell growth or their expression of class II MHC molecules but it did antagonize the effect of IFN-{gamma} on the viability of cultured cells. In addition, IL-10 blocked the IFN-{gamma}-induced expression of class II MHC molecules on cultured epithelial cells. These results suggest that IL-10 binds to a specific receptor on intestinal epithelial cells and may regulate the contribution of epithelial cells to the inflammatory and immune response in the digestive tract.'",4
"b""The supracallosal medial frontal cortex can be divided into three functional domains: a ventral region with connections to the limbic system, an anterior dorsal region with connections to lateral prefrontal systems, and a posterior dorsal region with connections to lateral motor systems. Lesion and functional imaging studies implicate this medial frontal cortex in speech and language generation. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of word generation was designed to determine which of these three functional domains was substantially involved by mapping individual subjects' functional activity onto structural images of their left medial frontal cortex. Of 28 neurologically normal right-handed participants, 21 demonstrated a prominent paracingulate sulcus (PCS), which lies in the anterior dorsal region with connections to lateral prefrontal systems. Activity increases for word generation centered in the PCS in 18 of these 21 cases. The posterior dorsal region also demonstrated significant activity in a majority of participants (16/28 cases). Activity rarely extended into the cingulate sulcus (CS) (3/21 cases) when there was a prominent PCS. If there was no prominent PCS, however, activity did extend into the CS (6/7 cases). In no case was activity present on the crest of the cingulate gyrus, which is heavily connected to the limbic system. Thus, current findings suggest that medial frontal activity during word generation reflects cognitive and motor rather than limbic system participation. The current study demonstrates that suitably designed fMRI studies can be used to determine the functional significance of anatomic variants in human cortex.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'Background Mortality trends and patterns for pulmonary embolism may yield clues to its aetiology. Previous investigations had identified several mortality contrasts in pulmonary embolism mortality among US residents. These findings had been made in the context of a trend of increasing rates during 1962\x961984.\r\n\r\nMethods Annual age-specific and age-adjusted pulmonary embolism mortality rates for US residents during 1979\x961996 were compiled from the US National Center for Health Statistics web site. These data were analysed for mortality contrasts and trends.\r\n\r\nResults For all racial-gender groups, age-adjusted mortality declined throughout the period. The greatest rate of decline was found among black men, followed by (in decreasing order) black women, white men, other men, white women, and other women. In 1996, the previously observed demographic contrasts of blacks experiencing the highest pulmonary embolism mortality, followed by whites and then others, and the male rate being higher than the female one were still present despite this decline. Age-specific mortality from pulmonary embolism in the US during 1996 also mirrored that reported for the 1970s, with mortality increasing during the life span (the risk of death doubling with each decade of life). Specifically, the annual age-adjusted pulmonary embolism mortality rate in 1996 for white men was 2.4 per 100 000 persons; white women, 2.3 per 100 000 persons; black men, 6.0 per 100 000 persons; black women, 4.8 per 100 000 persons; non-black non-white men, 1.0 per 100 000 persons; and non-black non-white women, 0.7 per 100 000 persons.\r\n\r\nConclusions Mortality from pulmonary embolism in the US declined significantly during 1979\x961996. Several demographic contrasts, particularly an excess among men, continue to exist.'",3
b'To investigate the screening properties of the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in the detection of alcohol-related problems among Nigerian university students. Methods: Eight hundred and ten students completed the AUDIT. A percentage of them were assessed for alcohol-related diagnosis with structured clinical interview. Results: The AUDIT at cut-off of 5 and above could clearly identify participants with alcohol-related problems with sensitivity of 0.935 and specificity of 0.915. Conclusions: The AUDIT is a valid instrument for screening for alcohol-related problems in Nigerian university students.\r\n\r\n',0
"b'Bronchial mucins were purified from the sputum of 14 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and 24 patients suffering from chronic bronchitis, using two CsBr density-gradient centrifugations. The presence of DNA in each secretion was used as an index to estimate the severity of infection and allowed to subdivide the mucins into four groups corresponding to infected or noninfected patients with cystic fibrosis, and to infected or noninfected patients with chronic bronchitis. All infected patients suffering from cystic fibrosis were colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As already observed, the mucins from the patients with cystic fibrosis had a higher sulfate content than the mucins from the patients with chronic bronchitis. However, there was a striking increase in the sialic acid content of the mucins secreted by severely infected patients as compared to noninfected patients. Thirty-six bronchial mucins out of 38 contained the sialyl-Lewis x epitope which was even expressed by subjects phenotyped as Lewis negative, indicating that at least one [alpha]1,3 fucosyltransferase different from the Lewis enzyme was involved in the biosynthesis of this epitope. Finally, the sialyl-Lewis x determinant was also overexpressed in the mucins from severely infected patients. Altogether these differences in the glycosylation process of mucins from infected and noninfected patients suggest that bacterial infection influences the expression of sialyltransferases and [alpha]1,3 fucosyltransferases in the human bronchial mucosa.'",2
"b'Animal lectins play important roles in a variety of biological processes via their recognition of glycoconjugates. Galectin-3 is a [beta]-galactoside-binding lectin whose expression is associated with various pathological processes including human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-infection of human T cell lines and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of T-lymphoblastic Molt-3 cell line. In the case of HIV-infected cells, it has been suggested that the increase in galectin-3 expression could be related to the expression of the viral regulatory gene tat. These results prompt us to perform more extensive analyses of the relationship between galectin-3 and HIV-1 Tat expressions. In this study, we found that Tat protein expression induces an upregulation of galectin-3 in several human cell lines. In co-transfection experiments, the 5[prime]-regulatory sequences of the galectin-3 gene were significantly upregulated by expression vectors encoding the Tat protein. Analysis performed with 5[prime]-regulatory deleted sequences suggested that galectin-3 induction by Tat is dependent on activation of the Sp-1 binding transcription factor.'",2
"b'We studied cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones expressing cytoplasmic domain-deleted CD3{delta} and CD3{gamma} chains. These cells retained efficient antigen-specific cytolysis. Because the cytoplasmic domains of native CD3{delta} and CD3{gamma} chains contain a dileucine-based and a tyrosine-based motif thought to be important for receptor endocytosis, we compared TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation on the CTL clones expressing or not these domains. We found that antigen-induced TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation was not dependent on either the CD3{delta} or CD3{gamma} cytoplasmic domains. This contrasts with phorbol ester- and anti-CD3 mAb (soluble or plastic-coated)-induced TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation, that are respectively dependent on CD3{gamma} and on either CD3{delta} or CD3{gamma} cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that differences may exist between the mechanisms of TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation in response to the three stimuli. TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation in response to antigen was demonstrated by confocal microscopy to be associated with TCR\xdf chain internalization, whether CD3{delta} and CD3{gamma} were native or truncated. Inhibition by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 of TCR\x96CD3 down-modulation in response to antigen was also similar whether CD3{delta} and CD3{gamma} cytoplasmic domains were present or not. These properties of receptor down-modulation are discussed with respect to the requirements for TCR engagement on antigen-presenting cells.'",4
"b'IL-10 is a well-known immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory cytokine. However, we report in vitro experimental studies in which IL-10 primed leukocytes and led to an enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) upon further stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) prepared from whole blood maintained for 20 h at 37\xb0C in the presence of recombinant human IL-10 had an enhanced capacity to produce TNF in response to LPS. In addition to TNF, LPS-induced IL-6 and spontaneous IL-1ra production were also enhanced. When isolated PBMC were first cultured for 20 h in the presence of IL-10 on Teflon to prevent adherence, washed to remove IL-10 and then further cultured in plastic dishes for an additional 20 h in the presence of LPS or IL-1\xdf, an enhanced release of TNF was observed. This was not the case when PBMC were pre-cultured in plastic multidishes in the presence of IL-10. TNF mRNA expression induced by LPS was decreased when the pre-treatment of PBMC with IL-10 was performed on plastic, whereas this was not the case when cells were pre-cultured with IL-10 on Teflon. Furthermore, NF{kappa}B translocation following LPS activation was higher after IL-10 pre-treatment on Teflon than on plastic. Interestingly, an enhanced frequency of CD16 and CD68+ cells among the CD14+ cells was observed in the presence of IL-10, independently of the pre-culture conditions of the PBMC. Altogether, these results indicate that the IL-10-induced up-regulation of cytokine production depends on the prevention of monocyte adherence by red cells in the whole blood assays or by cultures of PBMC on Teflon. In contrast, the adherence parameter has no effect on the IL-10-induced modulation of some monocyte surface markers.'",4
"b""High attrition rates seriously threaten the validity of follow-up studies of criminal justice populations. This study examines attrition from a follow-up study of drink-driving offenders referred 5 years earlier to a screening programme. The aim of the study was to determine which factors are most closely associated with: (1) inability to locate subjects, (2) subjects' refusal to participate; (3) the manner in which subjects refuse. Logistic regression models compared the following groups of subjects: located vs not located; interviewed vs not interviewed; type of refusal (direct vs indirect). Independent variables included gender, age group, ethnicity, whether the subject had a telephone, compliance with and completion of the screening programme, alcohol dependence or abuse diagnosis vs no diagnosis, breath-alcohol level (BAL) at the time of arrest, and whether the subject had an outstanding arrest warrant. Some factors (younger age, screening compliance, Mexican national ethnicity, and having an outstanding arrest warrant) predicted both inability to locate and type of refusal. Hispanic ethnicity and having a telephone predicted better success with locating subjects. Among refusers, non-Hispanic whites were more likely than other ethnic groups to refuse directly, and those with warrants were more likely to refuse indirectly. Non-compliance with the screening programme was also associated with differential follow-up rates. Neither arrest BAL nor alcohol diagnoses was associated with differential rates of follow-up. We conclude that alcohol diagnosis does not appear to influence successful follow-up in this criminal justice population. Rather, tracking and interviewing challenges differed among ethnic groups, suggesting a need for culturally sensitive recruitment strategies in these populations.""",0
"b'Using single and multiunit recordings in the striate cortex of alert macaque monkeys, we find that gamma-band (20\x9670 Hz) oscillations in neuronal firing are a prominent feature of V1 neuronal activity. The properties of this rhythmic activity are very similar to those previously observed in the cat. Gamma-band activity is strongly dependent on visual stimulation, largely absent during spontaneous activity and, under the conditions of our experiment, not time-locked to the vertical refresh of the computer monitor (80 Hz) used to present the stimuli. In our sample, 61% of multiunit activity (MUA) and 46% of single-unit activity (SUA) was significantly oscillatory, with mean frequencies of 48 \xb1 9 and 42 \xb1 13 Hz, respectively. Gamma-band activity was most likely to occur when cells were activated by their optimal stimuli, but still occurred, although less often and with lower amplitude, in response to nonoptimal stimuli. The frequency of gamma-band activity also reflected stimulus properties, with drifting gratings evoking higher-frequency oscillations than stationary gratings. As in the cat, the spike trains of single cells showing gamma-band oscillations often displayed a pattern of repetitive burst firing, with intraburst firing rates of 300\x96800 Hz. The overall similarity of rhythmic neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys suggests that the phenomenon is not species-specific. The stimulus-dependence of the rhythmic activity is consistent with a functional role in visual perception.'",1
"b'Human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors show a time-dependent differentiation into macrophages upon in vitro cultivation, closely mimicking their in vivo migration and maturation into extravascular tissues. The mediator(s) of this maturation process has not been yet defined. We investigated the involvement of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors in this phenomenon and reported the specific, time-dependent, activation of STAT1 protein starting at day 0/1 of cultivation and maximally expressed at day 5. STAT1 activity was evident on the STAT binding sequences (SBE) present in the promoters of genes which are up-regulated during monocyte to macrophage maturation such as Fc{gamma}RI and ICAM-1, and in the promoter of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1. Moreover, the effect of cell adhesion to fibronectin or laminin was studied to investigate mechanisms involved in STAT1 activation. Compared with monocytes adherent on plastic surfaces, freshly isolated cells allowed to adhere either to fibronectin- or laminin-coated flasks exhibited an increased STAT1 binding activity both in control and in IFN-{gamma}-treated cells. The molecular events leading to enhanced STAT1 activation and cytokine responsiveness concerned both Y701 and S727 STAT1 phosphorylation. Exogenous addition of transforming growth factor-\xdf, which exerts an inhibitory effect on some monocytic differentiation markers, inhibited macrophage maturation, integrin expression and STAT1 binding activity. Taken together these results indicate that STAT1 plays a pivotal role in the differentiation/maturation process of monocytes as an early transcription factor initially activated by adherence and then able to modulate the expression of functional genes, such as ICAM-1 and Fc{gamma}RI.'",4
"b'Disruption of a neural system supporting goal-directed action gives rise to lapses of intention in healthy individuals and disorganized behavior in patients with prefrontal lesions. Evidence from behavioral studies indicates that the occurrence of lapses in selective attention, working memory and prospective memory tasks is transient in nature. In the current study, we used event-related brain potentials to demonstrate that lapses are associated with a slow wave over the frontal region that begins well before stimulus onset and lasts for several hundred milliseconds. The magnitude of this slow wave was modulated by task demands, indicating that attentional processes can be flexibly allocated in the service of goal-directed action. Together the findings of these experiments indicate that lapses result from a transient inability to bring to bear the goals of the individual upon the action selection system.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Several cell adhesion molecules that mediate the binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules (HEV) from flowing blood have been identified but the regulation of lymphocyte migration across the HEV wall into the lymph node (LN) is far from understood. In this study we have used an in vitro model of lymphocyte migration across HEV, and analysed the roles of two integrins in the binding and transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes and T lymphoblasts. The adhesion of T lymphocytes to high endothelial cells (HEC) cultured from rat LN HEV differed from that of T lymphoblasts since the percentage of T lymphoblasts that adhered and transmigrated was higher and was not increased by IFN-{gamma} pretreatment of HEC. Antibodies to {alpha}4 integrins, VCAM-1 or LFA-1 maximally inhibited T lymphocyte adhesion by 40\x9650%, whereas antibodies to ICAM-1 were less effective (<20% inhibition). The effects of {alpha}4 integrin and LFA-1 antibodies were additive, giving >90% inhibition. T lymphocytes which adhered in the presence of LFA-1 antibody showed reduced levels of transmigration and, in the presence of {alpha}4 integrin antibody, slightly increased transmigration. Antibodies to {alpha}4 integrins, VCAM-1, LFA-1 or ICAM-1 had little effect on T lymphoblast adhesion (maxima of 10\x9630% inhibition) and T lymphoblasts transmigrated normally in the presence of either {alpha}4 integrin or LFA-1 antibodies. However, the effects of {alpha}4 integrin and LFA-1 antibodies on T lymphoblast adhesion were synergistic, giving >90% inhibition of adhesion. These results suggest that the majority of T lymphoblasts use either {alpha}4 integrins or LFA-1 to bind and transmigrate HEV, and the roles of these integrins on activated T cells are overlapping and redundant. In contrast, either integrin supports half-maximal binding of unactivated T lymphocytes to the surface of HEV and LFA-1 makes a larger contribution than {alpha}4 integrins to transendothelial migration.'",4
"b'Using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique, we isolated a novel kinase, IKK-i, whose message is drastically induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. The predicted protein contains the kinase domain in its N-terminus, which shares 30% identity to that of IKK-{alpha} or IKK-\xdf. The C-terminal portion contains a leucine zipper and a potential helix-loop-helix domain, as in the case of IKK-{alpha} and IKK-\xdf. IKK-i is expressed mainly in immune cells, and is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}, IL-1 and IL-6, in addition to LPS. Overexpression of wild-type IKK-i phosphorylated serine residues Ser32 and Ser36 of I{kappa}B-{alpha} (preferentially Ser36), and significantly stimulated NF-{kappa}B activation. These results suggest that IKK-i is an inducible I{kappa}B kinase which may play a special role in the immune response.'",4
"b'Background Good maps of malaria risk have long been recognized as an important tool for malaria control. The production of such maps relies on modelling to predict the risk for most of the map, with actual observations of malaria prevalence usually only known at a limited number of specific locations. Estimation is complicated by the fact that there is often local variation of risk that cannot be accounted for by the known covariates and because data points of measured malaria prevalence are not evenly or randomly spread across the area to be mapped.\r\n\r\nMethod We describe, by way of an example, a simple two-stage procedure for producing maps of predicted risk: we use logistic regression modelling to determine approximate risk on a larger scale and we employ geo-statistical (\x91kriging\x92) approaches to improve prediction at a local level. Malaria prevalence in children under 10 was modelled using climatic, population and topographic variables as potential predictors. After the regression analysis, spatial dependence of the model residuals was investigated. Kriging on the residuals was used to model local variation in malaria risk over and above that which is predicted by the regression model.\r\n\r\nResults The method is illustrated by a map showing the improvement of risk prediction brought about by the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach are discussed in the context of the need for further development of methodology and software.'",3
"b'Alloreactive T cells form an important barrier for organ transplantation. To reduce the risk of rejection patients are given immunosuppressive drugs, which increase the chance of infection and the incidence of malignancies. It has been shown that a large proportion of alloreactive T cells specifically recognize peptides present in the groove of the allogeneic MHC molecule. This implies that it might be possible to modulate the alloresponse by peptides with antagonistic properties, thus preventing rejection without the side effects of general immunosuppression. Peptide antagonists can be designed on the basis of the original agonist, yet for alloreactive T cells these agonists are usually unknown. In this study we have used a dedicated synthetic peptide library to identify agonists for HLA-DR3-specific alloreactive T cell clones. Based on these agonists, altered peptide ligands (APL) were designed. Three APL could antagonize an alloreactive T cell clone in its response against the library-derived agonist as well as in its response against the original allodeterminant, HLA-DR3. This demonstrates that peptide libraries can be used to design antagonists for alloreactive T cells without knowledge about the nature of the actual allostimulatory peptide. Since the most potent agonists are selected, this strategy permits detection of potent antagonists. The results, however, also suggest that the degree of peptide dependency of alloreactive T cell clones may dictate whether a peptide antagonist can be found for such clones. Whether peptide antagonists will be valuable in the development of donor\x96patient-specific immunosuppression may therefore depend on the specificity of the in vivo-generated alloreactive T cells.'",4
"b'Acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, has been shown to be capable of binding covalently to liver proteins in vivo, which may be responsible for a variety of toxic effects of ethanol. Acetaldehyde\x96protein adducts have previously been detected in the liver of patients and experimental animals with alcoholic liver disease. Although a role for acetaldehyde as a possible mediator of ethanol-induced neurotoxicity has also been previously suggested, the formation of protein\x96acetaldehyde adducts in brain has not been examined. This study was designed to examine the occurrence of acetaldehyde\x96protein adducts in rat brain after lifelong ethanol exposure. A total of 27 male rats from the alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) lines were used. Four ANA rats and five AA rats were fed 10\x9612% (v/v) ethanol for 21 months. Both young (n = 10) and old (n = 8) rats receiving water were used as controls. Samples from frontal cortex, cerebellum and liver were processed for immunohistochemical detection of acetaldehyde adducts. In four (two ANA, two AA rats) of the nine ethanol-exposed rats, weak or moderate positive reactions for acetaldehyde adducts could be detected both in the frontal cortex and cerebellum, whereas no such immunostaining was found in the remaining five ethanol-treated rats or in the control rats. The positive reaction was localized to the white matter and some large neurons in layers 4 and 5 of the frontal cortex, and to the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Interestingly, the strongest positive reactions were found among the ANA rats, which are known to display high acetaldehyde levels during ethanol oxidation. We suggest that acetaldehyde may be involved in ethanol-induced neurotoxicity in vivo through formation of adducts with brain proteins and macromolecules.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Much has been written concerning the \x91epidemiological enigma\x92 of falling gastric cancer rates in the US. Up until the 1930s gastric cancer was the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US.1 Today it is eighth. This sharp decline during the 20th century remains an unexplained yet startling phenomenon.2 The leading theories to explain this change concern the advent of refrigeration and infection with Helicobacter pylori. Refrigeration began in the early 1900s and gained widespread use by the 1950s. As a result the US diet began to include more fresh fruits and vegetables (high in anti-carcinogenic anti-oxidants) and less preserved meats (high in nitrites and carcinogenic nitrosamines).3 The temporal correlation between refrigeration and gastric cancer rates, however, has not held true for countries such as Japan, where widespread refrigeration noted in the 1960s has not resulted in a gastric cancer decrease. Infection with H. pylori.4 is currently regarded as the main contender to explain the enigma and studies have demonstrated a causal link between H. pylori infection, chronic atrophic gastritis, and the intestinal type of gastric carcinoma.5 However, multifactorial causality is likely to be involved and other critical cofactors are yet to be identified.6\r\n\r\nThe role of dietary nitrite and N-nitrosamines in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer has remained a matter of debate for over 30 years.7 N-nitroso compounds are potent carcinogens in primate animal models and result in a variety of tumour types.8 Such carcinogenic nitrosamines can be formed from the reaction of nitrite with secondary amines under acidic conditions (such as occurs in the human stomach) as well as during the curing process used to preserve meats.9 Dietary sources of nitrosamines include US cured meats preserved with sodium nitrite as well as the dried salted fish eaten in Japan.10\r\n\r\nOne aspect of nutritional epidemiology that has received minimal attention in the medical literature concerns changes in US meat curing practices that occurred in the 1920s. Prior to 1923 the level of nitrite detectable in cured meats was extremely high and variable. During that time meat was cured using potassium nitrate (or saltpetre). The conversion of nitrate (NO3) to nitrite (NO2) by nitrate-reducing bacteria during the curing process was responsible for the levels of nitrite found in the meats.11 Nitrite levels as high as 1400 ppm (1 ppm equals 1 mg/kg) nitrite in frankfurters and up to 960 ppm in ham were noted at that time. The average content was 185 ppm.12 There was no regulation of the amount of nitrite permissible in cured meat products and the process produced inconsistent results in terms of meat colour and flavour. In the early 1900s it was realised that nitrite, and not nitrate, was responsible for the preservation and characteristic colour/flavour of the cured meats. In 1923 the Department of Agriculture authorized experimentation using sodium nitrite (instead of nitrate) to cure meats. The experiments were deemed a success and resulted in the formal authorization of sodium nitrite as a meat curing compound. A 200 ppm maximal nitrite concentration was established and the use of nitrate for curing was discouraged.13\r\n\r\nAs a result of this formal authorization in 1925, the amount of nitrite in cured meats was significantly reduced. By 1937 the average content had decreased to 56.7 ppm (i.e. a 326% reduction) and it has remained in this range.11 The effect that this nitrite reduction had on the nitrosamine content of the meats is not known since sophisticated analytical methods were not available. However, with such high nitrite levels present it is likely that high nitrosamine levels existed as well. Furthermore, since agents to prevent spontaneous nitrosamine formation (such as sodium ascorbate and sodium erythrobate) were not included in the meat curing process until the 1970s,13 it is reasonable to assume that cured meats of the early 1900s contained high nitrosamine levels.\r\n\r\nThe described change in US meat curing practice preceded the beginning of the gastric cancer incidence/mortality decline by about a decade. Examination of crude death rates from prior to 1930 shows that mortality from gastric cancer was increasing (US census data)1 and not until the 1930s did the rates begin their steep descent. This decline is noted simultaneously in the age-specific death rates of all age groups (by decades of life), supporting a calendar period effect.14 Decreased nitrosamine content of cured meats in the US beginning in 1925 could, in part, explain this epidemiological enigma. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn from this historical relationship, the information does support the existing evidence that dietary nitrite, through nitrosamine formation, plays a role in the pathogenesis of human gastric cancer. Examination of historical changes in nitrite meat curing practices in other countries with declining gastric cancer rates could yield similar findings.'",3
"b'Previous studies of visual search in humans using event-related potentials (ERPs) have revealed an ERP component called \x91N2pc\x92 (180\x96280 ms) that reflects the focusing of attention onto potential target items in the search array. The present study was designed to localize the neuroanatomical sources of this component by means of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, which provide greater spatial precision than ERP recordings. MEG recordings were obtained with an array of 148 magnetometers from six normal adult subjects, one of whom was tested in multiple sessions so that both single-subject and group analyses could be performed. Source localization procedures revealed that the N2pc is composed of two distinct neural responses, an early parietal source (180\x96200 ms) and a later occipito-temporal source (220\x96240 ms). These findings are consistent with the proposal that parietal areas are used to initiate a shift of attention within a visual search array and that the focusing of attention is implemented by extrastriate areas of the occipital and inferior temporal cortex.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""The mouse hippocampus is an attractive model system in which to study patterning of a cortical structure. Ongoing studies indicate that hippocampal areas or fields are specified many days before birth \x96 possibly involving signals from within the cortical mantle. Although the hippocampal CA fields are distinguished by cytoarchitecture only after birth, molecular differences between fields appear by late gestation. Moreover, these embryonic fields are already specified to develop additional features that characterize the mature fields. The basic division of the hippocampus into fields may be specified still earlier. Thus, if medial cortical neuroepithelium is isolated in vitro early in hippocampal neurogenesis, it can autonomously generate features of a patterned hippocampus. In vivo, the spatial progression of initial field differentiation suggests that signals regulating growth and patterning could arise from sources close to the hippocampal poles. Observations of mouse mutants indicate that the cortical hem, an embryonic structure close to one pole of the hippocampus, is a source of such regulatory signals.\r\n\r\nHow the developing cerebral cortex is patterned into functionally specialized areas has been primarily studied in neocortex (Rakic, 1988Go; Grove, 1993Go; Levitt et al., 1993Go; O'Leary et al., 1994Go; Gotz, 1995Go; McConnell, 1995Go; Levitt et al., 1997Go). We have focused instead on the patterning of another part of the cortical mantle, the archicortex or hippocampus (Grove et al., 1992Go; Tole et al., 1997Go; Tole and Grove, 1998Go). The hippocampus and neocortex are anatomically different types of cortex, but both are subdivided into areas or fields (Nauta and Feirtag, 1986Go), and, in the hippocampus, the normal development and function of each field may be critical to the overall role of the hippocampus in memory (Squire, 1987Go; Tsien et al., 1996Go).\r\n\r\nQuestions we are addressing include how the embryonic cortex is initially divided into neocortex and archicortex, and whether distinct mechanisms control the growth of the two types of cortex. When and how is the developing hippocampus subdivided into fields, and are the underlying mechanisms the same as those that regulate area division in the neocortex? Answers to these questions may reveal differences between hippocampus and neocortex, but may also disclose general principles underlying the assembly of any type of cortex.\r\n\r\nThe hippocampus is an attractive system for an investigation of patterning. First, the anatomy of the rat and mouse hippocampus is comparatively simple (Fig. 1Go). The single pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus is divided into only two major fields, CA1 and CA3, and a small transitional field, CA2. The CA fields are capped by the dentate gyrus, the third major field of the hippocampus. Second, for modern studies of embryonic pattern formation, molecular markers of specific regional cell types have been essential (Lumsden and Krumlauf, 1996Go; Tanabe and Jessell, 1996Go), and these are now available for the hippocampus. The hippocampal fields were defined in classical studies by differences in cytoarchitecture and connections (Lorente de No, 1934Go; Blackstad, 1956Go; Swanson and Cowan, 1977Go; Swanson et al., 1978Go), but the adult rodent CA fields and dentate gyrus also differentially express numerous macro-molecules (Frantz et al., 1994Go; He et al., 1989Go; Woodhams et al., 1989Go; Motro et al., 1991Go; Wisden and Seeburg, 1993Go; Herms et al., 1994Go; Breder et al., 1995Go; Schlingen et al., 1995Go; Ullrich et al., 1995Go). Some of these macromolecules can also be used as markers of specific regions in the developing mouse hippocampus (Tole et al., 1997Go) (S. Tole and E.A. Grove, in preparation). This panel of molecular markers makes possible a range of experiments that would be impractical if regional cell type was to be identified solely on the basis of morphological and connectional features. Molecular markers can be used to determine when hippocampal cells first show features of a CA1, CA3 or dentate cell identity, establishing an upper limit in terms of when field identity must be specified. Markers can also be used to determine the field identity of cells in tissue culture experiments designed to investigate the mechanisms of specification.

This cohort study looks at the relationship between alcohol consumption and long-term survival, adjusting for smoking habit and physical activity.\r\n\r\nMethods In 1965, a total of 1536 Italian males aged 45\x9665 years underwent an examination which included: a general questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, an overall physical examination, ECG recording, blood pressure and serum cholesterol measurements and measurement of food consumption including alcohol. The cohort was followed for total mortality from 1965 to 1995.\r\n\r\nResults During a period of 30 years 1096 deaths occurred. Age-adjusted life expectancy for men assuming a mean daily quantity of 63 g of alcohol (range 4\x967 drinks per day) was 21.6 \xb1 0.4 years, roughly 2 years more than men taking a mean quantity of 3.7 g (<=1 drink) and men consuming >10 drinks per day. Taking smoking habit into account, the longest survival of 22.4 \xb1 0.5 years was observed in non-smokers drinking 4\x967 drinks daily; the lowest, 18.5 \xb1 0.7 years, in smokers drinking >10 drinks. Stratifying for physical activity, the longest survival (23.4 \xb1 0.7 years) was experienced by men engaged in heavy physical activity at work drinking 1\x964 drinks per day.\r\n\r\nConclusions The relationship between life expectancy and alcohol consumption (97% wine in this Italian cohort and mostly red wine) is confirmed to be non-linear. Men aged 45\x9664 at entry drinking about 5 drinks per day have a longer life expectancy than occasional and heavy drinkers.'",3
"b'Clinical observation suggests that the aging process affects gyrification, with the brain appearing more \x91atrophic\x92 with increasing age. Empirical studies of tissue type indicate that gray matter volume decreases with age while cerebrospinal fluid increases. Quantitative changes in cortical surface characteristics such as sulcal and gyral shape have not been measured, however, due to difficulties in developing a method that separates abutting gyral crowns and opens up the sulci \x96 the \x91problem of buried cortex\x92. We describe a quantitative method for measuring brain surface characteristics that is reliable and valid. This method is used to define the gyral and sulcal characteristics of atrophic and non-atrophic brains and to examine changes that occur with aging in a sample of 148 normal individuals from a broad age range. The shape of gyri and sulci change significantly over time, with the gyri becoming more sharply and steeply curved, while the sulci become more flattened and less curved. Cortical thickness also decreases over time. Cortical thinning progresses more rapidly in males than in females. The progression of these changes appears to be relatively stable during midlife and to begin to progress some time during the fourth decade. Measurements of sulcal and gyral shape may be useful in studying the mechanisms of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative changes that occur during brain maturation and aging.'",1
"b""Background This study examined the recent nationwide trends for the absolute number and the age- and sex-specific incidence rates of the fatal and serious non-fatal injuries among 0\x9614 year old children in Finland in 1971\x961995.\r\n\r\nMethods We selected from Official Cause-of-Death Statistics and National Hospital Discharge Register children aged 0\x9614 years who died or required treatment at a hospital department because of an injury in 1971\x961995. The number of Finnish children was 1.1 million in 1971, and 1.0 million in 1995.\r\n\r\nResults During the entire study period injuries were the leading cause of death in children aged 1\x9614 years, but not in infants. However, in these years the incidence (per 100 000 people) of fatal injuries in Finnish children decreased considerably in all age groups and both sexes, in girls from 20.1 in 1971 to 4.6 in 1995, and in boys from 36.7 in 1971 to 9.3 in 1995. In 1995, 41% of all the injurious deaths among 0\x9614 year old Finnish children were motor vehicle accidents, 12% were drownings, and 24% intentional injuries. The overall number and incidence of serious non-fatal injuries among Finnish children showed no clear trend change in 1971\x961995. The mean hospitalization time of injured children shortened between 1971 and 1995, from 7.4 days to 2.7 days.\r\n\r\nConclusions We conclude that the number and incidence of fatal childhood injuries have decreased dramatically in Finland between 1971 and 1995. The reasons for this positive development are multifactorial, but improved traffic safety and trauma care are probably very important. In children's serious non-fatal injuries the development has not been so encouraging and therefore children's injury prevention should receive continuous intense attention.""",3
"b'Background The demography and pattern of disease of skeletal assemblages may not accurately reflect those of the living population of which they were once a part. The hypothesis tested here was that skeletons from a mass disaster would more closely approximate to a living population than those from a conventional cemetery.\r\n\r\nMethod Six hundred skeletons recovered from a Black Death plague pit in London were compared with 236 skeletons recovered from an overlying medieval cemetery. Age and sex were determined by standard anthropological means by a single observer and adjustments were made to correct for those skeletons for which either or both could not be established. An estimate of age structure of the living medieval population of London was made, using model life tables.\r\n\r\nResults The age and sex distribution and the pattern of disease in the Black Death skeletons did not differ substantially from those in the control group of skeletons. Both assemblages tended to overestimate the numbers in the younger age groups of the model population and underestimate the numbers in the oldest age group.\r\n\r\nConclusions On the evidence from this single site, a skeletal assemblage from a mass disaster does not provide a better representation of the living population from which it was derived than that from a conventional cemetery.'",3
"b""Presentation of antigen to T cells is generally restricted by MHC type but the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was thought to involve direct stimulation by dendritic cells (DC) of allogeneic T cells. However, here we showed that DC bearing allogeneic MHC class II acted synergistically with responder-type DC. Removal of residual DC from `purified' responder T cell populations was achieved using treatment with DC-specific antibody and complement. These DC-depleted cells showed a significantly reduced response to allogeneic DC which was restored by addition of DC syngeneic with responder T cells. The studies support the concept that a major component of the MLR is the secondary presentation of alloantigens acquired from stimulator DC by DC of responder type. To investigate the reasons why DC and not other cells stimulate an MLR, synergy between DC and other cell types was investigated. Synergy was found exclusively between DC; macrophages, B cells or L cells transfected with MHC class II molecules did not contribute. When allogeneic DC were mixed in culture, transfer of MHC molecules between DC was observed as assessed by flow cytometry. Freshly obtained cell-free supernatants from cultured DC contained MHC class II and stimulated primary allogeneic MLR. DC of responder type acquired allogeneic MHC molecules from the supernatants and stimulated proliferation in syngeneic T cells. The capacity of DC both to shed and to acquire MHC molecules may contribute to their potency in stimulating primary responses, and could explain why passenger DC within allografts provide a potent stimulus for graft rejection.""",4
"b""Trypanosoma cruzi is an obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite that causes Chagas' disease in humans. Although a fair amount is known about the biochemistry of certain trypanosomes, very little is known about the enzymic complement of synthesis and processing of glycoproteins and/or functions of the subcellular organelles in this parasite. There have been very few reports on the presence of acid and neutral hydrolases in Trypanosoma cruzi. Here we report the first purification and characterization of a neutral mannosidase from the epimastigote stage of Trypanosoma cruzi. The neutral mannosidase was purified nearly 800-fold with an 8% recovery to apparent homogeneity from a CHAPS extract of epimastigotes by the following procedures: (1) metal affinity chromatography on Co+2-Sepharose, (2) anion exchange, and (3) hydroxylapatite. The purified enzyme has a native molecular weight of 150-160 kDa and is apparently composed of two subunits of 76 kDa. The purified enzyme exhibits a broad pH profile with a maximum at pH 5.9-6.3. It is inhibited by swainsonine (Ki, 0.1 \xb5M), d-mannono-[part]-lactam (Ki, 20 \xb5M), kifunensine (Ki, 60\xb5M) but not significantly by deoxymannojirimycin. The enzyme is activated by Co2+ and Ni2+ and strongly inhibited by EDTA and Fe2+.The purified enzyme is active against p-nitrophenyl [alpha]-d-mannoside (km = 87 \xb5M). High-mannose Man9GlcNAc substrate was hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme to Man7GlcNAc at pH 6.1. The purified enzyme does not show activity against [alpha]1,3- or [alpha]1,6-linked mannose residues. Antibodies against the recently purified lysosomal [alpha]-mannosidase from T.cruzi did not react with the neutral mannosidase reported here.""",2
"b'The absence or low levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in humans result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by hypoplastic thymus, T lymphocyte depletion and autoimmunity. Deficiency of ADA causes increased levels of both intracellular and extracellular adenosine, although only the intracellular lymphotoxicity of accumulated adenosine is considered in the pathogenesis of ADA SCID. It is shown that extracellular but not intracellular adenosine selectively inhibits TCR-triggered up-regulation of activation markers and apoptotic events in thymocytes under conditions of ADA deficiency. The effects of intracellular adenosine are dissociated from effects of extracellular adenosine in experiments using an adenosine transporter blocker. We found that prevention of toxicity of intracellular adenosine led to survival of TCR-cross-linked thymocytes in long-term (4 days) assays, but it was not sufficient for normal T cell differentiation under conditions of inhibited ADA. Surviving TCR-cross-linked thymocytes had a non-activated phenotype due to extracellular adenosine-mediated, TCR-antagonizing signaling. Taken together the data suggest that both intracellular toxicity and signaling by extracellular adenosine may contribute to pathogenesis of ADA SCID. Accordingly, extracellular adenosine may act on thymocytes, which survived intracellular toxicity of adenosine during ADA deficiency by counteracting TCR signaling. This, in turn, could lead to failure of positive and negative selection of thymocytes, and to additional elimination of thymocytes or autoimmunity of surviving T cells.'",4
"b""Signals derived from antigen-presenting cells (APC) influence the functional differentiation of CD4+ T cells. We report here that Serrate1 (Jagged1), a ligand for the Notch1 receptor, may contribute to the differentiation of peripheral CD4+ T cells into either helper or regulatory cells. Our findings demonstrate that antigen presented by murine APC overexpressing human Serrate1 induces naive peripheral CD4+ T cells to become regulatory cells. These cells can inhibit primary and secondary immune responses, and transfer antigen-specific tolerance to recipient mice. Our results show that Notch signalling may help explain `linked' suppression in peripheral tolerance, whereby tolerance induced to one epitope encompasses all epitopes on that antigen during the course of an immune response.""",4
"b'During the past decade, renewed interest in medications to prevent relapse in alcoholics has yielded a number of promising candidates. Although two of these medications, naltrexone and acamprosate, are currently in clinical use in a number of countries, overall, their effectiveness appears to be limited. Disulfiram, the deterrent medication that was approved 50 years ago for the treatment of alcoholism, has not consistently been shown to be efficacious. However, since inadequate dosing and other modifiable factors may limit its deterrent effects, the identification of a more potent metabolite of disulfiram appears to warrant further evaluation. Studies of serotonergic agonists for treatment of alcoholism have also yielded inconsistent results. There is evidence, however, that subgroups of alcoholics may respond well to such medications, suggesting that treatment matching may enhance their efficacy. In addition, nalmefene, a compound with effects similar to naltrexone, as well as a sustained release formulation of naltrexone, may enhance the beneficial effects of opioid antagonist therapy. Despite these developments, much remains to be learned about the pharmacotherapy of alcoholism. The ongoing development and evaluation of novel medications should be given a high priority. However, such basic issues as the optimal dosing strategy and duration of treatment for existing therapies are not known. Similarly, combination therapy, involving either multiple medications or the combination of medication with specific psychotherapies, has not been well studied. The utility of specific pharmacotherapies in women, different ethnic/racial groups, adolescent and geriatric patients, and individuals with co-morbid alcohol and drug use disorders (including nicotine dependence) is also largely unknown, as is the appropriateness of medication therapy for treatment of early problem drinkers. The ultimate aim of these efforts is the development of algorithms for the pharmacological treatment of heavy drinking, which incorporate the characteristics of the patient and of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments with demonstrated efficacy. Although a general framework for such an effort currently exists, much detail is needed before it will be of widespread clinical value.'",0
"b'Cell lineage analysis in rodents has shown that the cerebral cortex is formed from both widespread and large radial clustered clones representing partly distinct lineages and producing differing cell types. Since previous cell lineage analysis of the ferret cortex using retroviral libraries showed that most neurons labeled at E33\x96E35 formed widespread clones, we determined whether clones labeled earlier in neurogenesis showed a greater tendency to form coherent radial clones. Clones labeled at E27\x96E29 occasionally consisted of widespread multineuron clones (13% of PCR-defined clones), but commonly consisted of small clusters of two to four neurons (65%). Moreover, 6/21 hemispheres contained a single, much larger (6\x96150 cells) radial cluster. Although large clusters were observed in 28% of experiments, they contained many neurons, accounting for 38% of retrovirally labeled cells. The large clusters showed at most few widely scattered sibling cells, either by histological analysis or by PCR analysis, suggesting that radial and widespread clones coexist but are lineally separate at early stages of corticogenesis. Coexistence of large radial and widespread neuronal clones appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cortical neurogenesis.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We found that human peripheral B and T cells differed in the surface expression of [alpha]2-6 sialylated type 2 chain glycans. In contrast to B cells, T cells expressed only sialoglycans with repeated N-acetyllactosamine (Gal\xdf1-4GlcNAc) disaccharides. This finding was based on the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies HB6, HB9 (CD24), HD66 (CDw76), FB21, and CRIS4 (CDw76) with the [alpha]2-6 sialylated model gangliosides IV6NeuAcnLc4Cer (2-6 SPG), VI6NeuAcnLc6Cer (2-6 SnHC), VIII6NeuAcnLc8Cer (2-6 SnOC), and X6NeuAcnLc10Cer (2-6 SnDC). We found that, in addition to their common requirement of an [alpha]2-6 bound terminal sialic acid for binding, the antibodies displayed preferences for the length of the carbohydrate backbones. Some of them bound mainly to 2-6 SPG with one N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) unit (HB9, HD66); others preferentially to 2-6 SnHC and 2-6 SnOC, with two and three LacNAc units, respectively (HB6 and FB21); and one of them exclusively to very polar [alpha]2-6 sialylated type 2 chain antigens (CRIS4) such as to 2-6 SnOC and even more polar gangliosides with three and more LacNAc units. These specificities could be correlated with the cellular binding of the antibodies as follows: whereas all antibodies bound to human CD 19 positive peripheral B cells, their reactivity with CD3 positive T cells was either nearly lacking (HD66, HB9), intermediate (about 65%: HB6, FB21) or strongly positive (CRIS4, 95%). Thus, the binding of the antibodies to 2-6 sialylated glycans with multiple lactosamine units appeared to determine their binding to T-cells.'",2
"b'Background Occupational exposures may increase the risk of exocrine pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to identify occupations that in Spain may be associated with such risk.\r\n\r\nMethods Incident cases of pancreatic cancer and hospital controls were prospectively identified and interviewed during their hospital stay. Occupational history was obtained by direct interview with the patient and was available for 164 (89%) of 185 pancreatic cancer cases and for 238 (90%) of 264 controls. Occupations were coded according to the Spanish version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988.\r\n\r\nResults A significant increased odds ratio (OR) was observed in men for \x91physical, chemistry and engineering science technicians\x92.

The increases in risk observed for women in agricultural and textile jobs, and for men in the manufacture of dyes and pigments may deserve further attention.'",3
"b'A 5-year, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) primary prevention study was conducted in Washington State to: (1) assess the feasibility of using a FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic as a centre for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women; (2) generate a comprehensive, lifetime profile of these women; (3) identify factors that have enhanced and/or hindered their ability to achieve abstinence. The results of this study are presented in two parts. Objective 1 is summarized in the preceding paper and objectives 2 and 3 are summarized here. Comprehensive interviews were conducted with 80 women, who had given birth to a child diagnosed with FAS, to document their sociodemographics, reproductive and family planning history, social and healthcare utilization patterns, adverse social experiences, social support network, alcohol use and treatment history, mental health, and intelligence quotient (IQ). These high-risk women were diverse in racial, educational and economic backgrounds, were often victims of abuse, and challenged by mental health issues. Despite their rather harsh psychosocial profile, many demonstrated the ability to overcome their alcohol dependence over time. Relative to the women who had not achieved abstinence, the women who had achieved abstinence had significantly higher IQs, higher household incomes, larger more satisfactory social support networks, were more likely to report a religious affiliation, and were more likely to be receiving mental health treatment for their mental health disorders. The rate of unintended pregnancies and alcohol-exposed pregnancies was substantial. Key barriers to achieving effective family planning were maternal alcohol and drug use, lack of access to birth control and lack of support by their partner to use birth control. A FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic can be used to identify women at high risk for producing children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this population could lead to measurable reductions in the incidence of FAS.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The impact of the strength and promiscuity of the self peptide\x96MHC class II interaction on susceptibility to autoimmune disease is uncertain. Here we studied allelic differences in the affinity of rat MHC class II molecules for myelin basic protein (MBP) peptides spanning from position 63 to 106. Predominantly peptides from this region are immunogenic in the rat and the MHC class II region determines if the response is disease promoting or disease protective. Strikingly, RT1.B (DQ-like) molecules showed much more allelic variation of MBP peptide binding than RT1.D (DR-like) molecules. Moderate to strong binding of particular MBP peptides correlated with their previously documented encephalitogenicity. Moreover, the differences in disease susceptibility to certain MBP peptides observed in the different rat strains were clearly reflected in the allelic diversity of the peptide binding profiles. In conclusion our findings demonstrate that disease-inducing stretches of MBP generally comprise good binding peptides.'",4
"b'In the present study, we have evaluated the apoptotic effect of soluble human MHC class I (sHLA-I) antigens on CD8+ T lymphocytes. sHLA-I antigens and \xdf2-microglobulin-free HLA class I heavy chains, isolated from serum, induced apoptosis on phytohemagglutinin-activated CD8+ T lymphocytes in autologous and allogeneic combinations. The extent of CD8+ T cell apoptosis depends on the degree of activation, time of incubation with sHLA-I antigens and amount of sHLA-I antigens added to the cultures. Apoptosis is induced by the interaction of Fas (CD95)+ cells with soluble Fas ligand which is released following binding of sHLA-I antigens to CD8 molecules. These results suggest that sHLA-I antigens may regulate immune responses by inducing apoptosis in activated CD8+ T cells.'",4
"b'Recent studies have shown that O-mannosyl glycans are present in several mammalian glycoproteins. Although knowledge on the functional roles of these glycans is accumulating, their biosynthetic pathways are poorly understood. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of a novel enzyme capable of forming GlcNAc{beta}1-2Man linkage, namely UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: O-linked mannose {beta}-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in the microsome fraction of newborn rat brains. The enzyme transfers GlcNAc to {beta}-linked mannose residues, and the formed linkage was confirmed to be {beta}1-2 on the basis of diplococcal {beta}-N-acetylhexosaminidase susceptibility and by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography. Its activity is linearly dependent on time, protein concentration, and substrate concentration and is enhanced in the presence of manganese ion. Its activity is not due to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: {alpha}-3-D-mannoside {beta}-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT-I) or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: {alpha}-6-D-mannoside {beta}-1,2-D-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT-II), which acts on the early steps of N-glycan biosynthesis, because GnT-I or GnT-II expressed in yeast cells did not show any GlcNAc transfer activity against a synthetic mannosyl peptide. Taken together, the results suggest that the GlcNAc transferase activity described here is relevant to the O-mannosyl glycan pathway in mammals.'",2
"b'Mice carrying a {gamma}2b transgene have been shown previously to be deficient in B cell development. In particular, a developmental block exists at the pre-B cell stage. The few B cells that develop all express endogenous \xb5 heavy chains. The phenotype suggests that {gamma}2b exerts a strong feedback inhibition on endogenous Ig gene rearrangement, but, unlike \xb5, cannot support further B cell development. In this study we have created hybrid transgenes between {gamma}2b and \xb5. Transgenic mice with a CH1 domain of \xb5, or both a CH1 and transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain of \xb5 replacing the respective domains of a {gamma}2b transgene, have the same B cell defect as {gamma}2b transgenic mice. Interestingly, the severity of the defect is correlated with the level of expression of the transgene, suggesting that the degree of feedback inhibition of Ig gene rearrangement depends on the level and timing of Ig production. Crossing the {gamma}2b/\xb5 transgenes into a Bcl-xL transgenic line allows immature {gamma}2b B cells to survive, but not to develop to maturity. Therefore, the missing function of \xb5 is not simply an anti-apoptotic effect.'",4
"b""The present study explored the reliability and validity of a Spanish version of the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ) (12-item short form) as it might be used for opportunistic intervention. The test has three scales to allocate patients to a stage of change: pre-contemplation (P), contemplation (C) or action (A). The RCQ was translated and back-translated prior to pilot administration to 15 patients. From two settings (a general hospital ward and a primary health care centre), 201 patients were identified as excessive drinkers on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Patients known to be alcohol-dependent and attending for alcohol-related reasons were excluded. Patients completed the RCQ. Test\x96retest reliability after 2 days was assessed in 35 patients. A components analysis was performed. Patients were classified on RCQ scores to a stage of change. Two experts separately interviewed the patients and made an allocation to stage of change, blind to the RCQ score. Test\x96retest reliability was good (P: r = 0.81; C: r = 0.87; A: r = 0.86). Within the three scales, RCQ items showed fair consistency in terms of Cronbach's alpha (P: 0.58, C: 0.75, A: 0.80). Component analysis showed that together the scales accounted for 57.4% of the variance. The experts agreed between themselves on patients' stage of change (weighted kappa 0.92) but much less with the stage of change according to RCQ (expert A, kappa = 0.44; expert B, kappa = 0.52). Omitting patients with low consumption did not improve internal reliability, and omitting those with low educational level who might have filled in the questionnaire wrongly did not improve internal reliability or agreement between RCQ and the experts. We conclude that the Spanish RCQ did not function efficiently in a population of opportunistically identified excessive drinkers.\r\n\r\n""",0

"b'The aggregation of receptors with high affinity for IgE (Fc{epsilon}RI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils initiates a chain of biochemical events culminating in the release of allergy mediators. Although microtubules have been implicated in the activation process, the molecular mechanism of their interactions with signal transduction molecules is poorly understood. Here we show that in rat basophilic leukemia cells large amounts of {alpha}\xdf-tubulin dimers (~70%) and {gamma}-tubulin (~85%) are found in a soluble pool which was released from the cells after permeabilization with saponin, or extraction with non-ionic detergents. Soluble tubulins were found in large complexes with other molecules. Complexes of soluble {gamma}-tubulin released from activated cells contained tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of relative mol. wt ~25, 50, 53, 56, 60, 75, 80, 97, 115 and 200 kDa. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, i.e. around centrosomes, was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. In vitro kinase assays revealed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in {gamma}-tubulin complexes isolated from activated cells. Two of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in these complexes were identified as the p53/56lyn kinase. Furthermore, {gamma}-tubulin bound to the N-terminal fragment of recombinant Lyn kinase and its binding was slightly enhanced in activated cells. Pretreatment of the cells with Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP1, decreased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in {gamma}-tubulin complexes, as well as the amount of {gamma}-tubulin in Lyn kinase immunocomplexes. The combined data suggest that {gamma}-tubulin is involved in early stages of mast cell activation.'",4
"b'The mechanism underlying ethanol-induced apoptosis in liver cells is not clear. Sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism is a novel signal transduction pathway that has an impact on apoptosis in many cell types. We investigated whether the SM pathway is involved in ethanol-induced apoptosis in the liver. Hep G2 cells were treated with ethanol followed by assaying apoptosis, sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity, caspase-3 activity, and the changes of SM content in the cells. We found that ethanol dose-dependently increased apoptosis and the effect was accompanied by increases of caspase-3 activity and neutral SMase activity. At concentrations of 80 and 160 mM, ethanol significantly increased caspase-3 activity by 120% and neutral SMase activity by 24%. The activity of acid SMase was only slightly increased without statistical significance. C2-ceramide, the exogenous SM metabolite, mimicked the effects of ethanol on apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. When the SM content was determined 24 h after treatment with ethanol, its level was 15% lower than that of controls. The results indicate that metabolism of SM triggered by neutral SMase participates in ethanol-induced apoptosis in Hep G2 cells and activation of caspase-3 is involved in the apoptotic pathway.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""The present study investigated the effect of acute intragastric (i.g.) administration of dry Hypericum perforatum extract (HPE), containing 0.3% hypericin, on ethanol intake in genetically selected Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats. The i.g. administration of HPE, 125 or 250 mg/kg, induced a 30\x9640% reduction in ethanol intake in rats offered 10% (v/v) ethanol for 2 h/day. The effect of these doses was selective, since they modified neither food intake nor food-associated drinking; neither did the same doses modify the rat's gross behaviour in the open-field test. A dose of 500 mg/kg frequently induced immobility and a general suppression of ingestive behaviour. In rats offered 10% ethanol for 12 h/ day, ethanol intake following treatment with 250 mg/kg HPE was significantly lower than that of controls for up to 10 h. The effect on ethanol intake was not related to the antidepressant-like effect of HPE revealed in the forced swimming test. In this regard, the effect on ethanol intake was observed after a single administration of 125 mg/kg, whereas the antidepressant effect was observed only after repeated treatment with doses higher than 125 mg/kg HPE. The i.g. administration of HPE, 250 mg/kg, did not affect blood-alcohol levels following i.g. treatment with 0.7 g/kg ethanol, the amount usually ingested in a single drinking episode; thus, the effect is not related to changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethanol. The present study shows that HPE markedly reduces ethanol intake in msP rats, without significantly modifying food intake.\r\n\r\n""",0

So overall, there is a highly significant trend in these data, suggesting that paternal exposure to metal fumes is associated in a dose-related fashion with the production of excess daughters.\r\n\r\nThe authors mention two alternatives in this context, viz that\r\n\r\nexposure alters men's hormone profiles, and that\x97in accordance with my hypothesis2\x97these directly affect the sex ratio at conception, and \r\nexposed men somehow cause their wives to have male-biased spontaneous abortions. \r\nIn the context of my hypothesis, the authors mention that Bonde et al.3 reported poor semen and low fertility in welders, but no low offspring sex ratio. I should emphasize that ex hypothesi offspring sex ratio is to be regarded as a marker for unusual (pathological) hormone profiles\x97not as a marker for abnormal levels of individual hormones. Jacobsen et al.4 reported a normal sex ratio in the offspring of men ascertained at a sperm analysis clinic. So if offspring sex ratio is considered as a test, it will sometimes (as in the data of Bonde et al.3) give a false negative result, but it has not (to my knowledge) been reported to give a false positive one. In other words an unusual sex ratio may be presumed indicative of parental hormone imbalance: whereas a normal sex ratio may exist in spite of parental endocrine pathology (e.g. overall high or low hormone levels). The rationale for using offspring sex ratio as a marker for endocrine pathology is that it is useful, rapid and non-invasive; it may reflect the effects of low-level, long-term exposure; and ex hypothesi, it may be a permanent witness to hormone imbalance many years in the past. It is not a substitute for invasive testing (e.g. of sperm or endocrines) but may sometimes suggest that such procedures would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nI should like to suggest that the authors follow up their alternatives elaborated above by considering the following questions:\r\n\r\nDo the exposed men have\x97as I would hypothesize\x97low T/G ratios (where T and G are respectively a man's standardized testosterone and gonadotrophin levels)? If these data are not immediately available, I suggest that hormone assays would now be justified (at least of the founders). An explanation of the founders' unusual offspring sex ratio is now needed. Is it indicative of serious reproductive hazard? \r\nDo the wives of exposed men (particularly founders) report a high incidence of spontaneous abortion? If so, is there a dose-related association between the incidence of abortion and level of exposure? """,3
"b""Single-neuron recordings from behaving primates have established a link between working memory processes and information-specific neuronal persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex. Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331\x96349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.""",1
"b'A central tenet of vaccine development is to identify immune correlates of protection. Both plasmid-encoded gD as well as recombinant protein gD can protect mice from lethal herpes simplex virus (HSV) challenge. It is known that different vaccine modalities should induce different immune phenotypes. Yet, paradoxically, it is also thought that the basis for protection should rely on exploitation of vulnerabilities of the pathogen and therefore that the overlapping properties of these different vaccines would reveal insight into common immune mechanisms responsible for protection. We sought to investigate this question by comparing two different vaccine modalities in the HSV-2 mouse model. We observed that gD protein was a strong inducer of Th2-type immune responses, and overall antibody titers of IgG, IgE and IgA were significantly higher than those induced by plasmid gD vaccines. In contrast, the plasmid gD vaccine induced a strong Th1 bias. Following high-dose challenge the gD protein was most effective at providing protection. However, at lower lethal dose challenge, while both vaccines were protective with regards to survival, only the plasmid-vaccinated animals were protected from HSV-2 infection-induced morbidity. These studies suggest that these different vaccine modalities induce protection through unique non-overlapping mechanisms, supporting that vaccine correlates are associated with the types of immunogen rather than solely the pathogen.'",4
"b""Background Cross-national comparisons of injury mortality can suggest possible causal explanations for injuries across different countries and cultures. This study identifies differences in injury mortality between Los Angeles (LA) County, California and Mexico City DF, Mexico.\r\n\r\nMethods Using LA County and Mexico City death certificate data for 1994 and 1995, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision\x97Clinical Modification external cause of injury codes. Crude, gender-, and age-adjusted annual fatality rates were calculated and comparisons were made between the two regions.\r\n\r\nResults Overall and age-adjusted injury death rates were higher for Mexico City than for LA County. Injury death rates were found to be higher for young adults in LA County and for elderly residents of Mexico City. Death rates for motor vehicle crashes, falls, and undetermined causes were higher in Mexico City, and relatively high rates of poisoning, homicide, and suicide were found for LA County. Motor vehicle crash and fall death rates in Mexico City increased beginning at about age 55, while homicide death rates were dramatically higher among young adults in LA County. The largest proportion of motor vehicle crash deaths was to motor vehicle occupants in LA County and to pedestrians in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings illustrate the importance of primary injury prevention in countries having underdeveloped trauma care systems and should aid in setting priorities for future work. The high frequency of pedestrian fatalities in Mexico City may be related to migration of rural populations, differing vehicle characteristics and traffic patterns, and lack of safety knowledge. Mexico City's higher rate of fall-related deaths may be due to concurrent morbidity from chronic conditions, high-risk environments, and delay in seeking medical treatment.""",3
"b'Kdn (3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid), a unique deaminated member of the sialic acid family, has emerged as a new building block of glycoconjugates from a wide variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals. In particular, the presence of Kdn has been demonstrated in different rat organs and tissues, but not in liver. Here we report on the detection and quantitation of Kdn in rat liver and on its variations with postnatal development and aging. We have previously established the optimal conditions for derivatization of Kdn with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), and detection by reverse-phase HPLC. Analysis of whole liver homogenates and different subcellular fractions reveals that Kdn is fundamentally present in the cytosolic fraction as nucleotide precursor. The expression of Kdn, Neu5Gc, and Neu5Ac changes unevenly with age. While the content of Neu5Ac, the major species, and Neu5Gc decreases to a different extent from newborn to old animals, Kdn content decreases from newborn to trace amounts in adult rats and increases again with aging. Thus, expression of Kdn, Neu5Gc, and Neu5Ac appears to be independently regulated.'",2
"b'At what levels of brain organization might pathological change in schizophrenia be anatomically expressed: global, regional or supra-regional? We hypothesised that brain structure reflects a set of supra-regional anatomical systems with common developmental influences. We conducted an exploratory analysis to identify supra-regional brain systems and to investigate whether abnormal brain architecture in schizophrenia is manifested within one or more of these systems. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired from 27 patients with schizophrenia and 37 control subjects. After segmentation and registration of each individual MRI dataset in the standard space of Talairach and Tournoux, grey matter and ventricular-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps were automatically parcellated into 104 regions. We used principal components analysis of the multiple regional grey matter and ventricular-CSF measurements, on all 64 subjects, to extract the five main normative supra-regional systems. The first two of these components represented global variation in grey matter and ventricular-CSF regional measures. We interpreted the other three components as representing supra-regional systems comprising: a frontal\x96parietal system, a frontal\x96temporal system and a frontal\x96basal ganglia system. Schizophrenic group mean scores on the first component (global grey matter\x96ventricular contrast) and fourth component (frontal\x96temporal system) were significantly reduced compared to controls. These results suggest that pathological change in schizophrenia may be expressed at two mutually independent levels of anatomical organization: global change in a grey matter/ventricular system and supra-regional change in a frontal\x96temporal system.'",1
"b'RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNAs by single murine CD4+ T cells activated either in a strongly type 1-polarized mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) or in the type 2-polarized response to immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in alum. The frequencies of expression of each cytokine differed markedly between the two responses, consistent with their polarization at the population level. However, most cells expressed only none to three of the six cytokines assayed, few displayed the canonical type 1 profile and none in either response expressed a full type 2 or type 0 profile. A significant fraction of cells co-expressed IFN-{gamma} with IL-4 and/or other type 2 cytokines at frequencies that suggested that most of these genes were independently regulated. Collectively, these single-cell expression patterns indicate that polarization at the population level can mask substantial intercellular heterogeneity, and show directly that multiple type 1 and 2 cytokines can be expressed simultaneously in an individual T cell.'",4
"b'Surface immunolabeling was used together with membrane potential and/or Ca2+ indicator dyes to characterize physiological properties emerging among precursors, neuroglial progenitors and differentiating neurons during neurogenesis of embryonic rat neocortex. Cells were immunoidentified with tetanus toxin (TnTx), which binds to gangliosides expressed by neurons, and anti-A2B5, which reacts with gangliosides expressed by neuroglial progenitors. Microdissection of the neocortex into ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) and cortical plate/subplate (CP/SP) regions further resolved the TnTx/A2B5-immunoidentified cells into pre- and post-migratory subpopulations. Quantitative immunocytochemistry revealed mainly proliferative (BrdU+) and immature (nestin+) elements among TnTx\x96A2B5\x96 precursors and TnTx\x96A2B5+ progenitors in the VZ/SVZ, and the appearance of neuron-specific antigens among post-mitotic TnTx+ subpopulations of the CP/SP. Flow cytometry of acutely prepared cells in suspension and dual-imaging of cells in culture revealed that ionotropic amino acid receptors and metabotropic acetylcholine receptors closely paralleled the emergence of voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels and Na+\x96Ca2+ exchange activity among TnTx+ neuronal progenitors migrating from VZ/SVZ to CP/SP. During this period, TnTx\x96A2B5\x96 precursors and TnTx\x96A2B5+ neuroglial progenitors from VZ/SVZ predominantly exhibited Ca2+ responses to ATP. Thus, stereotypical and contrasting physiologies emerge among embryonic cortical cells in vivo as they initially progress from proliferating precursors and progenitors along neuronal and glial cell lineages.'",1
"b'Although CD8+ T cells are supposed to play an important role in protective immunity to mycobacteria, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in this infection remain poorly characterized. We previously demonstrated that bacillus Calmette-Gu\xe9rin (BCG) immunization of H-2b mice induced CTL able to recognize and kill macrophages incubated with proteins from mycobacterial culture supernatant [culture filtrate (CF) antigens]. In the present study, we have further characterized the lytic activity of these CTL and the processing pathway used for the presentation of CF proteins. We show that they use the degranulation pathway (secretion of perforins and granzymes) as the main lytic mechanism of cytotoxicity and also secrete IFN-{gamma} upon incubation with CF-pulsed macrophages. The in vitro presentation of CF proteins to CTL required a processing step inhibited in the cold but insensitive to Brefeldin A. Transporter-associated protein (TAP)-2-deficient RMA-S cells were efficiently recognized and killed by CF-specific CTL, demonstrating the lack of TAP requirement for this presentation. However, recognition of target cells by CTL was abolished when carried out in the presence of chloroquine. These results indicate that a non-classical MHC class I-processing pathway allows the recognition of a CF protein by CTL in BCG-vaccinated H-2b mice.'",4
"b'Background Mammographic parenchymal patterns are of particular interest because the denser patterns reduce screening sensitivity as well as increasing breast cancer risk, and because they have been shown to be affected by exogenous oestrogens.\r\n\r\nMethods We designed a case-control study comprising 200 cases with high-risk (P2 and DY) pattern and 200 controls with low-risk (N1 and P1) pattern. Mammograms were evaluated according to the Wolfe classification.\r\n\r\nResults Parity, body mass index (BMI) and current smoking were inversely and independently associated, whereas late age of menarche and history of benign breast disease were positively associated with high-risk mammographic patterns. Current-users of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) were more than twice as likely to have a high-risk pattern than never-users (OR = 2.48, 95% CI : 1.32\x964.61). Women who used HRT for more than 5 years were almost three times more likely to have a high-risk pattern than never-users (OR = 2.77, 95% CI : 1.11\x966.91). Relative to never-users, women who started HRT before the menopause were more than twice as likely to have a high-risk pattern (OR = 2.53, 95% CI : 1.31\x964.87).\r\n\r\nConclusions Careful clinical and mammographical follow-up might be appropriate in women undergoing HRT. The HRT-induced mammographic pattern might be regarded as a new baseline and changes with respect to this new pattern could then be monitored over time.'",3
"b'Many tissues contain glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which are substituted with N-or O-linked keratan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan in which the lactosamine (-gal\xdf1,4glcNAc-) disaccharide backbone is variably modified by sulfation, fucosylation, and sialylation. We report here a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative procedure for obtaining a complete disaccharide compositional analyses for keratan sulfates after FACE separation of products generated by hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycans with B. fragillis keratanase II and E. freundii endo-\xdf-galactosidase. Seven digestion end products are separable in a single electrophoretic step using Monosaccharide\x91 composition gels. These are: the unsulfated disaccharide, glcNAc\xdf1,3gal, the fucosylated trisaccharide, gal\xdf1,2[fuc{alpha}1,3]glcNAc6S, the mono- and disulfated disaccharides, gal\xdf1,4glcNAc6S or gal6S\xdf1,4glcNAc6S from the chain interior, and the sialylated mono- and disulfated trisaccharides neuA{alpha}2,3gal\xdf1,4glcNAc6S or neuA{alpha}2,3gal6S\xdf1,4glcNAc6S from the nonreducing terminus. FACE analyses also revealed the presence of a contaminant \xdf-galactosidase activity in keratanase II enzyme preparations which cleaves the disaccharide, gal\xdf1,4glcNAc6S to its constituent monosaccharides, gal and glcNAc6S. It was particularly prominent at enzyme concentrations > 2 mU per nmole substrate glcNH2 or after prolonged digestion times (> 12 h), and was not inhibitable by thiogalactosides or N-acetyl-lactosamine. As these monosaccharide products would not be detectable using the commonly described analytical methods for KS hydrolase products, such as 1H-NMR and HPLC analyses, our data illustrate that the FACE procedure represents an improved approach for accurate compositional microanalyses of corneal and skeletal keratan sulfates, especially applicable to experimentation involving small amounts (1\x962 \xb5g) of this glycosaminoglycan.'",2
"b'Several studies showed that Sf-9 cells can synthesize the galactosylated N-linked oligosaccharides if \xdf-1,4-galactosyltransferase (\xdf-1,4-GalT) is supplied. The full-length human \xdf-1,4-GalT I, II, III, IV, V, and VI cDNAs were independently transfected into Sf-9 cells, and the galactosylation of endogenous membrane glycoproteins was examined by lectin blot analysis using Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I), which preferentially interacts with oligosaccharides terminated with Gal\xdf1->4GlcNAc group. Several RCA-I-reactive bands appeared in all of the gene-transfected cells, and disappeared on treatment of blots with \xdf-1,4-galactosidase or N-glycanase prior to incubation with lectin. Introduction of the antisense \xdf-1,4-GalT II and V cDNAs separately into human colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480 cells, in which \xdf-1,4-GalT I, II, and V genes were expressed, resulted in the reduction of RCA-I binding toward N-linked oligosaccharides of the membrane glycoproteins. Differences were found in their Km values toward UDP-Gal and GlcNAc\xdf-S-pNP and in their acceptor specificities toward oligosaccharides with the GlcNAc\xdf1->4(GlcNAc\xdf1->2)Man branch and with the GlcNAc\xdf1->6(GlcNAc\xdf1->2)Man branch.

"b'Anatomical studies in monkeys, and functional imaging and lesion studies in humans, suggest that, within the primate medial temporal neocortex, the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) is particularly involved in spatial tasks. However, evidence for a functional specialization of the PHC regarding its spatial memory functions has so far been lacking. Here, we investigated spatial memory functions of the human perirhinal cortex (PRC) and PHC. Patients with lesions affecting the PRC but sparing the PHC, and patients with lesions affecting both PRC and PHC, performed an oculomotor delayed response task with unpredictably varied memory delays of up to 30 s. Compared to controls, patients with PRC+PHC lesions showed a significant delay-dependent inaccuracy of memory-guided eye movements contralateral to the lesion side, whereas patients with PRC lesions showed no significant inaccuracy. Our results show that the PHC is a critical component for spatial memory in humans and suggest that (i) extrahippocampal spatial memory functions of the medial temporal lobe may not be equally distributed in the medial temporal neocortex, but may be largely confined to the PHC, and (ii) damage to connections between cortices involved in spatial cognition and rostral regions of the temporal lobe is unlikely to account for the observed spatial memory deficits with PHC lesions.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Background Besides melanoma susceptibility genes and shared environmental exposures, part of the familial clustering of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) might be due to familial aggregation of melanoma-associated phenotypes. Our goal was to assess the patterns of familial aggregation of three melanoma risk factors: great number of naevi (GNN), light phototype (LP) and high degree of sun exposure (HDSE).\r\n\r\nMethods Familial aggregation of GNN, LP and HDSE was investigated in 66 French families with at least two CMM cases and was measured by the asssociation of the relatives' traits with the probands' traits, using the generalized estimating equations approach. The probands were the melanoma cases leading to ascertainment of the families, subdivided into cases (with the trait studied) and controls (without the trait).\r\n\r\nResults We found significant evidence for familial aggregation of GNN only among sibs (OR = 3.7, 95% CI : 1.4\x9610.5, P = 0.01), of LP among blood relatives (OR = 3.8, 95% CI : 1.8\x968.0, P = 0.004) and of HDSE among blood relatives (OR = 4.5, 95% CI : 2.1\x969.9, P < 0.001) and spouses (OR = 44.3, 95% CI : 5.1\x96382.2, P < 10\x963). These results suggest that genetic factors might account for the clustering of GNN and LP and shared environment for the aggregation of HDSE. The GNN clustering was lower in families with increasing numbers of CMM (>=3 cases) or presence of p16 mutations, the opposite being observed for LP and HDSE. Moreover, the familial aggregation of LP was significantly lower in families with highly sun-exposed members.\r\n\r\nConclusion Melanoma might not only result from specific genetic and environmental factors but also from those underlying melanoma-associated traits involving complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.""",3
"b'This study is based on a subsample of 15- and 16-year-old school students from the UK, part of the European School Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). Information was available on truancy rates, perceived school performance, family structure, lifestyle, and usage of alcohol, cigarettes and illicit drugs in 6409 teenagers. Living in a single-parent family, lack of constructive hobbies, presence of psychiatric symptoms, and an aggressive outgoing delinquent lifestyle bore the strongest associations to truancy and to perceived school performance. There were also strong relationships between both these last two variables and use of alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs. However, the effects of alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs were largely accounted for by other variables.

"b'We examined the processes of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal brain during spontaneous sleep state transitions and during central nervous processing of vibroacoustic stimulations (VASs) using nonlinear analysis of the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that the post-translational formation of aldehyde\x96protein adducts may be an important process in the aetiology of alcohol-induced muscle disease. However, other studies have shown that in a variety of tissues, alcohol induces the formation of various other adduct species, including hybrid acetaldehyde\x96malondialdehyde\x96protein adducts and adducts with free radicals themselves, e.g. hydroxyethyl radical (HER)\x96protein adducts. Furthermore, acetaldehyde\x96protein adducts may be formed in reducing or non-reducing environments resulting in distinct molecular entities, each with unique features of stability and immunogenicity. Some in vitro studies have also suggested that unreduced adducts may be converted to reduced adducts in situ. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that in muscle a variety of different adduct species are formed after acute alcohol exposure and that unreduced adducts predominate. Methods: Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against unreduced and reduced aldehydes and the HER\x96protein adducts. These were used to assay different adduct species in soleus (type I fibre-predominant) and plantaris (type II fibre-predominant) muscles and liver in four groups of rats administered acutely with either [A] saline (control); [B] cyanamide (an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor); [C] ethanol; [D] cyanamide+ethanol. Results: Amounts of unreduced acetaldehyde and malondialdehyde adducts were increased in both muscles of alcohol-dosed rats. However there was no increase in the amounts of reduced acetaldehyde adducts, as detected by both the rabbit polyclonal antibody and the RT1.1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, there was no detectable increase in malondialdehyde\x96acetaldehyde and HER\x96protein adducts. Similar results were obtained in the liver. Conclusions: Adducts formed in skeletal muscle and liver of rats exposed acutely to ethanol are mainly unreduced acetaldehyde and malondialdehyde species.\r\n\r\n'",0

The pure isomers were characterized in several ways; 1H-NMR spectroscopy, for instance, revealed distinct resonances associated with the Lewis x group [Gal[beta]1-4(Fuc[alpha]1-3)GlcNAc] located at the proximal, middle, and distal positions of the polylactosamine chain. Chromatography on immobilized wheat germ agglutinin was crucial in the separation process used; the isomers carrying the fucose at the reducing end GlcNAc possessed particularly low affinities for the lectin.

"b'A human cDNA for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:[alpha]1,3-d-mannoside [beta]1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-IV) was isolated from a liver cDNA library using a probe based on a partial cDNA sequence of the bovine GnT-IV.

Transient expression of the human cDNA in COS7 cells increased total cellular GnT-IV activity 25-fold, demonstrating that this cDNA encodes a functional human GnT-IV. Northern blot analysis of normal tissues indicated that at least five different sizes of mRNA (9.7, 7.6, 5.1, 3.8, and 2.4 kb) forGnT-IV are expressed in vivo. Furthermore, these mRNAs are expressed at different levels between tissues. Large amounts of mRNA were detected in tissues harboring T lineage cells.

"b'The lectin complement pathway is initiated by binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) to carbohydrates. In the human lectin pathway, MASP-1 and MASP-2 are involved in the proteolysis of C4, C2 and C3. Here we report that the human MBL\x96MASP complex contains a new 22 kDa protein [small MBL-associated protein (sMAP)] bound to MASP-1. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of sMAP cDNA revealed that it is a truncated form of MASP-2, consisting of the first two domains (i.e. the first internal repeat and the epidermal growth factor-like domain) with four different C-terminal amino acids. sMAP mRNAs are expressed in liver by alternative polyadenylation of the MASP-2 gene, in which a sMAP-specific exon containing an in-frame stop codon and a polyadenylation signal is used. The involvement of sMAP in the MBL\x96MASP complex suggests that the activation mechanism of the lectin pathway is more complicated than that of the classical pathway.'",4

Here we show that ligation of the A6H antigen with mAb induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Lck protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). Co-ligation of the A6H antigen with CD3 resulted in augmented Lck phosphorylation and mitogenesis. In addition, A6H ligation induced an up-regulation of CD3-mediated phosphorylation of the 23 kDa high mol. wt form of TCR {zeta}ISOdia{zeta} and the {zeta}ISOdia{zeta}-associated protein, ZAP-70. Co-precipitation of Lck and ZAP-70 was only seen in T cells activated by combined A6H and anti-CD3 stimulation. In contrast, another Src family PTK, Fyn, was not affected by A6H ligation. In conclusion, we now demonstrate, for the first time, that A6H ligation triggers Lck phosphorylation, and that cross-talk between A6H and the TCR\x96CD3 complex involves Lck, ZAP-70 and the slow migrating isoform of TCR {zeta}ISOdia{zeta}. These results further suggests that A6H ligation is sufficient for triggering some of the early events in T cell activation, whereas full activation of the T cell, characterized by proliferation and cytokine production, requires co-ligation of the TCR\x96CD3 complex.'",4
"b'Background Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an oxidant gas that contaminates both outdoor and indoor air, is considered to be a potential risk factor for asthma. We investigated concurrently the effects of outdoor and indoor NO2 on the prevalence and incidence of respiratory symptoms among children.\r\n\r\nMethods A cohort study was carried out over 3 years on 842 schoolchildren living in seven different communities in Japan. Indoor NO2 concentrations over 24 hours were measured in both winter and summer in the homes of the subjects, and a 3-year average of the outdoor NO2 concentration was determined for each community. Respiratory symptoms were evaluated every year from responses to questionnaires.\r\n\r\nResults The prevalence of bronchitis, wheeze, and asthma significantly increased with increases of indoor NO2 concentrations among girls, but not among boys. In neither boys nor girls were there significant differences in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among urban, suburban, and rural districts. The incidence of asthma increased among children living in areas with high concentrations of outdoor NO2. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a 10 parts per billion (ppb) increase of outdoor NO2 concentration was associated with an increased incidence of wheeze and asthma (odds ratios [OR] = 1.76, 95% CI : 1.04\x963.23 and OR = 2.10, 95% CI : 1.10\x964.75, respectively), but that no such associations were found with indoor NO2 concentration (OR = 0.73, 95% CI : 0.45\x961.14 and OR = 0.87, 95% CI : 0.51\x961.43, respectively).\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings suggest that outdoor NO2 air pollution may be particularly important for the development of wheeze and asthma among children. Indoor NO2 concentrations were associated with the prevalence of respiratory symptoms only among girls. Girls may be more susceptible to indoor air pollution than boys.'",3
"b'Skp1 is a subunit of SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligases and other protein complexes in the nucleus and cytoplasm of yeast and mammalian cells. In Dictyostelium, Skp1 is partially modified by an unusual pentasaccharide O-linked to hydroxyproline143. This modification was found to be susceptible to known prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors based on Mr-shift analysis using SDS\x96polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western blotting. In addition, Dictyostelium Skp1 consists of 2 genetic isoforms, Skp1A and Skp1B, which differ by a single amino acid and appear to be expressed throughout the life cycle based on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions. The significance of these structural variations was examined by expressing myc-tagged Skp1s and mutants that lacked the glycosylation site. Gel-based Mr-shift studies showed that Skp1A and Skp1B are both nearly completely glycosylated during growth and early development, and mass spectrometry of glycopeptides showed that they were glycosylated similarly. Skp1 expressed later in prespore cells was not glycosylated, unlike bulk Skp1 persisting from earlier in development, but became glycosylated after return to growth medium. Skp1A and Skp1B were each concentrated in the nucleus and regions of the cytoplasm, based on immunofluorescence localization. However, when Skp1 glycosylation was blocked by mutation, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, or expression in prespore cells, nuclear concentration of Skp1 was not detected. Furthermore, nuclear concentration occurred in a mutant that attached only the core disaccharide to Skp1. Overall, there was no evidence for differential Skp1 isoform expression, glycosylation variants in the bulk Skp1 pool, or regulation of nuclear localization. However, these studies uncovered evidence that the glycosylation pathway is developmentally regulated and can function posttranslationally, and that core glycosylation is required for Skp1\x92s nuclear concentration.'",2
"b'\xdf2-Microglobulin (\xdf2m)-associated human CD1b proteins present lipid and glycolipid antigens, which are loaded on CD1b in endosomal compartments. In contrast, the related MHC class I molecules acquire antigenic peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we investigated the biogenesis of CD1b before \xdf2m binding in comparison to MHC class I. In \xdf2m-deficient FO-1 cells, we found CD1b heavy chains (HC) complexed with the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, while MHC class I HC associated only with calnexin. Despite this difference, both CD1b HC and MHC class I HC were degraded when the chaperone interactions were prevented by the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine. The degradation of both molecules included the proteasome and mannosidases. Chaperone-unassociated CD1b could be rescued from degradation by supplementing FO-1 cells with \xdf2m. Finally, prevention of chaperone interaction significantly reduced neoexpression of CD1b upon differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells, underlining the importance of chaperones for proper expression of CD1b under physiological conditions.'",4
"b'Herein we review the evidence that neocortical projection neurons and interneurons are derived from distinct regions within the telencephalon. While neocortical projection neurons are derived from the ventricular zone of the neocortex, neocortical interneurons appear to be derived from the germinal zone of the basal ganglia. These interneurons follow a tangential migratory pathway from the ganglionic eminences to the cortex. Interneurons of the olfactory bulb follow a distinct tangential migration from the basal ganglia. The Dlx homeobox genes, which are essential for basal ganglia differentiation, are also required for the development of neocortical and olfactory bulb interneurons. Furthermore, evidence is presented that retroviral-mediated expression of DLX2 in neocortical cells can induce GABAergic interneuron differentiation.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Although heavy alcohol intake is known to be one of the most common causative factors of liver disease, pancreatitis, upper gastrointestinal and neurological disorders, the influence of the drinking pattern is largely unknown. The study investigated the relationship of alcohol-related medical disorders in alcoholics and their drinking pattern. Two hundred and forty-one chronic alcoholics were referred consecutively for detoxification and their drinking pattern was sufficient for them to be included in this study. History of alcohol abuse as well as drinking behaviour in the last 6 months were assessed by a semi-structured interview. Findings included intensive clinical examination with abdominal ultrasound in most subjects. Heavy drinking with frequent inebriation was most often found in our sample (44.4%), whereas continuous heavy alcohol consumption without intoxication (33.6%), and an episodic drinking style (22.0%) were less frequent. The heavy drinkers suffered more often from pancreatitis, oesophageal varices, polyneuropathy or erectile dysfunction than episodic drinkers. They also showed more upper gastrointestinal disorders, although the estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to continuous drinkers. No difference relating to withdrawal delirium or seizures could be found between the groups of alcoholics. Frequent heavy drinkers showed a trend to more alcohol-related medical disorders than alcoholics with a different drinking pattern, although they were younger and their estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to that of continuous drinkers. Thus, the drinking pattern, particularly frequent inebriation, has an influence on the occurrence of alcohol-related disorders.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'In rat visual cortex neurons that are immunoreactive for the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR+) constitute a distinct family which accounts for 17% of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing cells. It is not clear, however, (i) whether CR is expressed exclusively in GABAergic neurons and (ii) how CR+ neurons are incorporated into neuronal circuits of rat visual cortex. To address these questions we studied synaptic relationships of CR+ neurons with GABA+ and GABA\x96 elements in the neuropil of rat primary visual cortex (area 17). All CR+ neurons are nonpyramidal cells with smooth or sparsely spiny and often beaded dendrites. Of all CR+ neurons, 56% are located in layers 1 and 2/3. In layer 2/3, most CR+ neurons are bipolar-shaped and have vertically oriented dendrites. Many ascending dendritic branches reach layer 1 where they run parallel to pial surface. CR+ axons are thin, highly branched near the cell body and often send descending collaterals to layers 5 and 6. Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed GABA in 94% of CR+ cell bodies in layer 2/3. Electron microscopic analysis shows that all CR+ axon terminals contain elongated vesicles and form symmetric synapses. Postembedding staining shows that 98% of CR+ terminals are GABA+. GABA-immunoreactivity is also present in somata and thick dendrites of CR+ neurons but many thin dendrites are GABA\x96. CR+ somata, dendrites and axon terminals are enriched in mitochondria. Somata and thick CR+ dendrites are densely innervated. At least 68% of the targets of CR+ terminals in layer 2/3 are GABA+ and >=50% of these are other CR+ neurons. The remainder (32%) of targets of CR+ terminals are thin dendrites of GABA\x96 cells. In contrast, in layers 5 and 6, 60% of CR+ terminals form synapses with GABA\x96 somatic profiles. The preferential interactions of layer 2/3 CR+ neurons with GABAergic neurons, and with CR+ neurons in particular, suggests that these cells play a role in the inhibition of inhibitory neurons of the same layer. Through these interactions CR+ cells may reduce inhibition of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3, 5 and 6 and thus disinhibit a column of neurons.'",1
"b'We describe a new population of non-naive B cells in the peripheral blood of quasimonoclonal (QM) mice. Surface Ig of switched isotypes is expressed, but not B220 nor CD19. These cells are larger and denser than naive B cells but smaller than blasts or plasma cells; they do not stain with syndecan, a marker for plasma cells. Telomerase, which is usually expressed in B cell blasts, was not present in this population. We sorted the switched, idiotype-positive, B220\x96 B cells from the peripheral blood of QM mice and sequenced Ig H chain and {lambda} L chain cDNA. There were many point mutations but no V gene replacements, gene conversions or other type of diversifications. As they express switched isotypes and have mutated their Ig genes, cells in the B220\x96, CD19\x96 population must have been in an immune response and we suggest that it includes the memory B cell subset.'",4
"b'A group of 30 chronic alcoholics without alcohol-related diseases and 30 controls (teetotallers) were selected to measure serum levels of endothelial adhesion molecules (AMs) (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin). ICAM-1 and E-selectin serum levels were higher in alcoholics, whereas VCAM-1 serum levels were similar in both groups. There was a significant correlation between daily alcohol intake and serum level of ICAM-1 (r = 0.49, P = 0.003) and E-selectin (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). A significant positive correlation between E-selectin and total lifetime dose of ethanol was also observed (r = 0.52, P = 0.003). These changes in serum levels of endothelial AMs of chronic alcoholics may reflect endothelial and/or immune activation, and could interfere with the reactions between immune cells and the endothelium.'",0
"b""The transcription of the MHC class I genes is regulated by interaction of cis-elements, located in the 5' genomic flanking regions, with sequence-specific trans-factors. We have identified a cis-regulatory element, 5'-TGACGCG-3', of the H-2Dd gene. This cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate regulatory element (CRE)-like sequence, named H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1) binding motif, is highly conserved among species. In addition, we found that homo- and heterodimers of activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) and CRE binding protein (CREB) associate with the H-2 BF1 binding motif and activate transcription of the H-2Dd gene. Here we demonstrate that a homologue of ATF-1, originally isolated and designated ATF-1DN, acts as a dominant repressor, blocking the ability of wild-type ATF-1 and CREB to bind to the H-2 BF1 probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). We have utilized this molecule to analyze the participation of the H-2 BF1 complexes, consisting of the H-2 BF1 binding motif and ATF-1/CREB trans-factors, in the physiological regulation of MHC class I expression in tissue culture cells. A human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, was transfected with ATF-1DN and clones expressing the gene transcripts were selected. When analyzed in the EMSA, nuclear proteins prepared from these clones exhibited a decreased shift of the H-2 BF1 probe corresponding to the levels of the ATF-1DN gene expression. Additionally, MHC class I expression of cells with reduced H-2 BF1 activity was significantly higher than in control cells lacking ATF-1DN. These findings indicate that in these carcinoma cells, the H-2 BF1 complexes negatively regulate the constitutive expression of MHC class I.""",4
"b'Background Suicide may be an extreme expression of liability to death of any type. If true, suicide risk factors should also increase other mortality, and, given exposure, excess risk should be higher for suicide than for other mortality.\r\n\r\nMethods Of 304 publications identified in Index Medicus (1966\x96June 1988) by the string (suicide) and (mortality or death) and (accidental or natural), 24 reported total and cause-specific mortality associated with exposure to 16 established suicide risk factors; reference scanning yielded 122 more. These 146 publications reported on 163 cohorts (total subjects = 1179 126) mortality. Meta-analysis gave random effects standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for natural, accidental and suicidal death, stratified over the 16 risk groups.\r\n\r\nResults Overall, SMR were 8.6 (95% CI : 7.1\x9610.4) for suicide, 3.4 (95% CI : 2.9\x964.0) for accidental and 2.1 (95% CI : 1.9\x962.3) for natural death. Compatible with the first hypothesis, in most groups, mortality of any type was raised. Supporting the second hypothesis, excesses increased from lowest for natural death to highest for suicide. This trend was most pronounced following deliberate self-harm, intermediate in substance abusers, and weakest, but present, in bereaved and low social class cohorts and reversed in smokers and epileptic people.\r\n\r\nConclusions Many suicide risks apply to any type of premature death, whilst also retaining some specificity for suicide. Primary prevention, targeting such generic risk factors, will not only reduce rates of suicide but also of other types of death. Conversely, when prevention focuses on specific outcomes\x97such as suicide\x97only, other types of mortality may increase.'",3
"b'Human MHC class II antigens include HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP molecules that present antigens to CD4+ T cells, as well as the non-classical molecules HLA-DM and -DO. HLA-DM promotes peptide binding to class II molecules in endocytic compartments and HLA-DO, which is physically associated with HLA-DM in B lymphocytes, regulates HLA-DM function. Antibodies specific for the DO\xdf chain were obtained by immunization of mice with a heterodimer consisting of a chimeric DO\xdf chain (DR/DO\xdf), containing 18 N-terminal residues of DR\xdf, paired with the DR{alpha} chain and isolated from transfected murine fibroblasts. The specificity of this serum for the DO\xdf chain and the lysosomal expression of the HLA-DO protein was confirmed using mutant human B cell lines lacking DR or DO molecules. The lysosomal localization of HLA-DO in human B cells contrasts with the cell surface expression of the mixed pair in transfected murine fibroblasts and raises questions concerning the role of the putative targeting motifs in HLA-DO. Transfection of the chimeric DR/DO\xdf chain along with DR{alpha} into human epithelial HeLa cells resulted in high levels of expression of the mixed isotypic pair at the surface of transfectants as well as in lysosomes. The same pattern was observed in HeLa cells transfected with the DO\xdf chimera and a DR{alpha} chain lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Taken together, these results suggest that functional sorting motifs exist in the DO\xdf chain but that the tight compartmentalization of HLA-DO observed inside B lymphocytes is controlled by the HLA-DO{alpha} chain and HLA-DM.'",4
"b'Transcranial freeze lesions in neonatal rat pups produce microgyri and adjacent epileptogenic regions of neocortex that can be used to model human polymicrogyria. The hypothesis that the presence of microgyri is associated with abnormal cortical organization occurring within as well as adjacent to the microgyri was tested by creating microgyri within the face representation of somatosensory cortex. Microgyri were associated with a widespread disruption of the stereotypic whisker barrel field pattern delineated with cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining. CO-stained patches resembling barrel hollows were absent within the microgyrus, and were abnormally shaped and distributed outside of the microgyrus. Adjacent Nisslor acetylcholinesterase-stained sections demonstrated that both cell clusters and thalamocortical afferents contributed to the abnormally organized paramicrogyral zone identified in CO-stained sections. Field potential recordings showed that this region of heavy CO staining corresponded to the epileptogenic zone adjacent to the microgyrus. Results support our hypothesis that the epileptogenic paramicrogyral zone develops an abnormal organization of cell clusters and thalamocortical projections that could contribute to epileptogenesis in the paramicrogyral zone.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The screening of new agents for aversive therapy of alcoholism requires a simple animal model. Animals trained to ingest ethanol solutions and subsequently administered a drug known to produce an aversion to ethanol in humans, do not readily make the association between the malaise induced by the aversive drug\x96ethanol reaction and the consumption of the same ethanol-containing solution that has been consumed previously without ill effects. An experimental paradigm is reported in which the malaise of the drug\x96ethanol reaction is quickly recognized by rats as derived from ethanol. Disulfiram was used as the model drug. Lewis rats were deprived of water for 18 h after which 6% (v/v) ethanol was offered as the only fluid. During the first hour of ethanol access, both controls (vehicle) and disulfiram (100 mg/kg)-treated animals consumed intoxicating amounts of ethanol (0.7\x960.9 g ethanol/kg). Plasma acetaldehyde levels developed were 3\x965 \xb5M and 40\x9650 \xb5M in the two groups respectively. After this time, disulfiram-treated animals virtually ceased consuming alcohol (90% inhibition), indicating that the disulfiram\x96ethanol reaction is associated with alcohol ingestion. Control animals continued consuming the alcohol solution for the additional 4\x965 h tested. This model should be of value in the testing of new agents that reduce aldehyde dehydrogenase levels for prolonged periods for their potential as an aversive treatment in alcoholism.'",0
"b'UDP-GlcNAc:{alpha}3-D-mannoside \xdf-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI; EC 2.4.1.101) is a medial-Golgi enzyme that is essential for the processing of oligomannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans. On the basis of highly conserved sequences obtained from previously cloned mammalian GnTI genes, cDNAs for two closely related GnTI isoenzymes were isolated from a Xenopus laevis ovary cDNA library. As typical for glycosyltransferases, both proteins exhibit a type II transmembrane protein topology with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (4 amino acids); a transmembrane domain of 22 residues; a stem region with a length of 81 (isoenzyme A) and 77 (isoenzyme B) amino acids, respectively; and a catalytic domain consisting of 341 residues. The two proteins differ not only in length but also at 13 (stem) and 18 (catalytic domain) positions, respectively. The overall identity of the catalytic domains of the X. laevis GnTI isoenzymes with their mammalian and plant orthologues ranges from 30% (Nicotiana tabacum) to 67% (humans). Isoenzymes A and B are encoded by two separate genes that were both found to be expressed in all tissues examined, albeit in varying amounts and ratios. On expression of the cDNAs in the baculovirus/insect cell system, both isoenzymes were found to exhibit enzymatic activity. Isoenzyme B is less efficiently folded in vivo and thus appears of lower physiological relevance than isoenzyme A. However, substitution of threonine at position 223 with alanine was sufficient to confer isoenzyme B with properties similar to those observed for isoenzyme A.'",2

Methods: A random sample of 166 clients of a health management organization, participated in this study. They were visited in their households and completed a self-report questionnaire, which included the AUDIT. Later, they answered the alcohol-related disorders (ARDs) Section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to find the best cut-off point for ICD-10 diagnosis of ARDs. Confirmatory factor analysis was run to assess the construct validity. Results: The ROC analysis showed the same cut-off point (7/8) for ICD-10 diagnosis of ARDs found in previous studies carried out in primary care settings, including in Brazil, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76%. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested a two-factor structure. The first factor measured consumption and the second factor alcohol-related problems. Conclusions: The results supported the use of the self-reported version of the AUDIT in epidemiologic studies, and showed a similar cut-off point for detection of ARDs and hazardous drinking.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1 can induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} expression in T cells and monocytes, through different signaling pathways. We have stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with TSST-1 and found that the major cell producers of TNF-{alpha} as detected by cytofluorimetry and immunocytochemistry were CD4+ T lymphocytes. The expression of TNF-{alpha} by CD4+ T cells can be inhibited by either, wortmannin (WN) or LY 294002, two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitors. The inhibitory effect is not transcriptional as WN does not change the mRNA steady state of TNF-{alpha} at any of the concentrations tested and LY 294002 when preincubated with mononuclear cells at its median inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 1.4 \xb5M) significantly inhibited the expression of TNF-{alpha} but not its mRNA. Immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled intracellular TNF-{alpha} showed a specific decrease in the synthesis of this cytokine on cells treated with PI 3-K inhibitors. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in control of TNF-{alpha} translation in human macrophages. In T cells, we have found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 significantly decreased the secretion of TNF-{alpha} but not its mRNA. In addition, the combined use of WN and SB 203580 had an additive inhibitory effect on secretion of TNF-{alpha}. Therefore, both PI 3-K and p38 MAPK signaling pathways control TNF-{alpha} production in T cells.'",4

In all, 594 individuals representative of the El Hierro population for gender, age, district and the altitude at which they lived were included. The factors measured included HDL, living altitude, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, alcohol consumption, diabetes, menopause in women, and physical activity and dietary habits.\r\n\r\nResults The HDL showed a correlation with living altitude (r = 0.14, P < 0.01) and with BMI (r = \x960.19, P < 0.01). Smokers had lower HDL levels than ex-smokers and non-smokers (P < 0.05). Men who were moderate drinkers had higher HDL levels than heavy or mild drinkers and non-drinkers (P < 0.01). Physical activity was only related to HDL in men with levels >1.52 mmol/l, who walked on the average more than the rest (P < 0.05). Variables not showing the expected relationship with HDL were diabetes and the menopause in women (probably due to a low statistical power of their subsamples). Regression analysis, with HDL as dependent variable showed that the association between HDL and altitude persists when taking altitude as a categorical or a continuous variable.\r\n\r\nConclusions High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are linearly and significantly increased when living at a higher altitude. This fact should be taken into account when comparing cardiovascular risk in populations living at different altitudes.'",3
"b'The cytotoxicity reaction of murine CD8 T lymphocytes has been found to be strongly inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of hypericin, a lipophilic dianthraquinone with photodynamic properties. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-induced target cell apoptosis, as well as exocytosis of cytolytic granules from these cells, were ablated by hypericin, administered at the onset of the reaction, without affecting CTL viability. The inhibition of cytolysis occurred without the light irradiation which is essential for photosensitization. The findings suggest that the action of hypericin targets the effector CTL; however, apoptosis induced in murine L-cells with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} was also prevented by hypericin. Since hypericin is a known inhibitor of protein kinase C, MAP kinase and at least one other tyrosine kinase, this inhibitory activity could play a role in the down-modulation of CTL-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, our studies show that the action of hypericin induces rapid dephosphorylation of phospholipids associated with low-density membranes in CTL, but not with membranes of the cytotoxic granules. The ability of hypericin to interfere with cytotoxicity may render it useful in the treatment of T cell-mediated diseases.'",4
"b'The analysis of protein-linked glycans is of increasing importance, both in basic glycobiological research and during the production process of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the amount of glycoprotein available for typing the glycans is very low. This, combined with the high branching complexity typical for this class of compounds, makes glycan typing a challenging task. We present here methodology allowing the medium-throughput analysis of N-glycans derived from low picomole amounts of glycoproteins using the standard DNA-sequencing equipment available in any life sciences laboratory. The high sensitivity of the overall analytical process (from glycoprotein to results) is obtained using state-of-the-art deglycosylation procedures combined with a highly efficient and reproducible novel postderivatization cleanup step involving Sephadex G10 packed 96-well filterplates. All sample preparation steps (enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGase F, desalting, derivatization with 8-amino-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid, and postderivatization cleanup) are performed using 96-well-based plates. This integrated sample preparation scheme is also compatible with capillary electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS platforms already in use in some glycobiology labs and anticipates the higher throughput that will be offered by the capillary-array-based DNA sequencers currently penetrating the market.

"b'Fragile-X syndrome is the most common single-gene inherited form of mental retardation. Morphological studies suggest a possible failure of the synapse maturation process. Cerebral cortical spine morphology in fragile-X syndrome and in a knockout mouse model of it appears immature, with long, thin spines much more common than the stubby and mushroom-shaped spines more characteristic of normal development. In human fragile-X syndrome there is also a higher density of spines along dendrites, suggesting a possible failure of synapse elimination. While variously misshapen spines are characteristic of a number of mental retardation syndromes, the overabundance of spines seen in fragile-X syndrome is unusual. Taken with evidence of neurotransmitter activation of the synthesis of the fragile-X protein (FMRP) at synapses in vitro and evidence for behaviorally induced FMRP expression in vivo, and with evidence compatible with a role for FMRP in regulating the synthesis of other proteins, it is possible that FMRP serves as an \x91immediate early protein\x92 at the synapse that orchestrates aspects of synaptic development and plasticity.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'Self-reported drinking habits were examined in a random sample of 1067 persons aged 25\x9664 years in the Seychelles, a country in epidemiological transition where consumption of home-brewed, mostly unregistered beverages has been traditionally high. Alcohol consumption was calculated from respondents reporting at least one drink per week (\x91regular drinkers\x92). Among men, 51.1% were regular drinkers and had average intake of 112.1 ml alcohol a day. Among women, 5.9% were regular drinkers and had 49.7 ml alcohol a day. Frequency of drinking, but not amount per drinker, was slightly less in the 25\x9634-year than older-age categories. Home-brews (mostly palm toddy and fermented sugar cane juice) were consumed by 52% of regular drinkers and accounted for 54% of the total alcohol intake reported by all regular drinkers. Based on the reported consumption by regular drinkers only, the average annual alcohol consumption amounted respectively to 20.7 litres and 1.2 litres per man and woman aged 25\x9664 years, or, using extrapolation, 13.2 litres and 0.8 litres per man and woman respectively of the total population. These values may underestimate the true figures by half, since reported beer consumption accounted for 53% of beer sales. Socio-economic status was associated strongly and inversely with home-brew consumption, but slightly and positively with consumption of commercially marketed beverages. Alcohol intake was associated with smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and blood pressure, but not with age and body mass index. In conclusion, these data show high alcohol consumption in the Seychelles with an important gender difference, a large proportion of alcohol derived from home-brews, and opposite tendencies for the relationships between socio-economic status and home-made or commercially marketed beverages.'",0
"b'Moderate regular alcohol intake has been found to be associated with a decreased risk for coronary heart disease and stroke. We investigated the effects of acute intake of red wine (60 g ethanol) and a standard dinner under controlled conditions on haemostatic factors. Shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA) decreased after the intake of alcohol irrespective of whether the subjects were fasting or not, and also after the intake of food. The intake of alcohol inhibited the postprandial increase of von Willebrand factor multimers. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity (PAI-1) and serum triglycerides were increased by alcohol. Excretion of the platelet thromboxane A2 metabolites 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 and 2,3-dinorthromboxane B2, as well as the endothelial prostacyclin metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-ketoprostaglandin F1{alpha}, into urine was not influenced by either alcohol or food. We conclude that eating a dinner together with red wine has no untoward effect on SIPA and that the decrease of SIPA is not specific for alcohol.\r\n\r\n'",0

The treatment with CTB induced morphological alternations of PC12 cells, such as augmentation of the cell body, neurite extension, and branched spikes of tips of neurites. The neurite extension induced with CTB was strongly suppressed by the pretreatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis showed that CTB induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins with molecular masses around 120, 70, and 45\x9640 kDa in PC12 cells. Some of the proteins identified were extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERKs) (ERK1 and ERK2). The peak activation of ERKs lasted for 60\x9690 min and gradually decreased thereafter.\r\n\r\nImmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the intracellular events induced with CTB are not related with the activation of Trk proteins, suggesting that signals evoked by ligation of endogenous GM1a are unique and distinct from those induced with exogenous GM1a.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presence of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, at a concentration of 10 \xb5M diminished the neurite extension of PC12 cells induced with CTB, ERK activation was still observed. However, pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, abolished the activation of ERKs induced with CTB in a dose-dependent manner and only attenuated the morphological alternations of PC12 cells.\r\n\r\nConsidered together, we concluded that tyrosine phosphorylation induced with CTB was responsible for neuron-like differentiation of PC12 cells and that the MEK\x96ERK cascade is part of the biological signals mediated by endogenous ganglioside GM1a on PC12 cells.'",2
"b'Background In epidemiological studies researchers often depend on proxies to obtain information when primary subjects are unavailable. However, relatively few studies have performed formal statistical inference to assess agreement among proxy informants and primary study subjects. In this paper, we consider inference procedures for studies of interobserver agreement characterized by two raters and three or more outcome categories. Of particular interest is the consequence of dichotomizing such data on the expected confidence interval width for the kappa coefficient. The effect of dichotomization on sample size requirements for testing hypotheses concerning kappa is also evaluated.\r\n\r\nMethods Simulation studies were used to compare coverage levels and widths for constructing confidence intervals. Sample size requirements were compared for multinomial and dichotomous data. We illustrate our results using a published data set on drinking habits that assesses agreement among primary and proxy respondents.\r\n\r\nResults Our results show that when multinomial data are treated as dichotomous, not only do the expected confidence interval widths become greater, but the penalty in terms of larger sample size requirements for hypothesis testing can be severe.\r\n\r\nConclusion We conclude that there are clear advantages in preserving multinomial data on the original scale rather than collapsing the data into a binary trait.'",3
"b'Complete 1H and 13C NMR assignments are reported for two glycopeptides representing the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of connective tissue proteoglycans. These glycopeptides are the octasaccharide hexapeptide, Ser(GlcpA[beta](1->3) Galp[beta](1->3)Galp[beta](1->4)Xylp[beta])-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser (GlcpA[beta](1->3)Galp[beta](1->3)Galp[beta](1->4)Xylp[beta])-Gly (1), and the tetrasaccharide dipeptide, Ser(GlcpA[beta](1->3)Galp[beta](1->3)Galp[beta](1->4)Xylp[beta])-Gly (2). The vicinal coupling constant data show that the monosaccharide residues adopt 4C1 chair conformations. Distance geometry/simulated annealing calculations using 2D NOESY derived distance constraints yielded a single family of structures for the tetrasaccharide moiety, with well defined interglycosidic linkage conformations. The [phis] torsion angles of the glycosidic C1[prime]-O1 bonds showed a strict preference for the -sc range whereas the [psi] torsion angles (O1-Cn) exhibited dependence upon the interglycosidic linkage position (-ac for [beta](1->3) linkage, +ac for [beta](1->4) linkage). The predominant conformation about the glycopeptide bond is [phis] = -sc and [psi] = +ac. The presence of strong daN (i, i+1) NOE contacts, and the general absence of dNN (i, i+1) contacts (except for a weak Ser-5/Gly-6 dNN contact) and the dbN (i, i+1) contacts (except for Ser-1/Gly-2) in the ROESY spectrum, suggest that the backbone for 1 is predominantly in an extended conformation. A comparison of the ROESY data for 1 with those obtained from the unglycosylated hexapeptide (3) of the same sequence suggests that glycosylation has only a marginal influence on the backbone conformation of the hexapeptide.'",2
"b""ZEB, an E-box binding transcriptional repressor, is an important regulator of T cell and muscle development. Targeted disruption of ZEB in mice resulted in a strong reduction of thymocytes and the few T cells that reached the mature stage were predominantly CD4+. CD4 expression during the various stages of T cell differentiation is controlled at the transcriptional level by a complex array of regulatory elements in the CD4 gene locus, consisting of at least three enhancers, one promoter and one silencer. Here we present evidence that CD4 gene expression is negatively regulated by ZEB. We show that ZEB binds to the 5'E-box in the CD4-3 element of the proximal CD4 enhancer in competition with the transcriptional activators E12 and HEB, thereby reducing CD4 expression on CD4 single-positive but not CD4/CD8 double-positive T cells. The conversion of the CD4 proximal enhancer into a potential silencer element by the transcriptional repressor ZEB offers an additional concept of CD4 gene regulation in T cells.""",4
"b'We examined neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in relation to reward expectancy and compared findings with those of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in the monkey. Activity of OFC neurons was examined in a delayed reaction time task where every four trials constituted one block within which three kinds of rewards and no reward were delivered in a fixed order. More than half of OFC delay neurons were related to the expectancy of delivery or nodelivery of a reward as the response outcome, while some neurons showed nature-of-reward-specific anticipatory activity changes. These delay-related activities reflected the preference of the animal for each kind of reward and were modulated by the motivational state of the animal. LPFC neurons are reported to show nature-ofreward-specific anticipatory activity changes in a delayed response task when several different kinds of rewards are used. Such rewarddependent activity is observed in LPFC delay neurons both with and without spatially differential delay (working memory-related) activity. Although reward expectancy-related activity is commonly observed in both OFC and LPFC, it is suggested that the OFC is more concerned with motivational aspects, while the LPFC is related to both the cognitive and motivational aspects of the expectancy of response outcome.'",1
"b'The structure and fold of the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the xenotransplantation antigen, namely pig [alpha]3 galactosyltransferase, has been studied by means of computational methods. Secondary structure predictions indicated that [alpha]3-galactosyltransferase and related protein family members, including blood group A and B transferases and Forssman synthase, are likely to consist of alternating [alpha]-helices and [beta]-strands. Fold recognition studies predicted that [alpha]3-galactosyltransferase shares the same fold as the T4 phage DNA-modifying enzyme [beta]-glucosyltransferase. This latter enzyme displays a strong structural resemblance with the core of glycogen phosphorylase b. By using the three-dimensional structure of [beta]-glucosyltransferase and of several glycogen phosphorylases, the nucleotide binding domain of pig [alpha]3-galactosyltransferase was built by knowledge-based methods. Both the UDP-galactose ligand and a divalent cation were included in the model during the refinement procedure. The final three-dimensional model is in agreement with our present knowledge of the biochemistry and mechanism of [alpha]3-galactosyltransferases.'",2
"b'It is unclear how HgCl2 causes autoimmune disorders in genetically predisposed rodents. We investigated the cytokine profile induced by HgCl2 in vitro, and found a high frequency of IL-2-secreting cells in splenocytes from susceptible A.SW and BALB/c mice, whereas the frequency was low in cells from resistant DBA/2 mice. More IL-2-secreting cells were induced in splenocytes from the high responder A.SW mice than in cells from the intermediate responder BALB/c mice. Unexpectedly, a similar level of IL-4 production was induced in splenocytes from BALB/c and DBA/2 mice. IL-4 production was high in unstimulated cells from A.SW mice and was further increased by HgCl2. IFN-{gamma}-secreting cells were detectable in splenocytes from all three strains after activation by HgCl2. The highest frequency of IL-10-secreting cells was found in splenocytes from A.SW mice after activation, whereas the frequency was lower in cells from BALB/c mice, followed by cells from DBA/2 mice. We showed that neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibody profoundly inhibited the in vitro response to HgCl2. In contrast, antibodies against IL-4, IFN-{gamma} and IL-10 did not significantly affect the response of splenocytes from either A.SW or DBA/2 mice. The addition of IL-2 into cultures enhanced the proliferative response to HgCl2 in splenocytes from DBA/2 mice to a level comparable with that in cells from BALB/c mice. We found no evidence for the suggestion that HgCl2 induces a Th1/Th2 imbalance in resistant/susceptible strains. We conclude that IL-2 may be a limiting factor precluding lymphocytes from resistant mice from responding to HgCl2.'",4
b'To test the predictive validity of a vignette methodology based on a Signal Detection model by examining treatment attrition within an alcohol clinic. Methods: Participants were asked to categorize vignettes that described individuals drinking alcohol as problem or nonproblem alcohol use at the beginning of a 4-week intensive course of treatment. These participants were divided retrospectively into two groups: those who completed treatment and those who dropped-out of treatment. A matched post-treatment long-term abstainer group was also tested. Results: Signal Detection analyses demonstrated that response bias scores predicted who would drop out of treatment (P = 0.01). Conclusions: The vignette methodology provided useful levels of prediction in an applied clinical setting. It was argued that verbal reports from problem alcohol users may be more usefully conceptualized in terms of sensitivity and response bias than in terms of memory or \x91truth\x92.',0
"b'Leukocyte Ig-like receptor (LIR)-1 is a member of the Ig superfamily which has been shown to bind the human cytomegalovirus MHC class I homologue UL-18 protein. In this study, we have analyzed the expression and function of LIR-1 in human NK cells. We show that LIR-1 is expressed by a subset of NK cells variable in size among different donors. When compared to the known HLA class I-specific NK receptors, the expression of LIR-1 was found to be partially overlapped with that of CD94\x96NKG2A or with that of killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) belonging to the Ig superfamily. The use of the soluble form of UL-18 molecule revealed, in double fluorescence analysis, a selective binding to LIR-1+ cells while no correlation was observed between expression of either KIR or CD94\x96NKG2A molecules and ability to bind UL18. We further determined whether LIR-1 could also function as receptor for HLA class I molecules. To this end, we assessed the capability of LIR-1+ NK cell clones of lysing HLA class I\x96 target cells transfected with different class I alleles, including HLA-A, -B, -C and -G alleles. Data revealed that LIR-1 functions as a broad HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptor recognizing different alleles coded for by different HLA loci.'",4
"b'After two consecutive inoculations with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) at 24 h intervals in vivo, CD4 T cells became anergic to the antigen challenge in vitro. Administration of anti-CTLA-4 mAb in conjunction with the second SEB inoculation 24 h after antigen priming interfered with anergy and CD4 T cells became Th2 cells. However, the anergy induction was not ablated when SEB and anti-CTLA-4 mAb were administered 48 or 72 h after antigen priming. Moreover, anti-CTLA-4 mAb without SEB did not interfere with anergy nor promoted the Th2 differentiation. T\x96antigen-presenting cell (APC) interaction in vitro in the presence of high doses of antigen and anti-CTLA-4 mAb induced a Th2-polarizing cytokine IL-6 and IL-10. IL-10 then down-modulated a Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12. The results demonstrate that 24 h after the initial antigen stimulation, CD4 T cells enter the critical activation phase where antigen re-stimulation with or without CTLA-4 engagement alters the fate of the cell, anergy or differentiation respectively. Once anergy is interfered with, Th2-polarizing cytokines produced upon prolonged T\x96APC interaction favor the Th2 differentiation.'",4
"b'CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily which is characterized by four transmembrane (TM) domains and associates with other surface molecules. This tetraspanin was recently found to be expressed on mature T cells. Here, we investigated which molecules associate with CD9 on T cells and which CD9 domains are required for the association. Immunoprecipitation of T cell lysates with anti-CD9 mAb followed by immunoblotting with mAb against various T cell molecules showed the association of CD9 with CD3, CD4, CD5, CD2, CD29 and CD44. Because association with CD5 was most prominent, we determined the role of CD9 TM or extracellular (EC) domains in the association with CD5. CD9 mutant genes lacking each domain were constructed and introduced into EL4 thymoma cells deficient in CD9 but expressing CD5. Among various types of stable EL4 transfectants, EL4 transfected with the mutant gene lacking TM domains (TM2/TM3) between two EC domains expressed a small amount of the relevant protein without showing association with CD5. CD9\x96CD5\x96 monkey COS-7 cells transfected with this mutant gene and the CD5 gene expressed both transfected gene products, but the association of these was not detected. EL4 cells transfected with a CD9/CD81 chimera gene (the CD9 gene containing TM2/TM3 of CD81) expressed the chimeric protein on the cell surface and showed association with CD5. These results suggest an essential role of particular CD9 TM domains in the surface expression of the CD9 molecule as well as the association with CD5.'",4
"b'Background The relationship between air pollution and health is usually analysed by time series analysis.

"b'We used {gamma}{delta} TCR-deficient (TCR{delta}\x96/\x96) mice to examine the role of {gamma}{delta} T cells for induction of mucosal responses and systemic tolerance to high versus low doses of oral antigen. When either TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 or TCR{delta}+/+ mice were immunized orally with a high dose of ovalbumin (OVA) prior to parenteral challenge, systemic IgG and IgE antibody responses were markedly reduced in both types of mice, while mucosal IgA responses were reduced only in the TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 mice. Reduced T cell proliferative responses and delayed-type hypersensitivity were seen in TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 and TCR{delta}+/+ mice given the high dose of OVA. Antigen-induced Th1 and Th2 cytokine production by splenic CD4+ T cells was severely inhibited in orally tolerized TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 and TCR{delta}+/+ mice. In contrast, while oral tolerance associated with increased levels of IL-10 synthesis was induced by a low dose of OVA in TCR{delta}+/+ mice, the TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 mice were not tolerized and failed to produce IL-10. Our findings indicate that {gamma}{delta} T cells play a significant immunoregulatory role in IL-10-mediated, low-dose oral tolerance induction, but are not essential participants in the induction of systemic tolerance to orally introduced antigens given in larger doses.'",4
"b'CD4+ T lymphocytes usually recognize peptides of 12\x9616 amino acids in the context of HLA class II molecules. We have recently used synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries to dissect in detail antigen recognition by autoreactive CD4+ T cell clones (TCC). The results of these studies demonstrated that antigen recognition by T cells is highly degenerate and that many cross-reactive ligands can be defined, some of which much more potent than the selecting autoantigen. Based on these observations, we examined the response of a myelin basic protein-specific HLA class II-restricted CD4+ TCC to truncation variants of optimal ligands. Surprisingly, pentapeptides, tetrapeptides and even tripeptides derived from different segments of the optimal ligands were recognized by the TCC, and some were even more potent than the selecting autoantigen. In addition, these peptides enhanced the survival of the TCC at low concentration. The relevance of this finding was supported by the generation of pentapeptide-specific CD4+ TCC from peripheral blood lymphocytes. These observations not only change existing views on the length requirements for activation of CD4+ HLA class II-restricted T cells, but also extend our knowledge about the flexibility of TCR recognition and the potential for cross-reactivity in the immune system.'",4

"b'Background Deaths from maternal causes represent the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age in most developing countries. It is estimated that the highest risk occurs in Africa, with 20% of world births but 40% of the world maternal deaths. The level of maternal mortality is difficult to assess especially in countries without an adequate vital registration system. Indirect techniques are an attractive cost-effective tool to provide estimates of orders of magnitude for maternal mortality.\r\n\r\nMethod The level of maternal mortality estimated by the sisterhood method is presented for a rural district in the Morogoro Region of Southeastern Tanzania and the main causes of maternal death are studied. Information from region-specific data using the sisterhood method is compared to data from other sources.\r\n\r\nResults The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 448 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births (95%CI : 363\x96534 deaths per 100 000 live births). Maternal causes accounted for 19% of total mortality in this age group. One in 39 women who survive until reproductive age will die before age 50 due to maternal causes. The main cause of death provided by hospital data was puerperal sepsis (35%) and postpartum haemorrhage (17%); this is compatible with the main causes reported for maternal death in settings with high levels of maternal mortality, and similar to data for other regions in Tanzania. The sisterhood method provides data comparable with others, together with a cost-effective and reliable estimate for the determination of the magnitude of maternal mortality in the rural Kilombero District.'",3
"b'Background The Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986 released large quantities of radioactive material causing widespread contamination. In the Ukraine alone, more than 4 million people were exposed to radiation. The exact health consequences of this exposure are still being assessed.\r\n\r\nMethods To ascertain the effect of in utero radiation exposure and the development of leukaemia, a review was undertaken of leukaemia sub-types occurring among children born in the year of the accident (1986) and followed 10 years post-exposure. A comparison was made of leukaemia cumulative incidence rates among children from both an exposed and unexposed oblast.\r\n\r\nResults Rate ratios (RR) for the all cell types grouping of leukaemia revealed that rates in the exposed Oblast were significantly elevated for females, males and both genders combined. Rates of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were dramatically elevated for males and to a lesser extent for females. For both genders combined, the RR for ALL was more than three times greater in the exposed compared to the unexposed region.\r\n\r\nConclusion Study results suggest that the increased risk of leukaemia and acute leukaemia among those children born in 1986 and resident in radioactively contaminated territories may be associated with exposure to radiation resulting from the Chernobyl accident.'",3
"b'Long-standing ethanol consumption acts as a chronic cardiac stress and often leads to alcoholic cardiomyopathy. We have recently shown that the acute ethanol-induced depression in myocardial contraction was substantiated by chronic ethanol ingestion. Acetaldehyde (ACA), the main ethanol metabolite, has been considered to play a role in ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction. To evaluate the ACA-induced cardiac contractile response following chronic ethanol ingestion, mechanical properties were examined using left ventricular papillary muscles and myocytes from rats fed with control or ethanol-enriched diet. Muscles and myocytes were electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz and contractile properties analysed included peak tension development (PTD) and peak shortening (PS). Intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured as fura-2 fluorescence intensity changes ({Delta}FFI). Papillary muscles from ethanol-consuming animals exhibited reduced baseline PTD and attenuated responsiveness to increase of extracellular Ca2+. Acute ACA (0.3\x9610 mM) addition elicited a dose-dependent depression of PTD. However, the inhibition magnitude was significantly reduced in ethanol-treated rats. Myocytes from both control and ethanol-treated rats exhibited comparable ACA-induced depression in both PS and {Delta}FFI. Collectively, these data suggest that the ACA-induced depression of myocardial contraction is reduced at the multicellular level, but unchanged at the single cell level, following chronic ethanol ingestion.'",0
"b'The effect of blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the barrel cortex upon the learning-induced changes of the cortical body map was examined in adult mice. We have previously found that three sensory conditioning sessions, in which stimulation of a row of vibrissae was paired with a tail shock, produced an enlargement of the functional representation of a row of vibrissae stimulated during training. Implantation of the slow release polymer Elvax, containing 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV, 50 mM), in the vicinity of the barrel cortex was performed 1 day before conditioning to block NMDA receptors. The cortical representation of a trained row of vibrissae was visualized with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) functional brain mapping 1 day after the completion of the conditioning procedure. The partial blockade of NMDA receptors within the barrel cortex reduced (by half) the expansion of the cortical representation of a trained row of vibrissae as compared to the enlargement of the cortical representation of a trained row found in untreated (60%) and Elvax\x96PBS implanted (47%) mice. The results provide evidence that the learning-induced processes of cortical map reorganization involve mechanisms that depend on NMDA receptor activation.'",1
"b'Background Before universal infant immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 1986 China was a region endemic for HBV infection. The prevalence of HBV infection in the population was about 60% and the proportion of chronic HBV carriers around 10%. These HBV carriers could progress to chronic hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Since 1976, large-scale sero-surveys of HBV infection have been carried out and a lot of data have been collected.\r\n\r\nMethod This paper describes a mathematical model developed to predict the dynamics of HBV transmission and to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the vaccination programme. We used a compartment model expressed by a set of partial differential equations based on the characteristics of HBV infection.\r\n\r\nResults All parameters, expressed in the model as a non-linear function of age and time since vaccination, were estimated using sero-survey data. The model fits well with both pre-vaccination and post-vaccination sero-surveys. The observed and estimated age-specific prevalence rates of HBV infection and HBV carriage agree with each other. According to our model, if all newborns are vaccinated according to schedule, the rate of HBV carriage will decline sharply over time to 0.2% in 70 years. By then, the ratio of acute hepatitis B will be less than 0.5% and the ratio of chronic hepatitis B will be around 5%.\r\n\r\nConclusions The results suggest that HBV infection in China can be controlled in just one generation, and eventually eliminated. Our model shows that vaccination coverage is the most important indicator for the elimination of HBV transmission. The higher the vaccination coverage, the better the long-term effectiveness of immunization. Thus, the key to controlling and eliminating HBV transmission in China is to find ways to immunize all infants throughout the country, especially in poor, rural areas.'",3
"b'We examined the nature and the selectivity of the motion deficits produced by lesions of extrastriate areas MT and MST. Lesions were made by injecting ibotenic acid into the representation of the left visual field in two macaque monkeys. The monkeys discriminated two stimuli that differed either in stimulus direction or orientation. Direction and orientation discrimination were assessed by measuring thresholds with gratings and random-dots placed in the intact or lesioned visual fields. At the start of behavioral testing, we found pronounced, motion-specific deficits in thresholds for all types of moving stimuli, including pronounced elevations in contrast thresholds and in signal-to-noise thresholds measured with moving gratings, as well as deficits in direction range thresholds and motion coherence measured with random-dot stimuli. In addition, the accuracy of direction discrimination was reduced at smaller spatial displacements (i.e. step sizes), suggesting an increase in spatial scale of the residual directional mechanism. Subsequent improve- ments in thresholds were seen with all motion stimuli, as behavioral training progressed, and these improvements occurred only with extensive behavioral testing in the lesioned visual field. These improvements were particularly pronounced for stimuli not masked by noise. On the other hand, deficits in the ability to extract motion from noisy stimuli and in the accuracy of direction discrimination persisted despite extensive behavioral training. These results demonstrate the importance of areas MT and MST for the perception of motion direction, particularly in the presence of noise. In addition, they provide evidence for the importance of behavioral training for functional recovery after cortical lesions. The data also strongly support the idea of functional specialization of areas MT and MST for motion processing.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'This paper reviews architectonic subdivisions and connections of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) in rats, monkeys and humans. Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of \x91medial\x92 and \x91orbital\x92 networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory\x96visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to be critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.'",1
"b'We recently described a panel of cytotoxic murine NK cell clones that also enhanced Ig secretion by B cells activated in an in vitro model of T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) responses. We employed dextran-conjugated anti-IgD ({alpha}{delta}-dex) as a model antigen. Here we study the mechanism of Ig induction by these clones. Addition of the various NK clones to sort-purified B cells stimulated with {alpha}{delta}-dex and IL-2 resulted in a markedly heterogeneous increase in Ig secretion, which varied from 3-fold, as mediated by clone PKO 56, to 15-fold, as induced by clone PKO 101. The other NK cells showed intermediate levels of Ig induction. Furthermore, while addition of as few as 0.04% of PKO 101 cells stimulated significant increases and 1% induced near maximum Ig production, a 3% addition of PKO 56 cells was required for significant enhancement of Ig secretion. Supernatant material collected from the NK clones mediated Ig production at levels that mirrored the induction by the corresponding cells. Cytokine analysis showed that while all members of the NK panel produced IFN-{gamma}, only two secreted granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and that the levels of Ig induction mediated by the NK clones correlated only with their levels of IFN-{gamma} secretion. Culture of B and NK cells in the presence of anti-IFN-{gamma} demonstrated that IFN-{gamma} was the critical cytokine in NK-induced Ig production. These findings establish heterogeneity in the ability of NK cells to increase Ig secretion in vitro and show that NK-produced IFN-{gamma} is an important factor in determining this heterogeneity.'",4
"b""Previous studies illustrated the influence of T cell subsets on susceptibility or resistance to demyelination in the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model of multiple sclerosis. Genetic segregation analysis showed a correlation with disease phenotype in this model with particular V\xdf genes. In this study we investigated the contribution of specific V\xdf TCR to the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelinating disease. Spectratype analysis of cells infiltrating the CNS early in infection demonstrated an over-representation of V\xdf8+ T cells in mice expressing a susceptible H-2 haplotype. We infected transgenic mice expressing the V\xdf8.2 TCR directed against a non-TMEV antigen and found an increase in demyelinating disease in mice of either susceptible or resistant background compared with littermate controls. In addition, depletion studies with an anti-V\xdf8-specific antibody in both susceptible (B10.Q) and resistant (C57BL/6) mice resulted in increased demyelination. TCR analysis of VP2-specific cytotoxic T cell clones from mice with a resistant genotype identified only the V\xdf8.1 TCR, suggesting that limited T cell diversity is critical to TMEV clearance. Together, these results support a protective role for V\xdf8+ T cells in virus-induced demyelinating disease.""",4
"b""Although research into social and behavioural determinants of health and illness was conducted throughout the 20th century, it has become more common since the 1980s. Because of this, the term \x91social epidemiology\x92 is increasingly encountered in the biomedical literature.\r\n\r\nRecent commentaries by Kaufman and Cooper1,2 and Muntaner3 on causal explanations in social epidemiology, although of interest to the research field, take the term \x91social epidemiology\x92 for granted. With reference to Syme4 and Susser et al.,5 the authors claim that social epidemiology is \x91a distinctly recognised specialisation within epidemiology\x92, and has been for some 30 to 40 years.\r\n\r\nThis field of research has been defined as the science which studies the link between social environment and the development and distribution of disease in populations,1,6,7 a definition which emphasizes a hybrid area of interest between sociology and epidemiology. Apparently, the term social epidemiology is so established that it is even used to describe the frequency of behaviour, without any reference to disease.8,9\r\n\r\nEpidemiology has evolved into many different fields of application, leading to specialities such as occupational epidemiology, cancer epidemiology, and pharmaco-epidemiology. Can \x91social epidemiology\x92 be regarded as just another branch? No, we believe the term is a misnomer.\r\n\r\nEpidemiology is part of medical science and rests on a human-biological (scientific) background. Biomedical theory about, e.g. carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, and teratogenesis is the input for scientific discussion and empirical studies in epidemiology. All epidemiological hypotheses are, or at least should be, derived from such theories by deductive reasoning. Similarly, results of epidemiological studies are used to adapt these biomedical theories by inductive reasoning. Therefore, every epidemiologist should have a basic training in biomedicine, comparable to the training that medical practitioners need as a basis for medical practice.\r\n\r\nIn broader terms: epidemiology, like every other discipline derived from medicine, rests on a human-biological (scientific) background.\r\n\r\nFrequency research (the most succinct characterization of epidemiology) is also an important approach in other scientific fields, including psychology and sociology. Unlike epidemiology however, empirical studies to assess the (determinants of) frequency of psychological problems rely predominantly on socio-psychological theories. Should we call this \x91psycho-epidemiology\x92 or \x91social epidemiology\x92? An argument in favour of using the term epidemiology outside the field of biomedicine is to stress the similarities in methodology: the statistical approach. But epidemiology is not just defined by its statistical outlook, nor is sociology or psychology. Epidemiology deals with medical knowledge itself. Similarly, sociology and psychology deal primarily with the subject-matter of behaviour (including behaviour related to health and disease) of societies and individuals.\r\n\r\nAn epidemiologist confronted with a research problem from the field of sociology or psychology is merely a technician who knows how to handle statistics with only a layman's ideas on the topics that are statistically described. Similarly, a sociologist has his common sense only to rely on when confronted with a medical problem. Unless scientists obtain a thorough training in both biomedicine and social sciences, they cannot contribute to scientific development in both areas. In fact, those who use the term \x91social epidemiology\x92 acknowledge the failure of this \x91field\x92 to identify underlying mechanisms that account for the relation between social environment and health outcomes.3,7\r\n\r\nWe therefore believe that epidemiologists, sociologists and psychologists should stick to their field of scientific inquiry. This does not imply that epidemiologists cannot use social or psychological determinants (income, stress) or outcomes (e.g. quality of life) in their studies. But even then, biomedical theory should link these items to the core parameters of a study (e.g. income as a determinant for nutritional status; stress as a determinant for hormonal imbalance; quality of life as a sequel of particular diseases). Similarly, sociologists and psychologists may enter medically defined variables (e.g. mortality, infertility) into their studies.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a statement of purity. We firmly believe that shopping in neighbouring scientific fields, without thorough subject-matter knowledge, will lead to statistical results without relevant meaning. As a consequence, research is reduced to statistically correct procedures without proper inference. Stretching borders between epidemiology as a biomedical discipline and sociology only leads to trivial statements, useless for society.""",3
"b""I would like to announce to our readership that the current issue, the last of this year, is the final issue of my Chief Editorship of Alcohol and Alcoholism. The end of my tenure as the Medical Council on Alcohol (MCA) Chief Editor marks the culmination of a 26-year association with this journal in various capacities, as Assistant Editor for 2 years (from 1978), Deputy Editor for 14 years (from 1980) and finally as Chief Editor for 10 years (from 1994). During this long and happy association, I have been privileged to witness and participate in events and activities which saw the transformation of this publication from essentially a newsletter aimed primarily at the UK general practitioner to a biomedical multidisciplinary scientific journal, arguably the premier European in its category, of a wider international reputation. Although this transformation took place over many years of sustained activity by successive editors, I am pleased to acknowledge and to remind our readership that it was initiated by my distinguished predecessor, Dr Myrddin Evans. During his 2-year editorship of the journal (1978\x961979) (see Table 1) and his earlier activities as Deputy Editor, Dr Evans has been instrumental in single-handedly introducing scientific and other biomedical contributions to the journal.\r\n\r\nt is also clear from Table 1 that, since 1996, the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ESBRA), which adopted Alcohol and Alcoholism as its official journal in 1991, has contributed significantly to the editorial process through the appointment of an ESBRA co-Chief Editor, first Professor Keith Francis Tipton (1996\x962000), then Professor Gian Luigi Gessa (2001\x962003). I am very pleased to acknowledge their valuable contribution to the journal, which extended well beyond their internationally recognized and leading expertise in their own fields. The journal readership will also wish to know that Professor Gessa's tenure as the ESBRA Chief Editor will end simultaneously with mine; a pure coincidence! The adoption by ESBRA of Alcohol and Alcoholism as its official journal should be regarded as a key development in the history of this journal, as a result of which the journal is now perceived as the major European periodical in the alcoholism field, in addition to its international standing, with a major biomedical element. The ESBRA link is a great asset for this journal and I am confident that ESBRA will play a continuing major role in the development and progress of this publication.\r\nProfessor Gessa and I should like to take this opportunity to thank both the MCA and ESBRA for their confidence in our chief editorships, and the journal readership, particularly its contributors, for their support of the journal and their contribution to advancing its position. We believe that it is opportune at this important point in the history of Alcohol and Alcoholism, on the eve of the forthcoming changes in its chief editorships, to take stock and review briefly the progress of the journal over recent years.\r\n\r\nWe record with pleasure the sustained increase in submissions to the journal over the years, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Although journal editors generally work within the constraints of page budgets, my co-Chief Editors and I have always put the interest of science and scientists before commercial considerations, rather than taking the easier option of increasing the rejection rate, which has been around 45% for the past several years. We are pleased to acknowledge the support of this policy by both the MCA and our publisher, Oxford University Press (OUP) and are confident that both organizations will continue to support this policy under the leadership of our successors. Professor Gessa and I should also like to acknowledge the support and dedication of various members of the Editorial Team, past and present, without which it would not have been possible for us all as a single team to enable this multidisciplinary journal to achieve its current position so convincingly.\r\n\r\nAlong with increased submission, the journal Impact Factor (IF), for what it is worth, has also been increasing steadily over the years and is now at its highest level yet (Fig. 2). Our policy regarding the impact and standing of the journal has always been to emphasize the greater importance to our contributors of expeditious handling and processing of their submissions and their constructive and competent peer-reviewing. The speeds of the editorial process and of publication and of steps in between can all be judged for the chronological data provided for each paper in the current volume, and I believe that a faster turnaround will be achieved through uniform application in future of electronic systems at all stages of the publication process.\r\nn accordance with the requirements of the Farmington Consensus statement and the guidelines of the International Society for Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE), of which this journal is a founder member, I confirm that Alcohol and Alcoholism enjoys full editorial independence, is financially self-supporting and accrues income to both the MCA and OUP. During 2003, in addition to deriving income through donations from indiduals and from its own members and from its educational and publications activities, the journal owners, the MCA, has received funds from the UK Alcohol Education and Research Council, the Robertson Trust, the BBC, the Portman Group and Link Pharmaceuticals.\r\nEvolving commitments and interests necessitate changes to work schedules and commitments. Both Professor Gessa and I consider this an opportune moment to hand over the journal chief editorships to our successors, which will allow us to devote the time and energies required for our research activities. In particular, Gian Luigi Gessa will be able to concentrate on his exciting research on new alcoholism medications based on GABA-related and other mechanisms, in addition to his new role as President of the Italian Pharmacological Society. As for me, I shall be devoting a major part of my research time to developing my recent invention of a new deterrent and wider alcoholism-treatment therapy based on metabolites of the amino acid tryptophan. Although we shall both miss our frequent and direct pleasant interactions with our alcohol research colleagues worldwide, which have made our tasks all the more enjoyable, Professor Gessa and I both record our pleasure and satisfaction at leaving Alcohol and Alcoholism in an excellent shape, and, in saying farewell, we express every confidence in the continued success of the journal under the leadership of our two successors and their editorial team.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Background The Seven Countries Study has shown that population mortality rates for various chronic diseases are related to diet and smoking. This paper addresses the associations between diet, smoking and 25-year all-cause mortality.\r\n\r\nMethods Baseline surveys were carried out between 1958 and 1964 on 12 763 middle-aged men constituting 16 cohorts in seven countries. In 1987/88 equivalent food composites representing the average food intake of each cohort at baseline were collected and chemically analysed in one central laboratory. During 25 years of follow-up 5973 men died and age-adjusted population mortality rates were calculated for each cohort.\r\n\r\nResults Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the population intake of saturated fat and the prevalence of smoking were positively associated with population all-cause mortality rates. Population vitamin C intake was inversely associated with all-cause mortality. It was calculated that a reduction in saturated fat intake of 5% of energy, a 20 mg/d increase in vitamin C and a 10% decrease in the prevalence of smokers may decrease the 25-year all-cause population mortality rate by 12.4% (95% CI : 5.6, 19.4%) at an average population all-cause mortality rate of 45%.\r\n\r\nConclusion At the population level saturated fat, vitamin C and cigarette smoking are important determinants of all-cause mortality.'",3
"b'The adhesive interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells is required for the formation of the immunological synapse. Inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) is a third member of the CD28 family of co-stimulatory molecules. Here we describe a novel lymphocyte adhesion molecule, of relative molecular mass 47,000, designated AILIM, that is a rat homolog of ICOS. Rat AILIM was constitutively expressed on thymocytes and was induced on naive T cells after activation. Human thymoma cells bound to purified AILIM. Furthermore, cells transfected with the AILIM gene aggregated in an AILIM-dependent manner. These results suggest a novel function for AILIM/ICOS as an adhesion molecule, which plays an important role in T cell activation.'",4
"b""Since plants are emerging as an important system for the expression of recombinant glycoproteins, especially those intended for therapeutic purposes, it is important to scrutinize to what extent glycans harbored by mammalian glycoproteins produced in transgenic plants differ from their natural counterpart. We report here the first detailed analysis of the glycosylation of a functional mammalian glycoprotein expressed in a transgenic plant. The structures of the N-linked glycans attached to the heavy chains of the monoclonal antibody Guy's 13 produced in transgenic tobacco plants (plantibody Guy's 13) were identified and compared to those found in the corresponding IgG1 of murine origin. Both N-glycosylation sites located on the heavy chain of the plantibody Guy's 13 are N-glycosylated as in mouse. However, the number of Guy's 13 glycoforms is higher in the plant than in the mammalian expression system. Despite the high structural diversity of the plantibody N-glycans, glycosylation appears to be sufficient for the production of a soluble and biologically active IgG in the plant system. In addition to high-mannose-type N-glycans, 60% of the oligosaccharides N-linked to the plantibody have [beta](1, 2)-xylose and [alpha](1, 3)-fucose residues linked to the core Man3GlcNAc2. These plant-specific oligosaccharide structures are not a limitation to the use of plantibody Guy's 13 for topical immunotherapy. However, their immunogenicity may raise concerns for systemic applications of plantibodies in human.""",2
"b""Although a number of specific personality disorders, including anti-social personality, passive-dependent personality, and explosive personality, have been associated with the diagnosis of alcoholism, studies of the relationship of underlying personality and/or temperament to the nature, phenomenology, psychobiology, prognosis, and treatment of alcoholism have occurred much less frequently. However, there is a growing body of evidence that core or underlying personality and temperament are important determinants of vulnerability to becoming an alcoholic and of the nature of alcoholic subtypes. Furthermore, these personality and temperament variables appear linked to biological and/or genetic mechanisms. In parallel to human studies, experiments using rodents and primates have demonstrated animal behavioural characteristics, such as impulsivity, excessive or deficient behavioural inhibition, and a tendency to explore, which appear to parallel human personality characteristics, and these characteristics may predict genetically determined excessive alcohol consumption in animals.\r\n\r\nThis special section is devoted to the memory of our esteemed colleague, Dr Markku Linnoila, honouring his many contributions to the field of alcoholism research and specifically to the theme of this special section. It is derived from a symposium presented at the Ninth Congress of the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA), held during the period 27 June\x962 July 1998 in Copenhagen, Denmark.\r\n\r\nAs a world renowned expert on serotonin, Dr Linnoila led a team that was widely recognized as the world's leading research group investigating serotonin and behaviour. His work was particularly focused on the relationship between serotonin and personality and he published numerous papers showing a relationship between the two. His 1983 landmark research paper investigating serotonin, fire-setting, and violence, bridged three disparate research fields: suicide, alcoholism, and aggression, and showed that the common link between these serotonin-mediated psychopathologies was impulsivity. While pursuing cutting-edge research with scientists in his homeland of Finland, where he was able to investigate the biological correlates of personality in violent offenders and alcoholics, he forged a relationship with those who were investigating non-human primate personality, leading to the first comprehensive non-human primate model linking serotonin and psychopathology. This model has been instrumental in understanding the biological and psychosocial correlates of Type 2-like excessive alcohol consumption.\r\n\r\nIn this special section, we explore the interface between alcoholism, heritable personality factors, and biological and/or genetic characteristics in clinical and preclinical groups. Specifically, my colleagues and I describe heritable personality characteristics of detoxifying alcoholics as measured by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. We discuss the relationship of these characteristics to short-term relapse following detoxification, to the degree of compliance with attendance at self-help groups, and to the differences in personality profiles between \x91pure' and \x91dual diagnosis' depressed alcoholics. Dr David Overstreet and colleagues present a variety of preclinical studies indicating the existence of specific behavioural characteristics, such as sweet preference and emotionality, in genetically determined alcohol- preferring rat lines. These alcohol-preferring lines differ on a number of other behaviours, such as general activity and stress-induced immobility. Dr Alexei Kampov-Polevoi and colleagues discuss the relationship between a preference for high concentrations of sucrose, elevations in TPQ Novelty Seeking and Harm Avoidance scales, and the diagnosis of alcoholism in humans. They also review preclinical studies showing a link between saccharin preference and a genetic propensity to prefer alcohol. Dr Elisabetta Marchiori and colleagues summarize their studies suggesting a relationship between measured emotional dependency and a diagnosis of alcoholism associated with personality disorder. Finally, Drs Dee Higley and Allyson Bennett discuss their and Dr Linnoila's work demonstrating an interface between alcoholism, impulsivity, violent behaviour, and specific molecular and/or genetic (i.e. allelic) characteristics of the central serotonin system. This work also reviews the observed serotonin deficiency in impulsive and/or violent primates (including humans) who, when exposed to alcohol, consume large quantities.""",0
"b'Alcohol misuse is a major public health problem. In the UK, general practitioners are perceived as key players in prevention and management of alcohol problems, but may not be prepared sufficiently to undertake this work. A systematic review of the literature by computerized search of the Medline database, hand search of review article citations and a survey of relevant educational and training organizations and agencies were undertaken. Although there is no shortage of educational materials, there has been little evaluation of their effectiveness. A need for more training and support has been identified, but this requires better co-ordination and a more multidisciplinary approach. Forthcoming changes in the National Health Service and the organization of continuing professional development offer a unique opportunity to advance this agenda'",0
"b""Happy 2000 to all our readers, contributors, dedicated members of the Editorial Team and Editorial Advisory Board, and our expert independent referees, and to members, officers and staff of the Medical Council on Alcoholism (MCA), the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ESBRA), and our publisher, Oxford University Press (OUP). The new millennium is upon us and, as we promised last year (Badawy and Tipton, 1999Go), we consider it appropriate at this important landmark of the Christian (Western) Calendar to review the history of Alcohol and Alcoholism and its progress, and, in doing so, to pay tribute to its parent organization, the MCA, and to those individuals who have been instrumental in the development of both parent and child and their supporters.\r\n\r\nThe reader of this issue will see that invited special articles have been written, among which one (Nordmann, 2000Go) on ESBRA by its founding President Professor Roger Nordmann and another (Evans, 2000Go) on the MCA and its journal by the second of the journal Editors, Dr Myrddin Evans, in which he gives his particular thoughts on key issues in alcohol research and on those he considers important for the continuing development of the journal. Our main task here will therefore be to complement these two contributions, and indeed those by Professor Karl Mann (holder of the first Chair in Addiction Research in Germany) and his colleagues, on the history of alcohol research and treatment in the twentieth century (Mann et al., 2000Go) and by Dr Adriaan Potgieter on the activities of another European organization concerned with alcoholism research and treat-ment, the Plinius Maior Society (Potgieter, 2000Go), with our own \x91observer\x92 view of the MCA, specially from the journal perspective.\r\n\r\nAt the national (British) level, the development of Alcohol and Alcoholism and its parent organization the MCA, has been a continuous and very interesting success story, the credit for which goes to many persons, some of whom have departed this life, whereas others are still alive and well and we wish them all continued good health and prosperity. It would be both futile and incomplete if we were to attempt to name all those to whom this journal owes its existence and success, but one cannot proceed without singling out a few such persons. The first person is Professor Griffith Edwards, the distinguished Editor-in-Chief of the oldest substance misuse journal \x91Addiction\x92, who in 1962 suggested the need to produce a Bulletin under the aegis of the Camberwell Council on Alcoholism in south London. The second person and perhaps the most central figure in this context is the late Dr Herbert D. Chalke, founding Editor of our journal. As the then Medical Officer of Health for the Camberwell Council on Alcoholism, Dr Chalke produced the first Bulletin in June 1963 and the first printed Bulletin on 25 May 1965, the launch of which at BMA (British Medical Association) House was marked by presentations from Professor Francis Camps, Dr Lincoln Williams, Dr Basil Merriman, Dr Griffith Edwards and the Bishop of London.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Max Glatt, one of the original founders of the MCA, Professor Camps went on to become the main mover in the foundation of the MCA, together with Dr Chalke, Dr Noel Moynihan, Dr Richard Phillipson (a former Director of Army Psychiatry) and Dr Glatt. They were joined by Mr Clement Price-Thomas, Mr Lawrence Able and Dr Harold Stewart.\r\n\r\nDr Chalke was thus also a key figure in the creation of the MCA, and many of us therefore owe him a great debt. The Bulletin was transformed into \x91The Journal of Alcoholism\x92 with volume 1 in 1966. The title of the journal was subsequently changed twice, first to the \x91British Journal on Alcohol and Alcoholism\x92 with volume 12 in 1977, then to \x91Alcohol and Alcoholism\x92 with volume 18 in 1983. The journal continued to appear quarterly until 1988 when volume 23 and subsequent volumes appeared bi-monthly. A colourful and detailed, yet succinct, account of the efforts and activities of Dr Chalke and others in the early days of the Bulletin and the MCA has been written (Evans, 1990Go) by the third person to whom we wish to pay tribute, Dr Chalke's successor as second Editor of the journal, Dr Myrddin Evans. Dr Evans, who was Editor until 1980, continued the development of the journal and, of his various contributions and energetic management of the journal, perhaps the most significant is his successful introduction into the journal content of many important basic scientific studies on alcohol. This has been achieved thanks to his fine scientific intellect, great foresight, wide international links and a true belief in the value of the multi-disciplinary approach. In our opinion, Dr Evans' greatest achievement for the journal was his ability, almost single-handedly, to lead the \x91British Journal on Alcohol and Alcoholism\x92 to becoming perceived as an emerging multi-disciplinary journal with a major scientific content. In achieving this status for his journal, Dr Evans paved the way, before retiring in 1980, for its transformation to the international journal known today as \x91Alcohol and Alcoholism\x92 under the leadership of a new Editor-in-Chief, Dr Allan D. Thomson.Dr Thomson led a small team including one of us (A.A.-B.B.) and Dr J. Spencer Madden (both as Deputy Editors) in launching Alcohol and Alcoholism with volume 18 in 1983 and with a new publisher, Pergamon Press. Dr Madden has also had a long association with the MCA (having been one of the first elected members of the Executive in 1969) and is very much involved in its affairs, being currently one of its two Vice Chairmen and also Chairman of the Journal Committee, although he retired as Deputy Editor in July 1999. As stated previously (Badawy and Thomson, 1999Go), Dr Madden's Deputy Editorship was a distinguished one and he must be credited with making Alcohol and Alcoholism the truly multi-disciplinary journal it is today. Dr Thomson has consolidated the successes of his predecessor, developed the strong biomedical character of the journal, publicised and promoted the journal world wide and generally established Alcohol and Alcoholism as an international biomedical journal. The standing of the journal has thus risen under his leadership and his ultimate contribution must surely be the adoption by ESBRA of Alcohol and Alcoholism as its official journal, and we also acknowledge here the roles played by the Founding President of ESBRA, Professor Roger Nordmann and its Secretary/Treasurer and subsequently second President, Dr Philippe De Witte. With this important European recognition, Alcohol and Alcoholism now has two Chief Editors representing MCA and ESBRA, and we are both fortunate in having taken on the privilege and responsibility of managing this journal from such good hands.\r\n\r\nWe should now like to turn our attention to the journal itself and its current position and to sound a note of optimism for its future. Over the past five successive years, the standing of Alcohol and Alcoholism has risen steadily without exception. The Impact Factor (IF) of the journal, for what it is worth, has been increasing all the time (0.952 in 1993; 1.026 in 1994; 1.145 in 1995; 1.423 in 1996; 1.536 in 1997 and 1.550 in 1998), as has the number of submissions (96 in 1996; 123 in 1997; 136 in 1998 and 143 so far until the end of November 1999). Alcohol and Alcoholism has now maintained its position as fourth in the category of substance misuse journals for the second year running, against the expected fluctuation experienced by most other journals. However, as a truly multi-disciplinary journal with a major biomedical content, we consider Alcohol and Alcoholism to be the premier European journal in the field, second only to the North American journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. We are confident that our author-friendly policies and our fair, competent and expeditious handling system have played a key role in the current perception of our journal. We shall strive to ensure that our policies meet the expectations and aspirations of alcohol researchers in their various disciplines, and we assure our potential contributors that we value the Editor\x96Author partnership and regard it as the key to successful scientific publishing.\r\n\r\nThe readers of this issue will see that the journal is now printed in a larger (A4) format, which brings it in line with most other journals. This format was primarily selected to meet the increased demand on our pages necessitated by the continually rising level of submissions.\r\n\r\nThe journal is also now on line (http://www.oup.co.uk/alcalc/). Since 1995, the journal has been published by OUP, who, under the guidance and management of Mr Steve Johnson and now Ms Mandy Sketch, and our Production Editor Ms Nancy Hillelson, have been responsible not only for the production of a high-quality publication, but also its promotion within the scientific community worldwide. We greatly value the support and interest of our Oxford publisher OUP.\r\n\r\nWe should now like to return to the \x91parent\x92. There can be no doubt in the minds of those who have read so far about the achievements of the MCA. Readers of this journal who are not members of MCA, or aware of its activities, should know that, as well as publishing Alcohol and Alcoholism as an international scientific journal for experts in the alcoholism field worldwide, the MCA also publishes a bi-monthly newsletter \x91Alcoholism\x92 aimed primarily towards general practitioners and other primary healthcare providers, and performs a variety of other educational activities for the medical and allied professions in the United Kingdom. For example, the MCA holds seminars for medical students and symposia for clinical and other researchers and practitioners, advises a number of official medical and health organizations, publishes handbooks for medical students and nurses, has a network of regional advisors attached to various university medical schools and health authorities and has a high profile in activities addressing important medical issues on alcoholism and alcohol problems at a variety of levels (e.g. in the workplace and among the medical professions). For those who wish to gain a closer insight into the history and development of the MCA, the review by Evans (1990) in this journal is an excellent source worthy of study. In our view, two aspects of MCA's achievements stand out most prominently. The first is the ability of MCA to perform all the above functions effectively with limited resources, and the second is its flagship Alcohol and Alcoholism, as described by its present Executive Director, Dr Peter Abraham, in the MCA's 1999 Annual Report (Abraham, 1999Go). The former could not have been possible without the dedication, leadership and guidance of successive MCA Presidents, Chairmen and Executive Directors and the support of other officers and ordinary members. We salute them all and are certain of the continued success and progress of the MCA under the wise leadership of its current President Sir Leslie Turnberg, Chairman Dr Bruce Ritson and Executive Director Dr Peter Abraham. At the international and scientific level, there is no doubt that \x91a successful international journal is the most esteemed of all products of a special interest medical society\x92 (Evans, 1990Go). The success of Alcohol and Alcoholism, in our opinion, is a testimony to both the foresight of successive MCA officers and the dedicated work of successive Editors. We are confident of the continued success of the journal of the MCA and its ESBRA partners and thus enter the new millennium with the greatest of optimism.""",0
"b'Alcohol misuse frequently leads to muscle weakness, which may also occur in the setting of acute and chronic alcoholic myopathies. At the cellular level, ethanol has been found to interfere with signalling mechanisms in cardiac myocytes, skeletal myotubes, and smooth muscle cells. In this study, we focused on the effects of ethanol on the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transients responsible for excitation\x96contraction (EC) coupling in isolated mouse skeletal fibres loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Following electrical stimulation, ethanol caused a significant reversible dose-dependent reduction in [Ca2+]i transient amplitude, already significant at 100 mM ethanol (P = 0.03), without modifying resting [Ca2+]i. Evaluating the potential loci for the effects of ethanol, we indirectly measured sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry by monitoring Mn2+-quenching of intracellular fura-2 via the nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels during electrical pacing. Ethanol at doses of 20 mM and greater caused a dose-dependent reduction in the rate of fura-2 quenching (all at P < 0.05). Moreover, the intracellular pool of Ca2+ releasable by caffeine was found to be reduced at a minimum of 300 mM ethanol (P = 0.05). We conclude that ethanol reduces the [Ca2+]i transients underlying EC coupling in single mouse skeletal muscle fibres. This acute effect of ethanol was primarily due to an inhibitory effect of ethanol on sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via voltage-operated Ca2+-channels and, to a lesser extent, to a reduction in the Ca2+ sarcoplasmic reticulum loading state. This inhibitory effect of ethanol may be implicated in the development of muscle weakness with alcohol consumption.'",0
"b'Background Perinatal deaths have been more difficult to prevent than infant deaths in low- income countries due to its close relation to poor maternal outcome. The aim of the study was to perform a comprehensive population-based analysis of perinatal mortality in a high mortality setting and to determine the impact of midwifery-assisted home deliveries.\r\n\r\nMethod The study design was a community-based cohort study. In all, 4876 perinatal deaths were recorded among 116 211 newborns in the districts of Sundsvall and Skellefte\xe5 in northern Sweden during the years 1831\x961899. Relative risks, 95% CI, population attributable proportions and prevented fractions were calculated.\r\n\r\nResults The overall perinatal mortality rate was 42.0 per 1000 births. A previous stillbirth represented one of the most important risk factors (RR = 3.25, 95% CI : 2.97\x963.56), with a population attributable proportion of 7%. Two or more previous stillbirths gave an RR of 8.50 (95% CI : 7.58\x969.53) and a population attributable proportion of 4%. There was an increased risk of perinatal mortality for mothers over 35 years old, the primiparous and the unmarried, while grandparous women had a higher perinatal mortality that was accounted for completely by a poor history of previous stillbirths and infant deaths among these women. The children of crofters, farmers and workers had higher perinatal mortality, but area had no significant impact. During the years 1881\x961890 and 1891\x961899, the prevented fractions of midwifery were 15% and 32%, respectively.\r\n\r\nConclusion Poor reproductive history, particularly previously high perinatal mortality, is associated with high perinatal mortality. Midwifery-assisted at home deliveries successfully reduced perinatal mortality.'",3
"b""The pronounced increase in lung cancer is a fact that has been established repeatedly in the years since 1920. The reason for this increase has been attributed to a range of circumstances by different authors. Most importantly, certain air pollutants have been investigated. Lung cancer due to occupational exposures is relevant in this context, which in the case of the Schneeberg lung cancer and cancer due to chromate or asbestos is recognized as an occupational disease. Exposure to exhaust fumes of motors, which are inhaled in many occupations but also by the general public in cities and on main roads, has also been examined. To this day it has not, however, been convincingly shown that increased inhalation of such fumes leads to an increase in carcinoma of the lung. Arguments against this notion include the experiments of Schmidtmann,8 the fact that country and city dwellers contribute to the same extent to the increase in lung cancer, and that occupations dealing with combustion engines are not particularly frequent among the diseased. The observation that the male gender is much more frequently afflicted by carcinoma of the lung than the female does not exactly support the notion that this cancer is predominantly caused by exhaust fumes because both genders are exposed to almost the same degree. The marked predominance of the male gender in lung cancer (six times more men than women contracted the disease in our material) suggests important internal factors in the development of the disease. However, there is also an external factor, which is much more common in men than in women: smoking. It has indeed repeatedly been pointed out that a close association between the increase in tobacco consumption and carcinoma of the lung could exist. In the first instance this assumption is supported by the results from experimental cancer research.\r\n\r\nRoffo et al.6 have successfully induced cancer by applying tar extracted from tobacco. Roffo also showed that the same tar contained the strongly carcinogenic benzpyrene. Taking into account that the tobacco consumed by a heavy smoker in 10 years would yield 4 kilograms of tar, it follows that considerable damage could be done to the epithelium of the airways, in particular if the smoke is inhaled.\r\n\r\nIn clinical research attempts have also been undertaken to prove the association between tobacco consumption and carcinoma of the lung. M\xfcller5 ascertained the amount of tobacco consumed in 86 men diagnosed with lung cancer during a certain period of time and compared it to that consumed by 86 healthy men of the same age. His figures show that a much greater proportion of patients with lung cancer were heavy smokers than would be expected while, to the contrary, non-smokers and moderate smokers were more frequent among controls than among lung cancer patients. M\xfcller therefore concluded that the increase in carcinoma of the lung is, at least to an important degree, due to the increase in tobacco consumption.\r\n\r\nTo us the data of M\xfcller seemed to be very significant in relation to the lung cancer problem. We considered, however, that further investigations were necessary to show their general validity. In the material of the Pathological Institute in Jena we had, as had Berblinger2 earlier, observed a substantial absolute and relative increase in carcinoma of the lung while, for example, stomach cancer did not show such an increase. Table 1Go which shows the increase in lung cancer during the years 1910 to 1939 was taken from the dissertation of W\xfcstner.10 This increase continued in the war years until 1941. The number of bronchial carcinomas as a proportion of the number of autopsies among patients older than 20 years was 3.61% in the year 1940 and 2.95% in the year 1941.\r\nIn line with the work of M\xfcller we investigated tobacco consumption among our lung cancer material (the years 1930 to 1941, 195 cases). We sent a questionnaire, which was similar to the one designed by M\xfcller, to the relatives, most of whom were resident in Thuringia. We asked whether or not the deceased had smoked, what his daily tobacco consumption was, and whether or not he may have cut down on the amounts smoked or stopped, particularly during the illness. Furthermore, we investigated his occupation and possible occupational damage due to air pollution. The same questionnaires were sent to the relatives of patients who died from cancers of the stomach, colon, prostate, oesophagus and tongue during the same time period. We thus intended to get material for comparison which was as complete as possible, allowing an assessment of the influence of smoking on other types of cancer. As shown in Table 2Go, about 50 to 60% of questionnaires were completed such that they could be analysed, for example 109 out of 195 in the case of lung cancer.\r\nFurthermore, we sent questionnaires to 700 men aged 53 and 54 years (corresponding to the mean age of 53.9 years of our lung cancer deaths) in order to ascertain their tobacco consumption before the war and during the war. Only 270 men completed these questionnaires in a satisfactory manner.\r\nThe results from these surveys are listed in Table 2Go. The first column shows the total number of cases, the second column the number of usable responses, in the following columns the data are separated into men and women. One sees that for lung cancer there are six times as many usable responses for men as for women, corresponding to the six times greater number of cases. The same is observed for cancers of the oesophagus and tongue, whereas the gender ratio is about 2:1 for cancers of the stomach and colon.\r\n\r\nAmong women there were only two light and one moderate smokers (see last column of Table 2Go) and they were therefore excluded from further analyses. The men are stratified according to their tobacco consumption (before development of the disease) in four additional columns of Table 2Go. Here we used the categories of Lickint.4 According to him, a light smoker smokes 1 cigar or up to 5 cigarettes per day; a moderate smoker 2 cigars or 6\x9610 cigarettes per day; a heavy smoker 3\x964 cigars or 11\x9620 cigarettes daily; a very heavy smoker more than 4 cigars or more than 20 cigarettes daily.\r\n\r\nIt is already very clear from Table 2Go that in comparison with patients with stomach cancer or normal controls, non-smokers are fairly rare whereas heavy smokers and, particularly, very heavy smokers are strongly represented among patients with carcinoma of the lung. An association similar to lung cancer is observed for tongue and oesophageal cancer. For these two cancers the number of cases are, however, too small to allow statistical analysis. The number of cancers of the colon and prostate is also quite small, we therefore combined those cancers for which an influence of smoking was not probable into one group\r\nIn Table 3Go we give the number of non-smokers, light, moderate and heavy smokers (we combined the groups of heavy and very heavy smokers from Table 2Go) as percentages for each of the three main cancer groups (lung cancer, stomach cancer, colon and prostate cancer) to allow immediate comparison. The female cases were hereby not included because women, with the exemption of a tiny minority, were non-smokers. In the same manner, we present as a fourth group all male cancer cases examined by us, corresponding to about two thirds of the total number of male cancer cases in this time period, and as a fifth group the normal controls.\r\nIt is evident from Table 3Go that the distribution of cases across the different smoking categories differs quite markedly between different types of cancer. Among lung cancer patients we find the fewest non-smokers and the highest proportion of heavy smokers, among stomach cancer patients, on the contrary, the highest proportion of non-smokers and light smokers and the fewest heavy smokers. The percentages in the group of colon and prostate cancer fall about mid way between the former two, as well, as expected, the percentages for all types of cancer combined. The results for the normal population are again to be found between those for stomach cancer and colon and prostate cancer. One thus gains the impression that lung cancer is much more frequent among heavy smokers, and much rarer among non-smokers, than colon and prostate cancer. Conversely, heavy smokers appear to be relatively rare among patients with stomach cancer, even in comparison with colon, prostate cancer or normal controls. The differences between lung cancer on the one hand, stomach cancer and normal population on the other are, as far as the groups of non-smokers and heavy smokers are concerned, statistically certain. Conversely, the differences between colon and prostate cancer on the one hand and lung or stomach cancer on the other are at best statistically probable.\r\n\r\nAs reported above, M\xfcller5 concluded that in his material from Cologne heavy smokers are more likely to contract lung cancer than non-smokers or light smokers. A comparison of our results with his results is fraught with difficulties in so far as M\xfcller used different categories for smokers. His \x91heavy to extreme\x92 smokers correspond approximately to our \x91heavy\x92 and \x91very heavy\x92 smokers; his \x91light\x92 smokers to our \x91light\x92 and \x91moderate\x92 smokers. On this basis we made a comparison in Table 4Go, again giving percentages. One sees that the figures from Cologne and Jena essentially correspond to each other. Heavy smokers are, however, more frequent in the normal population in Cologne than in Jena, the same being evident among patients with lung cancer. The differences between the normal population and patients with carcinoma of the lung are statistically certain in M\xfcller's material for the group of heavy smokers and non-smokers.\r\n\r\nThe relatively high proportion of non-smokers, 15% to 16% in the comparison groups of both Cologne and Jena is peculiar. The percentage of non-smokers has, for example by Lickint,4 been estimated to be considerably lower (5\x9610%). One could imagine that the age groups considered here perhaps smoke not as much as younger people. The suspicion nevertheless arises that some interviewees did not report their tobacco consumption entirely honestly. This applies to the Cologne comparison group. Our comparison material also has some weaknesses. Out of 700 questionnaires only 270, not even half, were completed satisfactorily. It is to be feared that for some considerations related to the war played a part when completing the questionnaire. One could image that therefore more heavy smokers than non-smokers refrained from answering and that in this way an unbalanced selection occurred.\r\nSuch considerations should, however, not have played a role in our other comparison groups, stomach cancer and colon and prostate cancer. Here the surveys were conducted in exactly the same way as for lung cancer. A comparison of the material is therefore perfectly possible and admissible. As already mentioned, differences emerged in comparisons with lung cancer.\r\n\r\nThis applies in particular to the group with stomach cancer. The distribution across the various smoking categories corresponds almost to that among the \x91normal male\x92 population, although heavy smokers are even less frequent than among the latter. If we could assume that our surveys really represent an average of the normal population then we could conclude that no relationship exists between stomach cancer and smoking. We have, however, reasons to assume that among our \x91normal population\x92 there were too many non-smokers and too few heavy smokers. We must consider that among stomach cancer patients there were particularly few heavy smokers and particularly many non-smokers and light smokers. This may perhaps be explained by the fact that some of the patients with stomach cancer had suffered from a \x91weak stomach\x92 for some time and therefore refrained from heavy smoking.\r\n\r\nThe differences in tobacco consumption between patients with stomach cancer and lung cancer are, however, not explained by a more pronounced reduction in smoking during the course of the illness among stomach cancer patients. This is clearly evident from Table 5Go. The table shows, in percentages, how many refrained from consumption or reduced it during their last illness. One sees that this was the case in equal measure for the two types of cancer.\r\n\r\nThe group of colon and prostate cancer also shows, as is evident from Table 3Go, considerable differences compared to lung cancer. The distribution of the various categories of smoking in this group corresponds largely to the group which combines all examined male cancers. Any relationship between smoking and the development of colon and prostate cancer is, in our view, unlikely. We would therefore believe that the distribution of smoking in this group is most likely to correspond to the norm. Unfortunately, the number of cases is relatively small (73), such that the average error becomes relatively large. The difference compared to lung cancer, which seems substantial, is therefore statistically uncertain. The difference between lung cancer on the one hand and the group of all cancers on the other is also only likely (for the groups of heavy smokers and non-smokers).\r\nWhen drawing conclusions from the material which is available so far (including M\xfcller's material) we can say that there is a high probability in support of the contention that lung cancer develops much more frequently among heavy smokers and is much rarer among non-smokers than expected in general. Unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to collect completely flawless material for comparison, or the sample was too small to allow statistically certain conclusions. The task, therefore, remains to study the relationship between smoking and lung cancer in a larger sample. The same applies to the entirely different relationship found for stomach cancer.\r\n\r\nThe question of how these differences in tobacco consumption may be generated deserves some brief comment. Concerning stomach cancer one can, as discussed above, only imagine that in many cases a \x91sensitive\x92 stomach leads to moderation in smoking as well as to the development of cancer. An inhibitory effect of heavy tobacco consumption on the development of stomach cancer is unlikely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it seems logical to consider that high tobacco consumption has a promoting effect in the case of lung cancer. This is supported by the concomitant increase in tobacco consumption and lung cancer in the past decades. Tar and carcinogenic substances contained in tobacco could hereby play an important part. The results of our survey, which are shown in Table 5Go, are clear evidence against the assumption that the increased tobacco consumption was a consequence of patients smoking more for palliation. According to our findings most patients stopped or reduced smoking during their illness and only a few smoked more.\r\n\r\nWe thus have to assume that heavy smoking is a cause of the increase in lung cancer. It cannot, however, be the sole cause of lung cancer as a few non-smokers are also afflicted by cancer. But we can assume that smoking is a very important cause leading an existing pre-disposition to proceed to the development of lung cancer. We are reminded here of the experiments which showed that in mice, which themselves have only a moderate pre-disposition for lung cancer, the additional application of tar or carcinogenic substances produced a much larger number of lung cancers (Anderfont1). There are numerous other examples, which show that in a terrain that is already prepared for it, additional stimuli can produce cancer. Rous and Friedl\xe4nder,7 for example, showed that treatment of virus-induced papillomata with methylcholanthrene provokes a rapid transformation to cancer in rabbits.\r\n\r\nWe attempted to assess other external causes of lung cancer, in particular pollution of ambient air, by designing our questionnaire correspondingly. Our material does not, however, provide any clues. Fifty-two of our patients with lung cancer had a dust-free occupation. Thirteen were occupationally exposed to stone dust, ten were exposed to metal dust. Further details are given by W\xfcstner10 and Sch\xf6niger.9 All occupations were represented in about the same proportion as in the normal population. An increase of workers who deal with lead, as found by M\xfcller in his material, was not evident among our cases. A particular increase of lung cancer in silicosis (slate and porcelain workers) was not observed either. Lung cancer was associated with tuberculosis in 10 out of 189 cases (W\xfcstner), and once with actinomycosis of the lung. From these figures a causal association cannot be derived either. There was no evidence for a relationship with previous bouts of flu (Berblinger2) or with scars in the lungs (Friedrich3) to the presence of which we paid particular attention in recent times. Once a localized scar had been found it was never clear whether it should be seen as a consequence of the bronchial cancer (collapse and consolidation).\r\nFollowing the studies of M\xfcller (Cologne) an investigation into the consumption of tobacco was conducted among cancer cases of the Pathological Institute in Jena, and among a comparison group from the normal male population of the same age in Jena.\r\n\r\nWe could confirm the report of M\xfcller that non-smokers rarely get lung cancer whereas heavy smokers get it more frequently than the average. Conversely, we found few heavy smokers and many non-smokers and light smokers among patients with stomach cancer.\r\n\r\nOur comparison material was less than satisfactory and the association between heavy tobacco consumption and lung cancer is therefore statistically, and causally, only likely. In order to confirm this association, larger investigations are required which we hope to stimulate with the present investigation.""",3
"b'Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, ligand-gated and highly permeable to calcium, are good candidates for transducing signals received by migrating cells, growth cones and developing synapses. The level of calcium in growth cones is important for axon guidance. Further, cyclic nucleotides, whose levels can be altered by nitric oxide and other transmitters, are known to alter growth cone motility. We use rat visual cortex as a model in our semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization studies to determine the developmental time course and localization of all three CNG family members (rod, olfactory and cone/testis). We demonstrate that in the cortex, the three channel subtypes are each expressed in a distinct temporal and spatial pattern in only sensorimotor and occipital regions of the cortex. Specifically, the rod and olfactory subtypes are present at the time of migration and rapid dendritic outgrowth, and the cone/testis subtype is highly expressed after eye opening. These results suggest CNG channels may play a role in both early and late events in visual cortical development.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Visual and auditory motion information can be used together to provide complementary information about the movement of objects. To investigate the neural substrates of such cross-modal integration, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess brain activation while subjects performed separate visual and auditory motion discrimination tasks. Areas of unimodal activation included the primary and/or early sensory cortex for each modality plus additional sites extending toward parietal cortex. Areas conjointly activated by both tasks included lateral parietal cortex, lateral frontal cortex, anterior midline and anterior insular cortex. The parietal site encompassed distinct, but partially overlapping, zones of activation in or near the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). A subsequent task requiring an explicit cross-modal speed comparison revealed several foci of enhanced activity relative to the unimodal tasks. These included the IPS, anterior midline, and anterior insula but not frontal cortex. During the unimodal auditory motion task, portions of the dorsal visual motion system showed signals depressed below resting baseline. Thus, interactions between the two systems involved either enhancement or suppression depending on the stimuli present and the nature of the perceptual task. Together, these results identify human cortical regions involved in polysensory integration and the attentional selection of cross-modal motion information.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'In the H-2Z1 mouse line, postnatal expression of the lacZ containing transgene in the cerebral cortex is restricted to layer IV neurons of the somatosensory area. We have used H-2Z1 embryos in previous heterotopic transplantation experiments to investigate the chronology of determination of areal identity. From the onset of neurogenesis, the cortex was regionalized in domains fated to express or not the somatosensory area-specific transgene. Determination occured 1 day later. In the present study, we show that, in vivo, H-2Z1 expression coincides with invasion of the cortical plate by thalamic afferents. We therefore investigated the role of thalamic innervation in the onset of H-2Z1 expression. For this purpose, we examined the pattern of H-2Z1 expression in perinatal cortical explant, in reeler mutant and MaoA deficient mice, or in animals which had received neonatal lesions affecting the somatosensory cortex or the thalamocortical projection. We found that, around birth, a switch occurs in the control of H-2Z1 expression: whereas H-2Z1 expression developed autonomously in embryonic parietal cortex in the absence of thalamic fibers, a transient requirement for a thalamic axon derived signal was observed postnatally. This property has interesting implications for the plasticity of cortical areas in development and evolution.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'Hyaluronan was partially depolymerized on a large-scale quantity using bacterial hyaluronidase (E.C. 4.2.2.1) for preparation of chemically fully O-sulfated oligosaccharides. The hyaluro-oligosaccharide (HAoligo) mixture obtained by partial digestion was repeatedly applied to low pressure gel permeation chromatographic separation to purify the size-unified oligosaccharide ranged from 4- to 20-mer. The purity and size of each HAoligo was confirmed by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis (CE) on normal polarity mode, and a newly established separation method by normal phase chromatography with Amide-80 column. The purified HAoligos ranged 4- to 20-mer were applied to chemically fully O-sulfation. Characterization of chemically fully O-sulfated HAoligos was performed by both chemical compositional analyses after hydrolysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. While the anti-factor IIa activity of 4- to 20-mer O-sulfated HAoligos was less than 3.1 units/mg, the inhibitory action for hyaluronidase (bovine testicular hyaluronidase (E.C.3.2.1.35)) of the oligosaccharides ranged 16- to 20-mer were corresponding to 79% of that shown by fully O-sulfated hyaluronan (MW 100 kDa) through both competitive and noncompetitive effects.'",2
"b'Area prostriata is a poorly understood cortical area located in the anterior portion of the calcarine sulcus. It has attracted interest as a separate visual area and progenitor for the cortex of this modality. In this report we describe a direct projection from area prostriata to the rostral cingulate motor cortex (M3) that forms the fundus and lower bank of the anterior part of the cingulate sulcus. Injections of retrograde tracers in M3 resulted in labeled neurons in layers III, V and VI of prostriate cortex. However, injections of anterograde tracers in M3 did not demonstrate axon terminals in area prostriata. This connection was organized topographically such that the rostral part of M3 received input from the dorsal region of prostriate cortex, whereas middle and caudal levels of M3 received input from more ventral locations. Injections of retrograde and anterograde tracers in the caudal cingulate motor cortex (M4) did not produce labeling in prostriate cortex. Cytoarchitectural analysis confirmed the identity of area prostriata and further clarified its extent and borders with the parasubiculum of the hippocampal formation rostrally, and V1 of the visual cortex caudally. This linkage between cortex bordering V1 and cortex giving rise to a component of the corticofacial and corticospinal pathways demonstrates a more direct visuomotor route than visual association projections coursing laterally.'",1
"b'The human MHC class Ib gene HLA-G is transcribed and translated in different placental cell subpopulations during pregnancy. In addition to this restricted tissue distribution, HLA-G proteins were also recently detected in the thymus of HLA-G transgenic mice, as well as in some human thymic epithelial cells (TEC). There was a need to further define the phenotype of the HLA-G-expressing cells in the human thymus as well as the type of translated forms that they produce. Using several HLA-G-specific mAb and immunohistochemistry performed on cryosections of human thymi at different ages, we found that the HLA-G-expressing cells are present on medullary cells exhibiting the epithelial morphological type 6. Co-localization experiments performed by double or triple immunofluorescence staining demonstrate that these HLA-G-expressing cells express various cytokeratins, epithelial cell markers but not the CD83 dendritic cell marker. We further show by ELISA measurements that a subset of primary cultured human TEC also expresses soluble HLA-G. Therefore, HLA-G protein tissue distribution is not restricted solely to placental cells. A subpopulation of medullary TEC also expresses HLA-G both at their cell surface and in secreted form, raising the question of the functional significance of such MHC class Ib molecules. Whether thymic soluble and/or membrane-bound HLA-G contribute to inhibit NK cells or to a negative selection of autoreactive T cells which could be harmful in case of pregnancy and/or to a positive selection of viral peptides/HLA-G-restricted CD8+ T cells remains to be demonstrated.'",4
"b'Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of chronic liver diseases but the degree to which these diseases contribute to liver-related mortality is not well established. The aim of this study was to estimate the absolute and relative effects of HCV infection on liver-related mortality.\r\n\r\nMethods A population random sample of 2472 subjects aged >=30 years was enrolled and followed up from 1985 to 1996. At enrolment, a structured interview and a clinical evaluation were performed. Serum samples were tested using HCV ELISA and RIBA HCV. Outcomes were overall and liver-related mortality and tracing procedures included review of office and hospital records, death certificates, and interviews with general practitioners, attending hospital and next of kin. Statistical analysis was performed using Poisson and binomial prospective data regression.\r\n\r\nResults Crude overall and liver-related mortality rates were 7.66 (95% CI : 6.68\x968.79) and 0.9 (95% CI : 0.3\x962.2) per 103 person-years, respectively. For HCV infection effect, incidence rate ratio and difference (per 103 person-year), risk ratio and difference were 27.5 (95% CI : 6.5\x96115.6), 4 (95% CI : 3\x967), 33.1 (95% CI : 7.8\x96 139.3) and 0.06 (95% CI : 0.04\x960.08), respectively; all measures were adjusted for age at death, sex and daily alcohol intake.\r\n\r\nConclusions The results show a strong relative but weak absolute effect of HCV infection on liver-related mortality in the 10-year period considered. Poisson and binomial models are virtually equivalent, but the choice of the summarizing measure of effect may have a different impact on health policy.'",3
"b'The common cytokine receptor {gamma} chain ({gamma}c) is an essential receptor component for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15, and thereby {gamma}c-deficient mice exhibit impaired T cell and B cell development. The Janus family tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) is known to be associated with {gamma}c, and the reported phenotypes of {gamma}c-deficient ({gamma}c\x96) and Jak3-deficient (Jak3\x96) mice are similar, indicating that Jak3 is an essential transducer of {gamma}c-dependent signals. Nevertheless, certain differences have been suggested related to the range of actions of {gamma}c and Jak3. To clarify whether {gamma}c-dependent cytokines can partially transduce their signals without Jak3, we compared lymphocyte development in {gamma}c\x96, Jak3\x96, and {gamma}c and Jak3 double-deficient ({gamma}c\x96Jak3\x96) mice in the same genetic background. With the exception that T and B cells in Jak3\x96 mice express high levels of {gamma}c, the defects in thymocyte and peripheral T cell and B cell development are indistinguishable among {gamma}c\x96, Jak3\x96 and {gamma}c\x96Jak3\x96 mice. Interestingly, although Bcl-2 induction was previously suggested to be Jak3-independent, IL-7 cannot induce Bcl-2 expression in CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes in either {gamma}c\x96 or Jak3\x96 mice nor can IL-7 rescue CD4 SP thymocytes from dexamethasone-induced cell death in {gamma}c\x96 or Jak3\x96 mice.

"b'n this study, the effects of ethanol and age on the morphology of the locus coeruleus (LC) and on the severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms were studied during a 5-week intermittent ethanol exposure. Young (3\x964 months) and old (29\x9630 months) male Wistar rats were given highly intoxicating doses of ethanol by intragastric intubations for 4 days, followed by a 3-day ethanol-withdrawal period. This 7-day cycle of ethanol exposure and withdrawal was repeated five times. A non-treated group and a sucrose-fed group of both ages were used as control groups. The severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms (rigidity, tremor, irritability, hypoactivity) was rated up to 62 h after the last dose of ethanol. The intoxication level was higher in the old, compared with the young, rats, despite the smaller doses of ethanol given to the old animals. There was no significant difference between the age groups in the severity of the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. The LC quantitative studies were performed using unbiased stereological methods. The results showed that there was no difference between the age groups in the LC total neuron numbers of the non-treated control groups. The 5-week intermittent ethanol exposure significantly reduced the LC neuron numbers and LC neuronal density in the old ethanol-exposed animals, compared with the sucrose-fed control animals. In the young rats, the ethanol-induced neuron loss did not reach statistical significance. According to the ANCOVA, the difference in the ethanol-induced LC neuronal loss between the age groups may be due to the difference in the intoxication levels. Interestingly, the sucrose intubations were also found to decrease the LC neuronal numbers in the young rats, compared with the non-treated young control group. It was concluded that ageing did not significantly affect the severity of ethanol-withdrawal symptoms or ethanol-induced loss of LC neurons in Wistar rats.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Most functional imaging studies of the auditory system have employed complex stimuli. We used positron emisssion tomography to map neural responses to 0.5 and 4.0 kHz sine-wave tones presented to the right ear at 30, 50, 70 and 90 dB HL and found activation in a complex neural network of elements traditionally associated with the auditory system as well as non-traditional sites such as the posterior cingulate cortex. Cingulate activity was maximal at low stimulus intensities, suggesting that it may function as a gain control center. In the right temporal lobe, the location of the maximal response varied with the intensity, but not with the frequency of the stimuli. In the left temporal lobe, there was evidence for tonotopic organization: a site lateral to the left primary auditory cortex was activated equally by both tones while a second site in primary auditory cortex was more responsive to the higher frequency. Infratentorial activations were contralateral to the stimulated ear and included the lateral cerebellum, the lateral pontine tegmentum, the midbrain and the medial geniculate. Contrary to predictions based on cochlear membrane mechanics, at each intensity, 4.0 kHz stimuli were more potent activators of the brain than the 0.5 kHz stimuli.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Multiple (10x) treatment of zolpidem (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg, orally, p.o.) led to different effects in chronically ethanol-treated and control rats. In control rats, after repeated zolpidem administration, a weaker, when compared to single administration, hypnotic effect of ethanol was observed, which may be the result of tolerance developed towards the inhibitory effect of zolpidem. However, in chronically ethanol-treated rats, the multiple zolpidem treatment led to prolongation of ethanol-induced sleep similar to the values observed in non-zolpidem-treated control animals. This suggests that zolpidem multiple administration may inhibit tolerance towards ethanol in chronically ethanol-treated rats. In the experiment with zolpidem, there were effects on performance in a memory test and the impairment of passive avoidance task after multiple drug treatment when compared to the effects after single administration in control rats. In contrast, in chronically ethanol-treated rats, amplification of latency (especially after 2.0 mg/kg) was observed. The possible relationship between ethanol-induced sedation and latency values would be consistent with a higher contribution of the inhibitory effect of zolpidem, than a direct influence on memory processes in chronically ethanol-treated rats.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Soluble recombinant (r) P-selectin and rP-selectin immobilized on plastic surfaces were tested for their capacity to activate neutrophils to produce superoxide anion. Soluble rP-selectin was incapable of activating leukocytes, whereas immobilized rP-selectin was able to induce leukocyte activation. When neutrophils were pretreated with a low dose of IL-8, granulocyte colony stimulating factor or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, soluble rP-selectin was no longer inert. These cytokine-primed leukocytes produced superoxide anion in the presence of soluble rP-selectin. During this priming period, sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) epitopes redistributed to one end of the leukocytes. Similar polarization of sLeX epitopes was observed at the attachment site of cells that adhered to immobilized rP-selectin. Cap formation and superoxide anion production induced by solid-phase P-selectin or by IL-8 and soluble rP-selectin treatment were inhibited by treatment of the leukocytes with cytochalasin B. These observations suggest that the redistribution of the carbohydrate ligands and the polarization of the leukocyte surface through an active process is a prerequisite but not sufficient to leukocyte superoxide production through P-selectin.'",4
"b'The trafficking of T lymphocytes is carefully regulated by adhesive interactions with the vascular endothelium. Depending on their maturation and activation stage, T lymphocytes exhibit distinctive patterns of homing and recirculation, which is at least partly due to the selective expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) on the T cell surface. In order to define whether the differential usage of CAM during the steps of transendothelial migration is involved in organ-specific recirculation of different T cell subsets we compared the interaction of three different T cell populations with mouse endothelioma cell lines in vitro. Using a novel approach, where we directly compared T cell interaction with ICAM-1-deficient endothelium to wild-type endothelium, we recently demonstrated that endothelial ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 play a key role in mediating the transendothelial migration of CD4+ memory T cells. Here we show that endothelial ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 are equally required for the transendothelial migration of other T cell populations such as thymocytes and T lymphoma cells, which differ from CD4+ memory T cells in their maturation and activation stage, as well as in their surface expression of adhesion molecules. Our data therefore demonstrate that transendothelial migration of different T cell populations is mediated by the same endothelial CAM, i.e. ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, and thus subset-specific interaction of T cells with endothelial cells must be regulated prior to transendothelial migration.'",4
"b'The granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter contains a 10 bp element known as CK-1 or CD28RE that specifically responds to the co-stimulatory signal delivered to T cells via the CD28 surface receptor. This element is a variant NF{kappa}B site that does not function alone but requires an adjacent promoter region that includes a classical NF{kappa}B element, an Sp-1 site and a putative activator protein-1 (AP-1)-like binding site. The entire region is referred to as the CD28 response region (CD28RR). The GM-CSF CK-1 element has been shown to bind NF{kappa}B proteins, in particular c-Rel, whose binding and function is dependent on the architectural transcription factor HMGI(Y). It has been previously suggested that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of proteins also plays a role in the activity of this region. We show here that recombinant NFATp but not AP-1 can bind to the GM-CSF CD28RR. NFATp present in activated Jurkat T cell extracts can also interact with the CD28RR. The binding of NFATp and Rel proteins requires the same core CK-1 sequences, and appears to be mutually exclusive. We investigated the functional significance of NFATp binding to CK-1 by overexpressing the protein in Jurkat T cells and found that NFATp cannot activate the CD28RR alone but can cooperate with signals generated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/calcium ionophore. The CD28RR is therefore a complex region that can bind and respond to a combination of transcription factors and signals.'",4
"b'Rel, a haemopoietic cell-restricted member of the NF-{kappa}B/Rel family of transcription factors, has recently been shown to be important in the function of B and T lymphocytes. In an attempt to understand the role of this protein in the immune response, we examined the ability of Rel\x96/\x96 mice to counter an influenza virus infection. Normal levels of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells induced in Rel\x96/\x96 mice were able to clear virus from the lungs, albeit with somewhat delayed kinetics compared to normal mice. Rel\x96/\x96 mice did, however, display a markedly reduced T cell proliferative response to the virus, and exhibited impaired local and systemic influenza virus-specific antibody responses. This defect was sufficient to result in an inability of vaccinated mice, but not of previously infected mice, to acquire antibody-dependent protective immunity to reinfection with the same virus. These findings establish that during the response to influenza virus, Rel function allows optimal development of humoral immunity, a role that apparently cannot be fulfilled by other NF-{kappa}B/Rel proteins.'",4
"b""This paper proposes a method for the quantitative characterization of repertoire diversity of an unknown mixture of antibodies on the basis of its reactivity profile in the quantitative immunoblot (QIB). The QIB is calibrated by measuring the reactivity profiles of supernatants of known `diversity' (i.e. known numbers of B cell clones). We define a quantitative `index of variability' (IV) which decreases regularly as the diversity increases and the profiles tend towards a common `convergence profile'. The calibration procedure is consolidated by a mathematical model based on the Poisson distribution; this theoretical model accounts correctly for the observed convergence behavior. On the basis of this calibration curve, it is possible to estimate the diversity of an unknown antibody mixture from a measure of its IV. We conclude that the functional diversity of natural serum IgM in mice can be estimated at ~16,000 clones.""",4
"b'Cells in the dorsal medial superior temporal cortex (MSTd) process optic flow generated by self-motion during visually guided navigation. A neural model shows how interactions between well-known neural mechanisms (log polar cortical magnification, Gaussian motion-sensitive receptive fields, spatial pooling of motion-sensitive signals and subtractive extraretinal eye movement signals) lead to emergent properties that quantitatively simulate neurophysiological data about MSTd cell properties and psychophysical data about human navigation. Model cells match MSTd neuron responses to optic flow stimuli placed in different parts of the visual field, including position invariance, tuning curves, preferred spiral directions, direction reversals, average response curves and preferred locations for stimulus motion centers. The model shows how the preferred motion direction of the most active MSTd cells can explain human judgments of self-motion direction (heading), without using complex heading templates. The model explains when extraretinal eye movement signals are needed for accurate heading perception, and when retinal input is sufficient, and how heading judgments depend on scene layouts and rotation rates.'",1
"b'F5 TCR transgenic mice challenged in vivo with peptide generate long-lived primed CD8 T cells that hyper-proliferate in response to peptide in vitro. These primed CD8 T cells can be subdivided into three distinct populations on the basis of CD44 cell surface expression. In this report, we show that among primed CD8 T cells, those expressing intermediate levels of CD44 appear to be true memory T cells by the measurement of a variety of characteristics. Indeed, these cells hyper-proliferate in response to peptide re-stimulation in vitro, and produce IFN-{gamma} with faster kinetics and at higher levels than naive populations in vitro. We also show that CD8 T cells expressing high levels of CD44 express several activation markers and cycle in vivo in the absence of antigen. However, this population is unable to respond to peptide stimulation in vitro as measured by both proliferation and IFN-{gamma} secretion. The origin and specificity of these cells is unknown. These results provide evidence that memory CD8 T cells are functionally different from naive CD8 T cells both in terms of proliferation and cytokine secretion. They identify the CD8/CD44int T cells as the population responsible for hyper-reactivity in vitro.'",4
"b'The past 100 years witnessed the formation of a disease concept of alcoholism and a rapid increase in the knowledge of its aetiopathology and treatment options. In the first half of the century, public sanctions aimed at the abolition of alcoholism. In the United States, alcohol prohibition was revoked in the economic turmoil of the Great Depression. In Germany, proposed medical procedures to reduce the fertility of alcoholics had catastrophic consequences during the fascist dictatorship. A revived focus on alcoholics as patients with a right to medical treatment came out of self-organized groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The current disease concept includes the psychosocial and neurobiological foundations and consequences of alcoholism. Neurobiological research points to the dispositional factor of monoaminergic dysfunction and indicates that neuroadaptation and sensitization may play a role in the maintenance of addictive behaviour. New treatment options include pharmacological approaches and indicate that behaviour and motivational therapy and the attendance of patient groups may equally reduce the relapse risk. The task of the future will be to apply scientific discoveries in the best interest of the patients and to support their efforts to be respected like subjects suffering from other diseases.'",0
"b'The self-rating of drinking habits was compared to DSM-III-R diagnoses of alcohol abuse and dependence in 181 men with an average age (\xb1 SD) of 38.7 \xb1 1.91 years. Results indicate that the 150 subjects without alcohol-related diagnosis (Group 1) rated themselves as \x91non-problem drinker\x92, in categories from \x91non-drinker\x92 to \x91heavy drinker\x92. Among the 15 individuals with alcohol abuse (Group 2), none rated their drinking pattern as \x91problem drinker\x92. Two (12.5%) subjects in the group of 16 individuals with alcohol dependence (Group 3) rated themselves as \x91problem drinker\x92, while most did not consider their drinking patterns as problematic. Within subjects who identified themselves as the same type of drinker (e.g. \x91infrequent drinker\x92, \x91moderate drinker\x92, etc ...), the quantity, frequency, and number of alcohol-related problems were higher in Groups 2 and 3, compared to Group 1. The self-rating of drinking habits using a single question failed to identify over 90% of the subjects diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (100% of those with alcohol abuse and 87.5% of those with alcohol dependence), and did not differentiate between levels of alcohol intake and number of alcohol-related problems for subjects who identified as a particular drinking type.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs (PTD) has been reported to have increased in alcoholics, but previous studies report conflicting results concerning the rate of increase and clinical characteristics. The aim of the present study was first, to assess the dependence rate of PTD among alcoholics in open and institutionalized care, and to compare these populations with the general population, and second, to assess rates and doses of high- and low-dose PTD-dependence among alcoholics. Methods: In 1997, alcoholics in open and institutionalized care were asked to anonymously fill in a questionnaire on their drug use and dependence. Healthy controls were included. The number of attending subjects was 130 open-care alcoholics at the Department of Alcohol and Drug Diseases in Malm\xf6, Sweden; 23 alcoholics in institutionalized care at Karlsvik Rehabilitation Centre in H\xf6\xf6r, Sweden; and 120 healthy controls at V\xe5rdcentralen Kirseberg, a primary health care centre located in a Malm\xf6 area. The approximate attendance rate was 75, 70 and 95%, respectively. The questionnaire was based on DSM-IV criteria for dependence. Results: The total rate of PTD-dependent alcoholics was higher in the institutionalized group (35%) than in the open-care setting (14%): difference in proportions (p1\x96p2 21%; 95% CI: 1%, 41%). Alcoholics were more often PTD-dependent (17%) than were healthy controls (2%), (p1\x96p2 15%; 95% CI: 9%, 21%). Benzodiazepines (BZD) were the most common PTD. Only four out of a total of 23 BZD-dependent alcoholics developed high-dose BZD-dependence. Those subjects were also misusing other drugs, including cannabis. Conclusions: We conclude that alcoholism is associated with legal PTD-dependence and illegal drug misuse. High-dose BZD-dependence is infrequent among BZD-dependent alcoholics.'",0
"b'Among the sponges (Porifera), the oldest group of metazoans in phylogenetic terms, the Hexactinellida is considered to have diverged earliest from the two other sponge classes, the Demospongiae and Calcarea. The Hexactinellida are unusual among all Metazoa in possessing mostly syncytial rather than cellular tissues. Here we describe the purification of a cell adhesion molecule with a size of 34 kDa (in its native form; 24 kDa after deglycosylation) from the hexactinellid sponge Aphrocallistes vastus. This adhesion molecule was previously found to agglutinate preserved cells and membranes in a non\x96species-specific manner (M\xfcller, W. E. G., Zahn, R. K, Conrad, J., Kurelec, B., and Uhlenbruck, G. [1984] Cell adhesion molecules in the haxactinellid Aphrocallistes vastus: species-unspecific aggregationfactor. Differentiation, 26, 30\x9635). The fact that the aggregation process required Ca2+ and was inhibited by bird\x92s nest glycoprotein and D-galactose but not by D-mannose or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine suggests that this cell adhesion molecule is a C-type lectin. To test this assumption, two highly similar C-type lectins were cloned from A.vastus. The deduced polypeptides of the two cDNA species isolated classified these molecules as C-type lectins. The calculated Mr of the 191 aa long sequences were 22,022 and 22,064, respectively. The C-type lectins showed highest similarity to C-type lectins (type-II membrane proteins) from higher metazoan phyla; these molecules are absent in non-Metazoa. The two sponge C-type lectins contain the conserved domains known from other C-type lectins (e.g., disulfide bonds, the amino acids known to be involved in Ca2+-binding, as well as the amino acids involved in the specificity of binding to D-galactose) and a hydrophobic N-terminal region. The N-terminal part of the purified C-type lectin was identical with the corresponding region of the deduced polypeptide from the cDNA. It is proposed that the A.vastus lectins might bind to the cell membrane by their hydrophobic segment and might interact with carbohydrate units on the surface of the other cells/syncytia.'",2
"b'Glucosidase I initiates the processing of asparagine (N-) linked glycoproteins by removing the distal [alpha]1,2-linked glucosyl residue of the tetradecasaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. The gene encoding this enzyme was isolated and its structural organization and promoter activity determined. The major transcript for glucosidase I on northern blot appeared to be 3.1 kb; Southern blotting and DNA sequencing indicated the size of the gene to be 6.8 kb, comprising four exons separated by three introns. The first exon encodes the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain; the fourth encodes the putative catalytic domain of the enzyme. Exon-intron junctions are flanked by consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. Transcription initiation sites were mapped by primer extension, ribonuclease protection assay and RT-PCR analysis. Primer extension results showed multiple initiation sites at -150, -156, and -272 bp relative to the translation initiation codon ATG. Sequence analysis of 5[prime] flanking region showed no canonical TATA box, a high GC content, Sp1 and ETF binding sites (typical of a housekeeping gene promoter). Also noteworthy, the promoter region contains several generic STAT factor binding sites, one nearly perfect, and two half GR binding elements. Other cis-acting elements recognized by transcription factors such as AP-2, NF-[kappa]B, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor (PR) were also present in the putative promoter region. To determine the promoter activity, a construct encompassing the region between -2114 to -5 bp of the putative promoter was ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into COS 7 cells. CAT assay results clearly show transcriptional activity of the promoter.'",2
"b'Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a spectrum of liver diseases and a proportion of chronic cases progress through cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The viral and host factors that are important in the clinical and histological progression of HCV infection are unclear. We investigated the effect of moderate (<80 g/day) and heavy (>80 g/day) alcohol intake on the histological and clinical progression of HCV infection and their associated risk of hepatic cancer in a group of Japanese patients. A number of other variables were assessed to evaluate their impact on disease progression. We recruited 120 patients with HCV infection and categorized them into four groups, based on alcohol consumption pattern. All clinical and biochemical profiles were collected from recorded files. Liver biopsies were analysed for the degree of fibrosis, presence of cirrhosis and histological activity of necroinflammation. Hepatic tumours were detected by the follow-up imaging analysis. There was no difference in the age, length of exposure to HCV infection and HCV RNA serum levels in the alcohol and alcohol-free groups. The histological grading of necroinflammation, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and HCV RNA did not have any correlation with each other in the alcohol and alcohol-free group. There was a 1.5\x962.5-fold greater risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the alcohol intake group compared to the alcohol-free group. Kruskal\x96Wallis analysis among four groups demonstrated a significant transition to fibrosis (P < 0.05) for alcoholics with HCV infection. The increased risk of liver cancer in the alcohol group is independent of size and growth of tumours. The clinical manifestations of gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and encephalopathy were also higher in the alcohol intake group. Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor in the histological and clinical progression of HCV infection and has no relation with HCV replication. Chronic HCV carriers should avoid excessive alcohol intake to reduce the acceleration of liver disease and risk of liver cancer.'",0
"b'To elucidate the functions of nonprimary motor cortical (nPMC) areas whose afferents synapse onto output neurons of the primary motor cortex (PMC), we examined the responses of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) and non-PTNs (nPTNs) to electrical stimulation in the three nPMCs, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), with extracellular unit recording in alert monkeys. Typical responses of PTNs to nPMC stimulation were early orthodromic excitatory responses followed by inhibitory responses. Among 27 PTNs tested by constructing peri-stimulus time histograms, 19 (70.4%) showed inhibitory responses to stimulation in all of the nPMC areas. In contrast, 5/33 PTNs (15.2%) and 10/72 nPTNs (13.9%) showed excitatory responses to stimulation in all of the nPMCs. The inhibitory responses of PTNs were mediated by inhibitory interneurons, some of which may correspond to nPTNs in the superficial layers of the PMC. These interneurons probably possess widely extended axons and nonspecifically inhibit multiple PTNs in layer V. The excitatory and inhibitory influences, and the patterns of convergence of inputs from the nPMCs onto the PTNs, are important to understand motor control by the nPMC\x96PMC\x96spinal cord pathway.'",1
"b'The effects of carnosine and related compounds on erythrocytes from alcoholics were studied. In their presence, erythrocytes showed an increased ability to resist haemolysis and showed a more normal morphology, with carnosine and N-acetyl-carnosine being the most effective compounds.

"b'Duration of abstinence before blood test, alcohol consumption and age was examined in 177 male alcohol-dependent patients as factors influencing serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), serum {gamma}-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The strongest influence on all markers was the factor \x91duration of abstinence before blood test\x92. In patients who had been abstinent for >4 days before the blood test, the markers had low sensitivities (GGT, 33%; CDT, 14%; MCV, 42%), whereas in patients with <= 4 days of abstinence the markers had reasonably good sensitivities (GGT, 72%; CDT, 56%; MCV, 48%). GGT was more sensitive than CDT (P < 0.05) and MCV (P < 0.001). The combined use of CDT and GGT had sensitivity of over 90%. Mean alcohol consumption in the 30 days prior to the blood test had a significant effect on CDT and GGT, but not on MCV. Age did not have a clear effect on CDT and GGT. For MCV, a significant and linear increase with age was shown. We conclude that GGT is the most sensitive of these three markers. Using GGT and CDT combined, sensitivity can be enhanced to over 90%. The period of abstinence before the blood test has a strong influence on CDT and GGT. If a longer period of abstinence is suspected, MCV should also be measured, in order to detect evidence of earlier heavy drinking.'",0
"b'Two soluble [alpha]-mannosidases, E-I and E-II, were purified from C.albicans yeast cells by a three-step procedure consisting of size exclusion and ion exchange chromatographies in Sepharose CL6B and Mono Q columns, respectively, and preparative nondenaturing electrophoresis. E-I and E-II migrated as monomeric polypeptides of 54.3 and 93.3 kDa in SDS-PAGE, respectively. Some biochemical properties of purified enzymes were investigated by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside as substrates. Hydrolysis of both substrates by either enzyme was optimum at pH 6.0 with 50 mM Mes-Tris buffer and at 42\xb0C. Apparent Km values for hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside by E-I were 0.83 \xb5M and 2.4 mM, respectively. Corresponding values for E-II were 0.25 \xb5M and 1.86 mM. Swansonine and deoxymannojirimicin strongly inhibited the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside by both enzymes. On the contrary, hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-[alpha]-D-mannopyranoside by E-I and E-II was slightly stimulated or not affected, respectively, by both inhibitors. E-I and E-II did not depend on metal ions although activity of the latter was slightly stimulated by Mn2+ and Ca2+ in the range of 0.5-2 mM. At the same concentrations, Mg2+ was slightly inhibitory of both enzymes. Substrate specificity experiments revealed that both E-I and E-II preferentially cleaved [alpha]-1,6 and [alpha]-1,3 linkages, respectively.'",2
"b'This paper proposes an evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of (i) the inside-out pattern of mammalian corticogenesis in which late-generated cells become located more superficially than earlygenerated cells, and (ii) the predominantly radial organization of isocortical inputs in mammals. It is suggested that an outside-in neurogenetic gradient (in which early-generated cells are located more superficially than late-generated cells), as occurs in reptilian cortex, would have positioned the late-produced, associative neurons (destined to supragranular layers in modern isocortex) below the early-produced output neurons. This may have limited the possibilities of synaptic contacts between the younger cells and the afferent terminals which were located in the more superficial layer I. There was probably an adaptive benefit in those individuals in which late-produced cells were capable of passing through the layers of already migrated cells, thus making contacts with superficial afferents and generating corticocortical and local circuits that processed the information before producing an output. Reelin, an extracellular glycoprotein found in layer I, and a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5) and its neuronal-specific activator (p35) may have played key roles in the generation of the inside-out gradient. Additionally, by serving as a waiting compartment for thalamic axons while the cortical plate develops, the subplate zone may have participated in the change from an emphasis in a tangential arrangement of thalamic terminals that is characteristic of reptilian cortex to the predominantly radial mode of termination that is observed in mammalian isocortex.'",1
"b'he TCR-associated protein CD3{zeta} plays a major role in regulating the state of responsiveness to peptide\x96MHC complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In this paper the requirement of CD3{zeta} in the generation of cytotoxic T cells was compared with its requirement in cytokine gene activation in two mutant mice: ZKO mice with a disrupted CD3{zeta} gene and ZTG mice in which a truncated CD3{zeta} segment was expressed as a transgene on the ZKO background. Upon infection of ZTG mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were detected, identical to responses in wild-type mice. In addition, antigen-specific CTL responses to allogeneic class I and class II MHC in ZTG animals were indistinguishable from those in wild-type animals. However, CTL responses to the same major antigens were not detectable in ZKO mice. We conclude that the signal transduction pathways leading to CTL development and cytokine production can be triggered through TCR in the absence of functional CD3{zeta}, provided the remainder of the TCR\x96CD3 complex is expressed at high levels on the cell surface. Surprisingly, IFN-{gamma} production in response to LCMV followed the same kinetics in ZKO, ZTG and wild-type mice. However, in vitro studies showed that cytokine production in general was abnormally regulated in T lymphocytes from ZKO mice, in contrast to ZTG T cells. Taken together, these studies support the hypothesis that development of CTL can take place in the absence of functional CD3{zeta}. However, CTL development requires stronger TCR-initiated signal transduction events than induction of cytokine genes.'",4
"b""Eight different CD40 mAb shared with soluble trimeric CD40 ligand (sCD40LT) the capacity to rescue germinal center (GC) B cells from spontaneous apoptosis and to suppress antigen receptor-driven apoptosis in group I Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Three mAb (G28-5, M2 and M3) mimicked sCD40LT in its ability to promote strong homotypic adhesion in resting B cells, whereas others (EA5, BL-OGY/C4 and 5C3) failed to stimulate strong clustering. Binding studies revealed that only those mAb that promoted strong B cell clustering bound at, or near to, the CD40L binding site. While all eight mAb and sCD40LT were capable of synergizing with IL-4 or phorbol ester for promoting DNA synthesis in resting B cells, co-stimulus-independent activation of the cells into cycle through CD40 related directly to the extent of receptor cross-linking. Thus, mAb which bound outside the CD40L binding site synergized with sCD40LT for promoting DNA synthesis; maximal levels of stimulation were achieved by presenting any of the mAb on CD32 transfectants in the absence of sCD40LT or by cross-linking bound sCD40LT with a second antibody. Monomeric sCD40L, which was able to promote rescue of GC B cells from apoptosis, was unable to drive resting B cells into cycle. These studies demonstrate that CD40-dependent rescue of human B cells from apoptosis requires minimal cross-linking and is essentially epitope independent, whereas the requirements for promoting cell cycle progression and homotypic adhesion are more stringent. Possible mechanisms underlying these differences and their physiological significance are discussed.""",4
"b'Analyzing the induction kinetics and promoter elements regulating the expression of the transcription factor Egr-1, we found elevated levels of Egr-1-encoding mRNA in synovial fibroblasts of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients when compared to controls. By contrast, synovial lymphocytes and macrophages do not show an elevated Egr-1 transcription. Therefore, the overexpression of Egr-1 may serve as a diagnostic marker to characterize synovial fibroblasts of RA patients. To study the regulatory mechanisms controlling Egr-1 expression we analyzed the function of transcription factor binding sites located in the Egr-1 promoter. Individual transcription factor binding sites within the Egr-1 promoter were specifically mutated and Egr-1 promoter activity was tested using reporter gene constructs. Our experiments demonstrate that serum response elements are the main positive regulators and binding to a cAMP responsive element represents the major negative regulator for Egr-1 expression in synovial fibroblasts. In addition, we functionally defined a new element, which was not yet described in the human Egr-1 promoter and which serves as a second negative regulatory element for Egr-1 expression. Therefore increased serum response factor activity or failure of Egr-1 repressing signals may account for Egr-1 overexpression in RA synovial fibroblasts.'",4
"b'Sialidases are present on the surface of several trypanosomatid protozoan parasites. They are highly specific for sialic acid linked in {alpha}-(2,3) to a terminal \xdf-galactose and include the strictly hydrolytic enzymes and trans-sialidases (sialyl-transferases). Based on the structural comparison of the sialidase from Trypanosoma rangeli and the trans-sialidase from T. cruzi (the agent of Chagas\x92 disease in humans), we have explored the role of specific amino acid residues sought to be important for substrate specificity. The substitution of a conserved tryptophanyl residue in the two enzymes, Trp312/313-Ala, changed substrate specificity, rendering the point mutants capable to hydrolyze both {alpha}-(2,3)- and {alpha}-(2,6)-linked sialoconjugates. The same mutation abolished sialyl-transferase activity, indicating that transfer (but not hydrolysis) requires a precise orientation of the bound substrate. The exchange substitution of another residue that modulates oligosaccharide binding, Gln284-Pro, was found to significantly increase the hydrolytic activity of sialidase, and residue Tyr119 was confirmed to be part of a second binding site for the acceptor substrate in trans-sialidase. Together with the structural information, these results provide a consistent framework to account for the unique enzymatic properties of trypanosome trans-sialidases.'",2
"b""Functional organization of the lateral temporal cortex in humans is not well understood. We recorded blood oxygenation signals from the temporal lobes of normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation with unstructured noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, reversed speech, pseudowords and words. For all conditions, subjects performed a material- nonspecific detection response when a train of stimuli began or ceased. Dorsal areas surrounding Heschl's gyrus bilaterally, particularly the planum temporale and dorsolateral superior temporal gyrus, were more strongly activated by FM tones than by noise, suggesting a role in processing simple temporally encoded auditory information. Distinct from these dorsolateral areas, regions centered in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally were more activated by speech stimuli than by FM tones. Identical results were obtained in this region using words, pseudowords and reversed speech, suggesting that the speech\x96tones activation difference is due to acoustic rather than linguistic factors. In contrast, previous comparisons between word and nonword speech sounds showed left-lateralized activation differences in more ventral temporal and temporoparietal regions that are likely involved in processing lexical\x96semantic or syntactic information associated with words. The results indicate functional subdivision of the human lateral temporal cortex and provide a preliminary framework for understanding the cortical processing of speech sounds.""",1
"b'In recently intoxicated non-cirrhotic male alcohol-misusing and -dependent patients, we studied, during early withdrawal and more prolonged abstinence, the rate of changes of sex hormones and their binding globulin (SHBG), the prevalence of hypo-androgenism and possible determinant factors of SHBG increase. Twenty-one alcoholics and 21 controls were studied. SHBG plasma levels, sex hormones (SH), cortisol, insulin and thyroid hormones were measured at admission and discharge. SHBG and SH were also determined on days 2, 4 and 7 after admission and on weeks 2, 6 and 12 after discharge. SHBG showed a 3-fold increase, decreasing slowly during the first 10 days, but remaining above control values. Luteinizing hormone was also increased. Free testosterone (Tf) was low at admission and correlated negatively with SHBG during the first 10 days. By day 10, Tf reached normal values, despite SHBG remaining elevated. The other sex hormones were normal. Neither insulin nor thyroid hormones correlated with SHBG. Cortisol was high at admission and then normalized. Clinical hypo-androgenism was found in 33\x9650% of patients, but did not correlate with SHBG or SH. During follow-up, nine patients relapsed. In those remaining abstinent, SHBG continued decreasing, reaching normal levels in the 12th week. In those who relapsed, SHBG remained high or even increased further. Gamma-glutamyltransferase showed similar but faster changes. We conclude that excessive alcohol ingestion is associated with marked increases of SHBG which slowly revert during abstinence. High SHBG does not fully explain the low Tf values or the presence of clinical hypo-androgenism in alcoholics. This SHBG response to ethanol makes it a potential marker of excessive alcohol intake.'",0
"b'CD40 and HLA-DR molecules are two major components of the immune system, and their engagement on several cell types leads to various cellular events that modulate cell function. In this study, we demonstrate that signaling via these molecules leads to a rapid B cell death. CD40-mediated cell death was mainly observed in Epstein\x96Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell lines, whereas, HLA-DR-induced response can be triggered in normal activated B cells as well as in EBV-transformed B cell lines. Cell death induced via both molecules does not require de novo protein synthesis, but involves the integrity of the cytoskeleton. The sensitivity of CD40- and HLA-DR-mediated cell death to various inhibitors is very similar to that previously reported for tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)- and Fas-triggered apoptosis; however, caspases leading to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage are not implicated in this response. Both B cell death forms do not involve Fas\x96Fas ligand and TNF\x96TNFR systems, but require LFA-1-independent cell\x96cell interactions mediated by still undefined molecules. Although CD40- and HLA-DR-mediated cell death appears to follow a common pathway, inhibitors of poly- and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity differentially affect these responses. Defining the molecules involved in CD40- and HLA-DR-mediated death will provide a possible interrelation between the different B cell death programs that can lead to a better comprehension of regulation of B cell functions.'",4
"b'During an intervention period of 1 to 2 months, a project team supported general practitioners (GPs) and nurses in four primary health care centres in Sweden in introducing new routines for detection and treatment of problem drinkers. After the implementation of the new methods, the GPs reported increased involvement in early detection and intervention significantly more often than the nurses did. A majority in both groups reported perceived improvement in skills. There was a significant positive change of the attitudes concerning working with alcohol-related problems in the nurses reaching the same level as the GPs. In the nurses, attitudes and self-perceived intervention skills were improved, but to a lesser extent than their practice. The results indicate that future efforts concerning improvement of primary health care staff involvement in alcohol interventions should focus on training, supervision, and giving positive examples, rather than on changing an already positive attitude towards alcohol intervention. The potential role of nurses is still uncertain and not utilized sufficiently.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'It has been hypothesized that language functions are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere in males than in females. Previous anatomical data and patient studies have suggested that the posterior language areas should exhibit sex differences. However, neuroimaging studies to date have only provided support for differences in the anterior language areas. To look for differences in the posterior language areas, functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained while male and female subjects listened attentively to a story read aloud and to the same story replayed in reverse. Comparing activation in the superior and the middle temporal gyri during a story to activation during reverse replay of the story showed lateralization to the left in males but not in females. There was no lateralization in either sex when comparing activation during random fragmentation of the story to reverse replay. In the angular and the supramarginal gyri, however, activation was lateralized to the left hemisphere in both sexes, unlike the sex-dependent activation of the posterior temporal lobes. We infer that females use the posterior temporal lobes more bilaterally during linguistic processing of global structures in a narrative than males do.\r\n\r\n'",1

Though the common mushroom exclusively contained N-glycans of the oligomannosidic type, all plant foods contained mixtures of the above-mentioned types. Apple, asparagus, avocado, banana, carrot, celery, hazelnut, kiwi, onion, orange, pear, pignoli, strawberry, and walnut were particularly rich in Lea-carrying N-glycans. Although traces of Lea-containing structures were also present in almond, pistachio, potato, and tomato, no such glycans could be found in cauliflower. Coconut exhibited almost exclusively N-glycans containing only xylose but no fucose. Oligomannosidic N-glycans dominated in buckwheat and especially in the legume seeds mung bean, pea, peanut, and soybean. Papaya presented a unique set of hybrid type structures partially containing the Lea determinant.\r\n\r\nThese results are not only compatible with the hypothesis that the carbohydrate structures are another potential source of immunological cross-reaction between different plant allergens, but they also demonstrate that the Lea-type structure is very widespread among plants.'",2
"b'Glucosidase II is a processing enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that functions to hydrolyze two glucose residues in immature N-linked oligosaccharides attached to newly synthesized polypeptides. We previously reported the cDNA cloning of the [alpha]- and [beta]-subunits of mouse glucosidase II from T cells following copurification of these proteins with the highly glycosylated transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45. Subsequent examination of additional cDNA clones, coupled with partial genomic DNA sequencing, has revealed that both subunits are encoded by gene products that undergo alternative splicing in T lymphocytes. The catalytic [alpha]-subunit possesses two variably expressed segments, box [Agr]1, consisting of 22 amino acids located proximal to the amino-terminus, and box [Agr]2, composed of 9 amino acids situated between the amino-terminus and the putative catalytic site in the central region of the molecule. Box [Bgr]1, a variably expressed 7 amino acid segment in the [beta]-subunit of glucosidase II, is located immediately downstream of an acidic stretch near the carboxyl-terminus. Screening of reverse transcribed RNA by polymerase chain reaction confirms the variable inclusion of each of these segments in transcripts obtained from a panel of T-lymphocyte cell lines. Thus, distinct isoforms of glucosidase II exist that may perform specialized functions.'",2
"b'Although many studies have explored the effects of acute or chronic ethanol exposure during the postimplantation period on embryo/fetal development, few reports have described the ethanol effects on preimplantation embryo development. Little is known about the effects of ethanol consumption prior to gestation on embryo growth. Recently, we have shown that chronic moderate ethanol intake by prepubertal female mice reduces the ovulatory response and impairs in vitro fertilization and in vitro embryo preimplantation development. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effects of preconceptional chronic moderate ethanol ingestion on preimplantation embryo morphology and differentiation, the timing of cleavage and embryo growth in vivo, and to determine the time pattern in which alterations appear. Prepubertal female mice were treated with 10% (w/v) ethanol for 30 days prior to conception. After inducing ovulation on day 27 and 29 of the ethanol treatment, females were mated with control males and the day of presence of vaginal plug was day 1. On day 1, a decreased percentage of normal fertilized oocytes, elevated parthenogenetic oocyte activation and unfertilized eggs with abnormal metaphase II were found in ethanol-treated, compared to control females. On day 2, while any differences in the total percentage of 2-cell embryos were observed, the treated females had a significantly higher percentage of morphologically abnormal embryos, compared to control females. On day 3, the preconceptional consumption of ethanol produced significantly reduced percentages of compacted morulae and an increased percentage of uncompacted morulae. The total percentage of morulae in the treated females was lower than in controls. On day 4, ethanol-treated females showed significantly decreased percentages of hatched attached blastocysts and increased early blastocyst and morula percentages, compared to controls. Thus, preconceptional chronic moderate ethanol ingestion by prepubertal female mice produced retarded development, impaired blastocyst hatching, abnormal embryo morphology and embryo loss by fragmentation due to alterations induced in the female gamete.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""Background The poor health status of Australia's indigenous population is reflected in relatively high mortality rates from almost all causes, including preventable causes such as cervical cancer, where the rate is six to eight times that of non-Aboriginal women. However, there is little information on the geographical distribution of risk, an important issue for service deployment. This study examined the risk of death from cervical cancer in relation to Indigenous status, age and rurality.\r\n\r\nMethods Data from death registers from Australian states and territories who have identified Aboriginal people were examined for 1986\x961997 to obtain a list of all deaths where the primary cause was cancer of the cervix. The data categorized females by 5-year age group, by metropolitan, rural or remote category and by Indigenous status. Mean age at death and standardized mortality ratios for deaths from cervical cancer were calculated for Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal women in metropolitan, rural and remote areas.\r\n\r\nResults The risk of death from cervical cancer for Aboriginal women compared with non-Aboriginal women increased by 4.3-fold for metropolitan areas, 9.7-fold for rural areas and 18.3-fold for remote areas.\r\n\r\nConclusions Aboriginal women in rural and remote areas of Australia are at significantly higher risk of death from cancer of the cervix than either Aboriginal women in metropolitan areas or non-Aboriginal women in any area. This result raises questions about access to services for prevention and early diagnosis and other factors that might impact on the incidence and natural history of the disease.""",3
"b'The number of microbes associated with our gut likely exceeds our total number of somatic and germ cells. Despite their numbers, almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine whether the interaction between a microbial species and its host will be beneficial. Recent results obtained from in vivo models have revealed critical roles for glycoconjugates in helping define the outcome of two such host\x96microbial relationships. In one case, attachment of Helicobacter pylori to fucosylated or sialylated glycans produced by various gastric epithelial lineages and their progenitors skews the destiny of colonization toward pathogenicity. In the second case, a molecular dissection of how Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a normal inhabitant of the distal small intestine, is able to communicate with intestinal epithelial cells has revealed a novel role for host fucosylated glycans in forging a mutually beneficial relationship. These observations lend support to the hypothesis that the capacity to synthesize diverse carbohydrate structures may have arisen in part from our need to both evade pathogenic relationships and to coevolve symbiotic relationships with our nonpathogenic resident microbes.'",2
"b'Ovarian granulosa cells synthesize anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycans (aHSPGs), which bind and activate antithrombin III. To determine if aHSPGs could contribute to the control of proteolytic activities involved in follicular development and ovulation, we studied the pattern of expression of these proteoglycans during the ovarian cycle. aHSPGs were localized on cells and tissues by 125I-labeled antithrombin III binding followed by microscopic autoradiography. Localization of aHSPGs has shown that cultured granulosa cells, hormonally stimulated by gonadotropins to differentiate in vitro, up-regulate their synthesis and release of aHSPGs. In vivo, during gonadotropin-stimulated cycle, aHSPGs are present on granulosa cells of antral follicles and are strongly labeled in preovulatory follicles. These data demonstrate that aHSPG expression in the ovarian follicle is hormonally induced to culminate in preovulatory follicles. Moreover, we have shown that five heparan sulfate core proteins mRNA (perlecan; syndecan-1, -2, and -4; and glypican-1) are synthesized by granulosa cells, providing attachment for anticoagulant heparan sulfate chains on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. These core proteins are constantly expressed during the cycle, indicating that modulations of aHSPG levels observed in the ovary are likely controlled at the level of the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. This expression pattern enables aHSPGs to focus serine protease inhibitors in the developing follicle to control proteolysis and fibrin formation at ovulation.'",2
"b""Functional neuroimaging, psychophysical and electrophysiological investigations were performed in a patient with non-decussating retinal\x96fugal fibre syndrome, an inborn achiasmatic state in which the retinal projections of each eye map entirely to the ipsilateral primary visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed that for monocularly presented simple visual stimuli, only the ipsilateral striate cortex was activated. Within each hemisphere's striate cortex, the representation of the two hemifields overlapped extensively. Despite this gross miswiring, visual functions that require precise geometrical information (such as vernier acuity) were normal, and there was no evidence for the confounding of visual information between the overlapping ipsi-lateral and contralateral representations. Contrast sensitivity and velocity judgments were abnormal, but their dependence on the orientation and velocity of the targets suggests that this deficit was due to ocular instabilities, rather than the miswiring per se. There were no asymmetries in performance observed in visual search, visual naming or illusory contour perception. fMRI analysis of the latter two tasks under monocular viewing conditions indicated extensive bilateral activation of striate and prestriate areas. Thus, the remarkably normal visual behavior achieved by this patient is a result of both the plasticity of visual pathways, and efficient transfer of information between the hemispheres.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'Recently, cDNAs encoding human chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 and -2 (C4ST-1 and C4ST-2) were cloned based on their similarity to HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) (Hiraoka, N., Nakagawa, H., Ong, E., Akama, T.O., Fukuda, M.N., and Fukuda, M. [2000] Molecular cloning and expression of two distinct human chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases that belong to the HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene family. J. Biol. Chem., 275, 20188\x9620196). In the present study, we identified two additional novel sulfotransferases by searching the expression sequence tag and genomic DNA database for enzymes similar to C4ST-1 and C4ST-2. These newly cloned enzymes, termed GalNAc4ST-1 and GalNAc4ST-2, belong to the HNK-1ST gene family having 40\x9642% identity with C4ST-1. GalNAc4ST-1 and -2 do not add sulfate to HNK-1 precursor glycans, chondroitin, or desulfated dermatan sulfate. Instead, both enzymes can transfer sulfate to the 4-position of GalNAc in the context of GalNAc\xdf1->4GlcNAc\xdf1->R attached to both N-linked and core 2 branched O-linked oligosaccharides. GalNAc4ST-1 and -2 transcripts are highly expressed in the pituitary gland and trachea, respectively, and GalNAc4ST-1 and -2 transcripts are reciprocally expressed in other tissues as well. Moreover, both enzymes can transfer sulfate to lutropin, a pituitary glycoprotein hormone. These combined results indicate that GalNAc4ST-1 and -2 play critical roles in forming sulfo->4GalNAc\xdf1->4GlcNAc\xdf1->R in both N-glycans and O-glycans in a tissue-specific manner.'",2
"b'Neuroimaging studies have shown that motor structures are activated not only during overt motor behavior but also during tasks that require no overt motor behavior, such as motor imagery and mental rotation. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the primary motor cortex is needed for mental rotation by using single- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the representation of the hand in left primary motor cortex while participants performed mental rotation of pictures of hands and feet. Relative to a peripheral magnetic stimulation control condition, response times (RTs) were slower when TMS was delivered at 650 ms but not at 400 ms after stimulus onset. The magnetic stimulation effect at 650 ms was larger for hands than for feet. These findings demonstrate that (i) activation of the left primary motor cortex has a causal role in the mental rotation of pictures of hands; (ii) this role is stimulus-specific because disruption of neural activity in the hand area slowed RTs for pictures of hands more than feet; and (iii) left primary motor cortex is involved relatively late in the mental rotation process.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'The Myers\x96Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality test, was used to profile the personalities of in-patient alcoholics/substance-use disorder patients who had, and those who did not have, a concurrent affective disorder diagnosis.

Alcohol/substance-use disorder patients with no affective disorder differed from a normative population only in being significantly more often Sensing and significantly less often Intuitive single-factor types. The Extroverted/Sensing/ Feeling/Judging four-factor type was also significantly over-represented in this group, compared to a normative population.

"b'Many human gastrointestinal facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria possess alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and are therefore capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde. We examined whether human gastrointestinal lactobacilli (three strains), bifidobacteria (five strains) and probiotic Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 are also able to metabolize ethanol and acetaldehyde in vitro. Acetaldehyde production by bacterial suspensions was determined by gas chromatography after a 1-h incubation with 22 mM ethanol. To determine the acetaldehyde consumption, the suspensions were incubated with 50 \xb5M or 500 \xb5M acetaldehyde as well as with 500 \xb5M acetaldehyde and 22 mM ethanol, i.e. under conditions resembling those in the human colon after alcohol intake. The influence of growth media and bacterial concentration on the ability of lactobacilli to metabolize acetaldehyde and to produce acetate from acetaldehyde were determined. ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Neither measurable ADH nor ALDH activities were found in aerobically grown Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 strains. All the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains revealed a very limited capacity to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde in vitro. Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 had the highest acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity, which increased significantly with increasing bacterial concentrations. This was associated with a marked production of acetate from acetaldehyde. The type of the growth media had no effect on acetaldehyde consumption. Addition of ethanol to the incubation media diminished the acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity of all strains. However, in the presence of ethanol, Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 still demonstrated the highest capacity for acetaldehyde metabolism of all strains. These data suggest a beneficial impact of Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103 on high gastrointestinal acetaldehyde levels following alcohol intake. The possible clinical implications of this finding remain to be established in in vitro studies.'",0
"b'The functional organization of primary auditory cortex in non-primates is generally modeled as a tonotopic gradient with an orthogonal representation of independently mapped binaural interaction columns along the isofrequency contours. Little information is available regarding the validity of this model in the primate brain, despite the importance of binaural cues for sound localization and auditory scene analysis. Binaural and monaural responses of A1 to pure tone stimulation were studied using auditory evoked potentials, current source density and multiunit activity. Key findings include: (i) differential distribution of binaural responses with respect to best frequency, such that 74% of the sites exhibiting binaural summation had best frequencies below 2000 Hz; (ii) the pattern of binaural responses was variable with respect to cortical depth, with binaural summation often observed in the supragranular laminae of sites showing binaural suppression in thalamorecipient laminae; and (iii) dissociation of binaural responses between the initial and sustained action potential firing of neuronal ensembles in A1. These data support earlier findings regarding the temporal and spatial complexity of responses in A1 in the awake state, and are inconsistent with a simple orthogonal arrangement of binaural interaction columns and best frequency in A1 of the awake primate.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Several sets of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) play important roles in apoptosis induced by various extracellular stresses. Anti-cancer drugs induce cellular DNA damage and cytotoxic events, leading to apoptotic cell death. We utilized the established chicken B cell line, DT40 cells and their derived mutants, lacking the respective PTK [DT40/Syk(\x96), DT40/Lyn(\x96) and DT40/Btk(\x96)], to examine a role of these PTK in apoptotic processes induced by anti-cancer drugs. All anti-cancer drugs examined induced apoptosis of wild-type DT40 cells. Interestingly,DT40/Lyn(\x96), but not DT40/Syk(\x96) and DT40/Btk(\x96) cells, become resistant to apoptosis induced by adriamycin and etoposide, topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitory agents, compared to wild-type DT40 cells, as assessed by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL analyses. Ectopic expression of Fyn, another Src family member, in DT40/Lyn(\x96) cells restores largely the susceptibility of the cells against Topo II inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, it was found that Topo II inhibitors activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) slightly in both wild-type and DT40/Lyn(\x96) cells to similar extents. Collectively, these results suggest that Lyn is involved in Topo II inhibitor-induced apoptotic signaling in DT40 cells independent of JNK.'",4
"b'To examine the association between pre-diagnostic serum carotenoid levels and lung cancer risk and the effects of alcohol intake on the carotenoid\x96lung cancer relationship, we conducted a case-control study in an occupational cohort from the Yunnan Tin Corporation in China.

"b'In the first of two experiments, the effects of ethyl alcohol on monaural and binaural thresholds for pure tones were measured for a range of frequencies. The results showed a frequency-specific effect in which low frequencies were more severely affected than higher ones. Also, monaural thresholds tended to be more affected by alcohol than binaural ones. The second experiment extended this exploration by measuring frequency discrimination at several different frequencies. In this case, we also obtained a frequency-dependent effect: the increase in discrimination thresholds above 1000 Hz was three times greater than that for lower frequencies. The data suggest that the choice of stimuli may influence the ability to detect changes in auditory performance after alcohol and may account in part for the differences among earlier studies. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol is acting centrally, at the level of mechanisms involved in the temporal and binaural summation of auditory signals, rather than influencing peripheral structures.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Injection of acetylcholine (ACh) (2.5\x9660 nmol) into the anterior cingulate cortex caused dose-dependent hypotensive responses (Emax = \x9625.3 mmHg) and no change in the heart rate. The hypotensive response to 30 nmol of ACh was blocked by local pretreatment with atropine (3 nmol) or 4-DAMP (6.7 nmol), a non-tropine muscarinic antagonist. When the same dose of atropine was injected i.v., no changes were observed in the hypotensive response to intracortical ACh. This observation rules out the possible leakage of ACh into the peripheral circulation and favors the idea of a cortical site of action. The injection of the same dose of ACh into the corpus callosum or the occipital cortex did not cause changes in the cardiovascular system. The present results confirm earlier evidence that the cingulate cortex is involved in the control of the autonomic system and indicate that cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the cingulate cortex mediate a hypotensive response without a change in heart rate.'",1
"b'To study human [alpha]1,3/1,4fucosyltransferase (Fuc-TIII) as an [alpha]1,3 fucosyltransferase, we constructed two cell clones, C127-FT and C127-T-FT, by transfecting cDNA in parental (C127) or Polyoma T antigen expressing (C127-T) mouse cells, respectively. Both C127-FT and C127-T-FT clones express high levels of a fucosyltransferase activity kinetically similar to Fuc-TIII and an RNA that is amplified by a Fuc-TIII-specific oligonucleotide primer pair after reverse transcription.

Immunoblotting confirms that C127-FT glycoproteins acquire Lewisx reactivity only after specific deglycosylation, and shows that a small subset of Griffonia simplicifolia I isolectin B4 reactive glycoproteins bears masked Lewisx, suggesting fine substrate recognition by Fuc-TIII. Moreover, transient transfection of H type [alpha]1,2fucosyltransferase in clone C127-T-FT directs synthesis of Lewisy antigen, as detected by flow cytometry.

"b'In the previous paper the locations and basic response properties of N200 and other face-specific event-related potentials (ERPs) were described. In this paper responsiveness of N200 and related ERPs to the perceptual features of faces and other images was assessed. N200 amplitude did not vary substantially, whether evoked by colored or grayscale faces; normal, blurred or line-drawing faces; or by faces of different sizes. Human hands evoked small N200s at face-specific sites, but evoked hand-specific ERPs at other sites. Cat and dog faces evoked N200s that were 73% as large as to human faces. Hemifield stimulation demonstrated that the right hemisphere is better at processing information about upright faces and transferring it to the left hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is better at processing information about inverted faces and transferring it to the right hemisphere. N200 amplitude was largest to full faces and decreased progressively to eyes, face contours, lips and noses viewed in isolation. A region just lateral to face-specific N200 sites was more responsive to internal face parts than to faces, and some sites in ventral occipitotemporal cortex were face-partspecific. Faces with eyes averted or closed evoked larger N200s than those evoked by faces with eyes forward. N200 amplitude and latency were affected by the joint effects of eye and head position in the right but not in the left hemisphere. Full and three-quarter views of faces evoked larger N200s than did profile views. The results are discussed in relation to behavioral studies in humans and single-cell recordings in monkeys.'",1
"b'Background Although there is an ever increasing literature on older drivers, there is no comprehensive up-to-date presentation of how older drivers are impacted by traffic safety, and how they impact the road safety of others.\r\n\r\nMethods This paper uses 1994\x961996 US data to determine how many rates related to traffic safety depend on the age and sex of road users (fatalities, fatalities per licensed driver, etc.) Threats drivers pose to other road users are estimated by driver involvement in pedestrian fatality crashes.\r\n\r\nResults It is found that renewing the licence of a 70-year-old male driver for another year poses, on average, 40% less threat to other road users than renewing the license of a 40-year-old male driver. The fatality risks drivers themselves face generally increase as they age, with the increased risk of death in the same severity crash being a major contributor. If this factor is removed, crash risks for 70-year-old male drivers are not materially higher than for 40-year-old male drivers; for female drivers they are.\r\n\r\nConclusions Most driver rates increase substantially by age 80, in many cases to values higher than those for 20-year-olds. Given that a death occurs, the probability that it is a traffic fatality declines steeply with age, from well over 20% for late teens through mid twenties, to under one per cent at age 65, and under half a per cent at age 80.'",3
"b'A neural model suggests how horizontal and interlaminar connections in visual cortical areas V1 and V2 develop within a laminar cortical architecture and give rise to adult visual percepts. The model suggests how mechanisms that control cortical development in the infant lead to properties of adult cortical anatomy, neurophysiology and visual perception. The model clarifies how excitatory and inhibitory connections can develop stably by maintaining a balance between excitation and inhibition. The growth of long-range excitatory horizontal connections between layer 2/3 pyramidal cells is balanced against that of short-range disynaptic interneuronal connections. The growth of excitatory on-center connections from layer 6-to-4 is balanced against that of inhibitory interneuronal off-surround connections. These balanced connections interact via intracortical and intercortical feedback to realize properties of perceptual grouping, attention and perceptual learning in the adult, and help to explain the observed variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes emitted by cortical neurons. The model replicates cortical point spread functions and psychophysical data on the strength of real and illusory contours. The on-center, off-surround layer 6-to-4 circuit enables top-down attentional signals from area V2 to modulate, or attentionally prime, layer 4 cells in area V1 without fully activating them. This modulatory circuit also enables adult perceptual learning within cortical area V1 and V2 to proceed in a stable way.'",1
"b'The opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is reported, in single centre studies, to improve the clinical outcome of individuals with alcohol dependence participating in outpatient psychosocial programmes. This is the first multicentre controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of naltrexone as adjunctive treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse. Patients who met criteria for alcohol dependence (n = 169) or alcohol abuse (n = 6) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind oral naltrexone 50 mg daily (n = 90) or placebo (n = 85) for 12 weeks as an adjunct to psychosocial treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to first episode of heavy drinking; secondary efficacy assessments included time to first drink, alcohol consumption, craving, and changes in the serum biological markers gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Compliance was assessed by tablet counts and, in the naltrexone-treated group, by measurement of urinary concentrations of 6-\xdf-naltrexol. Forty-nine (58%) patients randomized to placebo and 53 (59%) randomized to naltrexone did not complete the study. In intention-to-treat analyses, there was no difference between groups on measures of drinking. The median reduction from baseline of serum GGT (P < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale: OCDS) were greater in the naltrexone group (P < 0.05), from approximately half-way through the study. Of 70 patients (35 placebo; 35 naltrexone) who met an a priori definition of compliance (80% tablet consumption, attendance at all follow-up appointments), those allocated to naltrexone reported consuming half the amount of alcohol (P < 0.05), had greater median reduction in serum GGT activity (P < 0.05), and greater reduction in alcohol craving (OCDS total score: P < 0.05; Obsessive subscale score: P < 0.05), compared to patients in the placebo group. Use of naltrexone raised no safety concerns. Naltrexone is effective in treating alcohol dependence/abuse in conjunction with psychosocial therapy, in patients who comply with treatment.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'In the dextran B512 high-responder strain C57BL, the response to dextran is restricted to the preferential expression of the VHB512 and the V{kappa}OX1 gene combination. The importance of the heavy chain is suggested by the fact that mice with the Ig CH allotype, different from C57BL, are low or non-responders to dextran, but the light chain could also play a role. All anti-dextran B512 mAb described to date (>200) use {kappa} light chains. No anti-dextran antibody using {lambda} has ever been observed. To ascertain if the restriction of the use of V{kappa} genes in response to dextran B512 was more stochastic or due to other factors, we have studied the response to dextran B512 in C57BL/6 mice where the C{kappa} domain has been disrupted (C57BL.C{kappa}T). These mice are unable to express {kappa} light chains and their humoral antibodies bear light chains of the {lambda} type. We found that C{kappa} knockout mice are unable to respond to dextran given in a thymus-independent or -dependent form. The lack of responsiveness is specifically directed to the dextran epitopes since these mice are fully competent to respond to other antigenic structures present in the same immunogenic molecule. These mice are also apparently normal regarding the expression of VH genes. Finally, we tested the response to dextran in C57BL.C{kappa}T mice carrying the lpr mutation that was introduced to favor an increase in the life span and make the response to dextran more easily detectable. The introduction of the lpr mutation was not sufficient to change the pattern of unresponsiveness in the C57BL.C{kappa}T mice. We concluded that there are deficiencies in the light chain repertoire because the V {lambda} light chain could not reconstitute the response to dextran. We discuss the possible mechanisms for this new type of unresponsiveness to dextran B512.'",4

As revealed by flow cytofluorimetric analysis, >70% of isolated cells are CD11c+ and express the dendritic cell (DC) marker 33D1. Additional expression of F4/80 and CD11b suggests a myeloid origin of these cells. The lymphoid DC marker CD8{alpha} is lacking while DEC-205 has been detected on ~10% of the cells. When freshly isolated, such brain-derived DC-like cells are excellent antigen-presenting cells (APC) but their functional capability is lost during subculture with GM-CSF. In contrast, their antigen presentation function remains stable in the presence of GM-CSF plus astrocytes or astrocyte-conditioned medium. The responsible astrocytic activity co-fractionates with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Neutralization of the activity with anti-M-CSF antibody and substitution with recombinant M-CSF provide evidence that, in addition to GM-CSF, M-CSF is required to preserve the functional capability of these brain-derived APC. Responsiveness of the isolated cells to M-CSF is substantiated by the expression of c-fms/M-CSF receptor gene. Consistently, GM-CSF proves stimulatory for astrocytes by up-regulating their secretion of M-CSF. Furthermore, depletion or blocking of endogenous M-CSF in primary brain cell culture prevents the development of functionally active APC regardless of exogenous GM-CSF. In sum, these findings ascribe an immature DC phenotype to GM-CSF-grown myeloid brain cells and indicate a role for astrocytic M-CSF in maintaining their antigen presentation function'",4
"b'Different rat Tcrb haplotypes express either TCR \xdf variable segment (Tcrb-V) 8.2l or 8.4a. Both V segments bind the mAb R78 but differ by one conservative substitution (L14V) and clusters of two and four substitutions in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2 and CDR4 [hypervariable loop 4 (HV4)]. Independently of MHC alleles numbers of R78+CD4+ cells are lower in Tcrb-V8.2l-expressing than in Tcrb-V8.4a-expressing strains. Expression of R78+ TCR during T cell development, analysis of backcross populations and generation of a Tcrb congenic strain [LEW.TCRB(AS)] define two mechanisms how Tcrb haplotypes affect the frequency of R78+ cells, one acting prior to thymic selection leading to up to 2-fold higher frequency of Tcrb-V8.4a versus Tcrb-V8.2l in unselected thymocytes and another occurring between the TCRlow and the CD4/CD8 single-positive stage. The latter leads to a 50% reduction of frequency of Tcrb-V8.4a CD8+ cells but not CD4+ cells and does not affect either subset of Tcrb-V8.2l cells. A comparison of rat classical class I MHC (RT1.A) sequences and current models of TCR\x96MHC\x96peptide interaction suggests that this reduction in frequency of Tcrb-V8.4a CD8 cells may be a consequence of differential selection of Tcrb-V8.2l versus Tcrb-V8.4a TCR by differential binding of CDR2\xdf to highly conserved areas of C-terminal parts of the {alpha} helices of class I MHC molecules.'",4
"b'De-N-acetylation of N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylino-sitol (GlcNAc-PI) is the second step of glycosylphosphatidylino-sitol (GPI) membrane anchor biosynthesis in eukaryotes. This step is a prerequisite for the subsequent processing of glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) that leads to mature GPI membrane anchor precursors, which are transferred to certain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this article, we used a direct de-N-acetylase assay, based on the release of [14C]acetate from synthetic GlcN[14C]Ac-PI and analogues thereof, and an indirect assay, based on the mannosylation of GlcNAc-PI analogues, to study the substrate specificities of the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activities of African trypanosomes and human (HeLa) cells. The HeLa enzyme was found to be more fastidious than the trypanosomal enzyme such that, unlike the trypanosomal enzyme, it was unable to act on a GlcNAc-PI analogue containing 2-O-octyl-d-myo-inositol or on the GlcNAc-PI diastereoisomer containing l-myo-inositol (GlcNAc-P(l)I). These results suggest thatselective inhibition of the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase may be possible and that this enzyme should be considered as a possible therapeutic target. The lack of strict stereospecificity of the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase for the d-myo-inositol component was also seen for the trypanosomal GPI [alpha]-manno-syltransferases when GlcNAc-P(l)I was added to the trypanosome cell-free system, but not when GlcN-P(l)I was used. In an attempt to rationalize these data, we modeled the structure and dynamics of d-GlcNAc[alpha]1-6d-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-(sn)-3-glycerol and its diastereoisomer d-GlcNAc[alpha]1-6l-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-(sn)-3-glycerol. These studies indicate that the latter compound visits two energy minima, one of which resembles the low-energy conformer of former compound. Thus, it is conceivable that the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase acts on GlcNAc-P(l)I when it occupies a GlcNAc-PI-likeconformation and that GlcN-P(l)I emerging from the de-N-acetylase may be channeled to the [alpha]-mannosyltransferases in this conformation.'",2
"b'In this study we examined the thalamic connectivity developed by grafts of embryonic (E16) parietal or occipital cortex placed homo- or heterotopically into the neocortex of newborn rats. We also examined the cytoarchitectonic organization developed by the grafts. Our findings indicate that E16 parietal cortex grafted into the parietal cortex of newborn recipients develops reciprocal connections with the host thalamic ventrobasal complex (VB) but does not establish connections with the host dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG). When implanted into the occipital cortex, these grafts are still able to establish connections with the VB. In contrast, E16 occipital cortex grafted into the parietal cortex establishes only a few connections with the VB. These grafts are, however, able to develop a substantial system of connections with the host DLG. At 16 days of embryonic age, graft cells are committed to establish thalamic connections appropriate to their tangential locus of origin. In addition, our results show that E16 parietal or occipital cortical cells do not possess the capacity to differentiate and maintain barrel organization even though they are grafted into the terminal field of developing VB axons.'",1
"b'Recent evidence suggests that co-stimulation provided by B7 molecules through CTLA-4 is important in establishing peripheral tolerance. In the present study, we examined the kinetics of tolerance induction and T cell differentiation following i.p. administration of myelin basic protein (MBP) Ac1\x9611 in mice transgenic for a TCR V\xdf8.2 gene derived from an encephalitogenic T cell clone specific for MBP Ac1\x9611. Examination of the lymph node cell response after antigen administration demonstrated a dependence on CTLA-4 for i.p. tolerance induction. Examination of splenocyte responses suggested that i.p. antigen administration induced a Th2 response, which was potentiated by anti-CTLA-4 administration. Interestingly, i.p. tolerance was able to inhibit the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and anti-CTLA-4 administration did not alter this phenotype, suggesting that CTLA-4 blockade did not block tolerance induction. Thus, T cell differentiation and the dependence on CTLA-4 for tolerance induction following i.p. antigen administration differs between lymph node and spleen in a model of organ-specific autoimmunity.'",4
"b'Specific antibodies increase antigen uptake and presentation by antigen-presenting cells via the B cell receptor in B cells or Fc{gamma}R in dendritic cells. To determine whether the interaction between antibody and antigen could influence the set of peptides presented by MHC II molecules, we analyzed the presentation of different CD4+ T cell epitopes of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) after the capture of immune complexes formed between HEL and seven different specific mAb. The 103\x96117 T cell epitope (I-Ed) was specifically and selectively up-regulated by the D1.3 and F9.13.7 mAb that binds to proximal loops in the native structure of HEL. Furthermore, Ii-independent T cell epitopes exposed on the HEL surface (116\x96129 and 34\x9645, I-Ak restricted) which require a mild processing involving the recycling of MHC II molecules were selectively up-regulated by mAb that overlap those T cell epitopes (D1.3 and D44.1). However, F10.6.6, somatically derived from the same germ line genes as D44.1 and exhibiting an higher affinity for HEL, was without effect on the presentation of the 34\x9645 epitope. An Ii-dependent T cell epitope buried into the tertiary structure of HEL (45\x9661, I-Ak restricted) and requiring the neosynthesis of MHC II was up-regulated by high-affinity mAb recognizing epitopes located at the N- or C-terminus of the T cell epitope. These results strongly suggest that (i) the spatial relationship linking the T cell epitope and the B cell epitope recognized by the mAb, (ii) the intrinsic processing requirements of the T cell epitope, and (iii) the antibody affinity influences the presentation of a given T cell epitope.'",4
"b'The present study investigates the functional deficits of naive auditory cortices in adult congenitally deaf cats. For this purpose, their auditory system was stimulated electrically using cochlear implants. Synaptic currents in cortical layers were revealed using current source density analyses. They were compared with synaptic currents found in electrically stimulated hearing cats. The naive auditory cortex showed significant deficits in synaptic activity in infragranular cortical layers. Furthermore, there was also a deficit of synaptic activities at longer latencies (>30 ms). The \x91cortical column\x92 was not activated in the well-defined sequence found in normal hearing cats. These results demonstrate functional deficits as a consequence of congenital auditory deprivation. Similar deficits are likely in congenitally deaf children.\r\n\r\nDifferent pathological conditions, e.g. blindness, deafness and amputations, can lead to functional deprivation of the central nervous system. With recent methods it is possible to substitute some of the lost functions (e.g. using cochlear implants). However, patients are often not fully able to exploit the possibilities of such prostheses, as the deprived nervous system has not been sufficiently trained to analyse the afferent activity. Congenital deprivation has the most serious consequences and the resulting deficits may be irreversible. In the visual system, for example, it has been demonstrated that monocular deprivation during a critical period of life (the first 4 months in the cat) influences the functional properties of the primary sensory cortical areas (Hubel and Wiesel, 1970Go, Blakemore, 1978Go). The deficits largely persist if initial stimulation takes place after this critical period. Binocular deprivation leads to a substantial reduction in visually responsive cells and loss of their orientation specificity in the primary visual cortex [for a review see e.g. (Rauschecker, 1991Go)].\r\n\r\nCritical periods also appear to exist in the auditory system. Language development, dependent on the auditory system, is known to have a critical period [for a review see (Skuse, 1993Go)]. Transient expression of acetylcholinesterase, seen in the rat visual and somatosensory cortices during their critical period, is also found in the auditory cortex with a similar time-course (Robertson, 1987Go; Robertson et al., 1991Go). The cholinergic system is known to be involved in learning effects in the auditory cortex (Juliano, 1998Go; Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998Go; Weinberger, 1998Go) and might play a role in the formation of thalamocortical connections. Lesion studies, in the cochlea as well as in the central nervous system, support the idea of a critical period in auditory development (Harrison et al., 1991Go) [for a review of central lesions see e.g. (Wakita and Watanabe, 1997Go)], as do the data from congenitally deaf individuals equipped with cochlear implants (Eddington et al., 1978Go; Busby et al., 1992Go; Fryauf-Bertschy et al., 1997Go). If congenitally deaf patients are implanted during childhood they can gain complete language competence. However, congenitally deaf patients implanted as adults have significantly poorer auditory performance and do not gain comparable language competence. The deficits in the auditory system responsible for their poor performance remain to be explored.\r\n\r\nThe congenitally deaf white cat (CDC) is a suitable naturally occurring model of congenital deafness (Larsen and Kirchhoff, 1992Go; Saada et al., 1996Go; Heid et al., 1998Go). CDCs suffer from a dysplasia of the organ of Corti. The inner and outer hair cells are completely missing at an age when hearing starts in normal animals. A similar degeneration (Scheibe dysplasia) is most frequently found in human congenital nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. No further neurological defects have been discovered so far in CDCs (Saada et al., 1996Go). In contrast to pharmacologically deafened animals (Leake-Jones et al., 1982Go; Xu et al., 1993Go; Hardie and Shepherd, 1999Go), the primary afferents of CDCs are relatively well preserved (90% preservation after 2 years in the basal half turn of the cochlea) (Heid et al., 1998Go). Only the basal halfturn of the cat cochlea can be reached by cochlear implant electrical stimulation (Hartmann et al., 1997Go; Kral et al., 1998Go). Thus the effect of spiral ganglion degeneration does not have to be taken into account in the CDCs, as is the case in pharmacologically deafened animals (Hardie and Shepherd, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nBecause of the early degeneration of the cochlea, the auditory cortex of the CDC does not receive any sound-evoked input. Developmental processes dependent on acoustic stimulation cannot take place. However, the brainstem of these animals is anatomically well developed (Heid et al., 1997Go). The afferent connections of the brainstem show nucleotopic organization (Heid et al., 1997Go). In their auditory cortex, a rudimentary cochleotopy has been demonstrated by single unit recordings and middle-latency responses (Hartmann et al., 1997Go).\r\n\r\nIn the present paper, the question of functional deficits in the acoustically naive auditory cortex is addressed. Indications that abnormalities in neurons, synapses and neuronal connections appear as a consequence of auditory deprivation have been found (Neville and Lawson, 1987Go; McMullen et al., 1988Go; Larsen and Kirchhoff, 1992Go; Chugani et al., 1996Go; Ponton et al., 1996Go; Heid et al., 1997Go; Kotak and Sanes, 1997Go; Moore et al., 1997Go; Niparko and Finger, 1997Go; Hardie et al., 1998Go; Ryugo et al., 1998Go; Nishimura et al., 1999Go; Hardie and Shepherd, 1999Go; Wurth et al., 1999Go). Nevertheless, functional data about the deprivation effects on the auditory cortex are not yet available. According to the work of Mitani et al. (Mitani et al., 1985Go) and Prieto et al. (Prieto et al., 1994Go), the different layers of the auditory cortex are activated in a well-defined temporal sequence (Aitkin, 1990Go). Is this pattern established in congenitally deaf animals? To answer this question, gross synaptic currents in different layers of the auditory cortex were compared between electrically stimulated normal hearing cats and CDCs using current source density (CSD) analyses.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We have isolated a cDNA encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from a bovine kidney cDNA-library, the first mammalian cDNA clone published. [After submission of the manuscript, a study appeared describing the molecular cloning and characterization of the human and mouse UDP-glucose dehydrogenase genes (Spicer et al., 1998).] The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, an essential precursor in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The cDNA has an open reading frame of 1482 nucleotides coding for a 55 kDa protein. Expression of the enzyme in COS-7 cells showed a 3-fold increase in UDP-glucose dehydrogenase activity; also, the C-terminal 23 amino acids was shown not to be necessary for enzyme activity. Northern blots from human and mouse tissues reveal high expression in liver and low in skeletal muscle. Human tissues have a major transcript size of 3.2 kilobases and a minor of 2.6 whereas mouse tissues have a single 2.6 kilobase transcript. We have also developed a sensitive and direct assay using UDP-[14C]Glc as a substrate for detection of small amounts of UDPGDH activity.'",2
"b'In November of 1996, the British Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published an RCOG Guideline consisting of a brief overview with conclusions and recommendations concerning alcohol consumption during pregnancy (see Appendix). On the basis of present knowledge, we believe that some of the conclusions and recommendations may not be sound or may even convey some risk. The first conclusion of the RCOG Guideline states, \x91No adverse effects on pregnancy outcome have been proven with a consumption of less than 120 g of alcohol (around 15 units) per week\x92. A similar statement is made in the recommendations section. Although it is true that current evidence is not consistent in showing a clear relationship between lower levels of maternal alcohol consumption and adverse effects in the offspring, there are reasonable data that suggest that even low levels of ethanol consumption may be harmful to the fetus. For example, Day et al. (1994) reported a dose\x96 response relationship between several parameters of growth (assessed to 6 years of age) and average daily volume of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Adverse effects were clearly seen at one drink/day (13 g of ethanol/day), a level that the RCOG Guideline seems to tolerate. The above group (Goldschmidt et al., 1996Go) also reported a linear dose\x96response function between alcohol consumption and deficits on an arithmetic achievement test (the WRAT-R). Threshold effects of about one drink/day were found for the reading and spelling achievement subtests.\r\n\r\nThe RCOG Guideline ends with a recommendation that no more than one drink be consumed/day, but the majority of the paper emphasizes consumption levels on a weekly basis (e.g. 120 g or 15 U/week). We are very concerned that these weekly levels will become the benchmark against which risk is judged. An important factor to consider is whether the weekly intake is consumed on only one or two occasions (binge drinking) or divided over the entire week. There are substantial data indicating that blood-alcohol level, rather than the dose consumed, is critical in determining effects from prenatal alcohol exposure (e.g. Bonthius and West, 1990). Drinking 5 U, or 40 g of alcohol/ occasion once or twice a week, probably has a greater impact on development than the same amount consumed over a longer time (Jacobson et al., 1993Go; Jacobson and Jacobson, 1994Go; Streissguth et al., 1994Go). Indeed, Jacobson and Jacobson (1994) estimated that, when concentrated on one or two occasions/week, the lower threshold of maternal drinking for producing intellectual deficits is 91 g/week. A relationship between the Bayley Mental Developmental Index and pregnancy drinking level was found even in light drinkers (3.5\x966.9 drinks/week or 45\x9689.7 g of ethanol/week) (Jacobson and Jacobson, 1994Go). Results from the Seattle longitudinal study also reported dose-dependent neurobehavioural effects, generally without a threshold, from the first day of life to 14 years of age (Streissguth et al., 1994Go, 1996Go). Furthermore, it may be that alcohol exposure of less than 120 g/week may cause cognitive and behavioural abnormalities, but that these only become apparent when the child is challenged during the school years (Streissguth et al., 1994Go, 1996Go).\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous animal studies showing that low blood-alcohol levels can induce both brain damage and behavioural alterations, including permanent decreases in the number of Purkinje and granule cells in the cerebellum (Napper and West, 1995Go), alterations in long-term potentiation (Savage et al., 1991Go) and impairments in learning and memory (Vaglenova and Petkov, 1998Go). Blood-alcohol levels equivalent to those noted in these animal studies (30\x9640 mg/dl), can be attained in a 60-kg individual after the consumption of 18 g of ethanol (Fraser et al., 1995Go).\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be cautioned that threshold values are based upon group averages, therefore it is not appropriate to infer that exposure below a threshold level is necessarily \x91safe\x92, because of the marked inter- and intra-individual variations in alcohol pharmacokinetics (Eckardt et al., 1998Go). Some women or fetuses may be particularly susceptible or sensitive to these prenatal alcohol exposures. For example, the risk for intellectual impairment increased substantially in the offspring of women over the age of 30 years who drank during pregnancy (Jacobson et al., 1996Go).\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, we have much to learn about the consequences of lower levels of alcohol exposure during pregnancy and how these exposures might interact with various medical and environmental conditions. However, contrary to the conclusions in the RCOG, we believe that there are reasonable data indicating functional and physical consequences following exposure levels of less than 120 g of ethanol/week. Although we may never know the amount of alcohol any particular woman needs to consume to affect her child, we do know that these effects are 100% preventable. While one might advise the pregnant woman who has been drinking less than 2 U/day that the risk to the fetus is relatively small, given the current data, it would be clinically prudent to advise abstention during pregnancy.'",0
"b'Antigen-coupled antigen-presenting cells (APC) serve as potent tolerogens for inhibiting immune responses in vivo and in vitro, apparently by providing an antigen-specific signal through the TCR in the absence of co-stimulation. Although this approach has been well studied in rodents, little is known about its effects on human T cells. We evaluated the specificity and mechanisms of tolerization of human T cells in vitro using monocyte-enriched adherent cells that were pulsed with antigen and treated with the cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (ECDI). Autologous antigen-coupled APC selectively tolerized T cells of the Th1 but not Th2 lineage through a mechanism that involved both antigen-specific and antigen-non-specific elements. The tolerization process was dependent on the ECDI and antigen concentration, and the coupling time, and was reflected by initial up-regulation of CD25. However, upon re-stimulation with fresh APC and antigen, tolerized Th1 cells failed to proliferate or to produce Th1 cytokine message or secreted protein, had decreased expression of CD25, CD28 and B7 and increased expression of MHC class II molecules, and demonstrated an enhanced commitment to apoptosis. Th1 cell tolerization could be prevented by adding anti-CD28 antibody, IL-2 or untreated APC at the same time as the ECDI/antigen-coupled APC, or reversed by adding anti-CD28 antibody or IL-2 upon re-stimulation with fresh APC plus antigen. Thus, the tolerizing effect of ECDI/antigen-coupled APC on human Th1 cells appears to involve a reversible anergy mechanism leading to apoptosis, whereby the targeted T cells receive full or partial activation through the TCR, without coordinate co-stimulation. These data suggest dichotomous signaling requirements for inactivating cells of the Th1 and Th2 lineages that may have important implications for treatment of Th1-mediated autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.'",4
"b'To evaluate the ability to infer alcohol consumption using the %CDT (carbohydrate deficient transferrin) immunoassay (Axis Shield). Methods: One hundred and eighty-three healthy subjects (143 men, 40 women) undergoing a routine medical check-up at their workplace declared frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption covering the last 4 weeks. Seven sub-groups were made up from this population, according to daily ethanol intake and by increments of 10 g from 0 to 70 g/day. A reference group that consisted of 133 healthy teetotallers (74 men, 59 women) was recruited by occupational medicine in the same conditions as the 183 subjects of the study. Percentage CDT and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were assayed on a fasting blood sample. Results: There was a proportional dose\x96response effect of daily ethanol intake on %CDT values in the range of 0\x9670 g per day. A threshold effect on %CDT values for patients having an alcohol intake of over 40 g per day was found, an effect which was not observed for GGT activity. Conclusion: The kit has clinical usefulness, and the value of 2.6% proposed by the manufacturer for the cut-off for hazardous drinking in both sexes has been validated.'",0
"b'Conglutinin is a serum lectin of the innate immune system, which binds high mannose N-glycans when these are appropriately presented on proteins. Here we use the conglutinin-ribonuclease B (RNaseB)-recognition system as a model to investigate the structural basis of selective recognition of protein-bound oligosaccharides by this carbohydrate-binding receptor. Conglutinin shows little binding to the isolated RNaseB-Man8 glycoform, and no binding to Man5-6 glycoforms. In contrast, when the protein moiety is reduced and denatured we observe that conglutinin binds strongly to the isolated RNaseB-Man8 glycoform and weakly to the Man5-6 glycoforms. These results are in accord with observations on the binding to the N-glycans in the absence of carrier protein. NMR analyses of native RNaseB-Man8 and -Man5-6 glycoforms reveal that the three-dimensional structure of the protein moiety is essentially identical to that of non-glycosylated RNase (RNaseA). Thus there are no perceptible differences between the RNase protein forms that could account for differential availability of the N-glycan for conglutinin-binding. After reduction and denaturation, the NMR spectrum became typical of a non-structured polypeptide, although the conformational preferences of the N-glycosidic linkage were unchanged, and most importantly, the Man8 oligosaccharide retained the average conformational behavior of the free oligosaccharide irrespective of the carrier protein fold. This conformational freedom is clearly not translated into full availability of the oligosaccharide for the carbohydrate-recognition protein. We propose, therefore, that the differing bioactivity of the N-glycan is a reflection of the existence of different geometries of presentation of the carbohydrate determinant in relation to the protein surface within the glycan:carrier protein ensemble.'",2
"b""The central executive is both an important and poorly understood construct that is invoked in current theoretical models of human cognition and in various dysexecutive clinical syndromes. We report a task designed to isolate one elementary executive function, namely the allocation of attentional resources within working memory. The frequency with which attention was switched between items in working memory was varied across different trials, while storage and rehearsal demands were held constant. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed widespread areas, both prefrontal and more posterior, that differentially activated as a function of a trial's executive demands. Furthermore, areas that differed as a function of executive demands tended to lie adjacent to areas that were activated during the task but that did not so differ. Together, these data suggest that a distributed neuroanatomy, rather than a specific and unique locus, underlies this attention switching executive function.""",1
"b'Electrophysiological studies on monkeys have been able to distinguish sensory and motor signals close in time by pseudo- randomly delaying the cue that instructs the movement from the stimulus that triggers the movement. We have used a similar experimental design in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), scanning subjects while they performed a visuomotor conditional task with instructed delays. One of four shapes was presented briefly. Two shapes instructed the subjects to flex the index finger; the other two shapes coded the flexion of the middle finger. The subjects were told to perform the movement after a tone. We have exploited a novel use of event-related fMRI. By systematically varying the interval between the visual and acoustic stimuli, it has been possible to estimate the significance of the evoked h\xe6modynamic response (EHR) to each of the stimuli, despite their temporal proximity in relation to the time constant of the EHR. Furthermore, by varying the phase between events and image acquisition, we have been able to achieve high temporal resolution while scanning the whole brain. We dissociated sensory and motor components of the sensorimotor transformations elicited by the task, and assessed sustained activity during the instructed delays. In calcarine and occipitotemporal cortex, the responses were exclusively associated with the visual instruction cues. In temporal auditory cortex and in primary motor cortex, they were exclusively associated with the auditory trigger stimulus. In ventral prefrontal cortex there were movement-related responses preceded by preparatory activity and by signal-related activity. Finally, responses associated with the instruction cue and with sustained activity during the delay period were observed in the dorsal premotor cortex and in the dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Where the association between a visual cue and the appropriate movement is arbitrary, the underlying visuomotor transformations are not achieved exclusively through frontoparietal interactions. Rather, these processes seem to rely on the ventral visual stream, the ventral prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of the dorsal premotor cortex.'",1
"b'Background A striking difference in fish consumption and lung cancer mortality (LCM) exists among populations worldwide. This study investigated the relation between fish consumption and LCM at the population level.\r\n\r\nMethods Sex-specific LCM data, mostly around 1993 and fish consumption data for 10 periods 1961\x961994 in 36 countries were obtained from WHO and FAO, respectively.\r\n\r\nResults A significant inverse correlation exists between log fish consumption and LCM rate in 9 out of the 10 time periods (r = \x960.34 to r = \x960.46, P = 0.044 to P = 0.005). After adjusting for smoking and other confounders, log fish consumption (% of total energy [% E]) was inversely and significantly associated with LCM rate (per 100 000 per year) in all 10 time periods (\xdf = \x9626.3 to \xdf = \x9636.7; P = 0.0039 to P < 0.0001). The stratified analysis showed that this inverse relation was significant only in countries with above median level of smoking (>2437 cigarettes/adult/year) or animal fat minus fish fat consumption (22.4% E). An increase in fish consumption by 1% E was calculated to reduce mean male LCM rate of the populations examined in the age class of 45\x9674 years by 8.4%. In women, no significant relation between fish consumption and LCM could be established.\r\n\r\nConclusions Fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk from LCM, but this possible protective effect is clear-cut only in men and in countries with high levels of cigarette smoking or animal fat consumption'",3
"b""Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a Th1-type cell-mediated autoimmune disease induced by immunization with myelin proteins and mediated by CD4+ T cells. Although susceptibility to EAE is dependent largely on MHC background, the B10.S strain is resistant to induction of EAE despite sharing the I-As MHC locus with the susceptible SJL strain. Furthermore, NOD mice which spontaneously develop diabetes are susceptible to EAE induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35\x9655, whereas a MHC congenic strain, III, which also expresses I-Ag7 MHC haplotype does not develop diabetes and is also resistant to EAE induction. We induced EAE in these four strains of mice with MOG peptides 92\x96106 (for I-As strains) and 35\x9655 (for I-Ag7 strains) in complete Freund's adjuvant. In the susceptible strains (SJL and NOD) in vitro, there are high levels of IFN-{gamma} production, whereas the resistant strains (B10.S or III) secreted primarily IL-4/IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\xdf, and had decreased levels of IFN-{gamma}. When brains from susceptible and resistant mice were examined by immunohistochemical methods for cytokine expression, the brains from resistant mice showed fewer infiltrates which predominantly expressed IL-4 and IL-10 and/or TGF-\xdf. Brains from NOD and SJL with EAE showed mainly IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} positive cells. Thus, resistance to MOG induced EAE in B10.S and III mouse strains is related to non-MHC genes and is associated with an altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines both in lymphoid tissue and in the brain following immunization with myelin antigens.""",4
"b'Identifying the cortical areas activated by illusory contours provides valuable information on the mechanisms of object perception. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the visual areas of the human brain involved in the perception of a moving Kanizsa-type illusory contour. Our results indicate that, in addition to other cortical regions, areas V5 and V1 are activated. Activity in area V1 was particularly prominent.\r\nOne of the essential operations carried out by the visual system is the segmentation of the visual scene into different components. This process requires the identification of borders between different surfaces which may be signaled by differences in luminance, in texture and/or in chrominance. Border perception can also be induced between distant colinear discontinuities that signal the presence of an opaque object with the same optical characteristics as the background (Petry and Meyer, 1987Go). Borders which are perceived in the absence of differences in luminance or chrominance are usually called illusory or subjective contours. One class of illusory contours (Fig. 1aGo) is generated by the alignment of high-contrast borders that act as inducers of the illusory perception of a dark shape placed over a set of white disks (Kanizsa, 1979Go).\r\nIllusory contours have been extensively used to test different hypotheses about how the information is processed within the visual system [extended bibliographies on this topic have been given elsewhere (Purgh\xe9 and Coren, 1992Go; Spillman and Dresp, 1995)]. Illusory contours provide good models, in particular, for investigating the mechanisms involved in perceptual grouping (Marr, 1982Go) and in the segregation of forms and objects from a background (Kojo et al., 1993Go).\r\nOne of the issues currently being debated is the level at which illusory contours are encoded (Gregory, 1972Go; Smith and Over, 1975Go; Rock and Anson, 1979Go; von der Heydt et al., 1984Go; Grosof et al., 1993Go; Shapley, 1994Go; Hirsch et al., 1995Go; Ffytche and Zeki, 1996; Mendola et al., 1999Go). Imaging studies in humans have suggested that static illusory contours activate neuronal populations at the earliest levels of cortical processing. In a positron emission tomography (PET) study, activation was shown mostly in area V2 (Ffytche and Zeki, 1996Go). In one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation, activation of extrastriate areas has been reported with a possible weak participation at the border of areas V1 and V2 (Hirsch et al., 1995Go). In another fMRI study, similar static illusory contours have been shown to induce mainly activation of higher-order organized areas including V3A, V4v, V7 and V8. The activation of low-level areas (V1 and V2) was not, however, ruled out (Mendola et al., 1999Go).\r\n\r\nIt is well known that processing within the visual system occurs along two main pathways, the occipito-temporal ventral stream and the occipito-parietal dorsal stream. Previous studies of cortical activation by illusory contours have used static stimuli which are likely to preferentially trigger neurons of the ventral stream (Hirsch et al., 1995Go; Ffytche and Zeki, 1996Go; Mendola et al., 1999Go).\r\n\r\nMuch less is known concerning the processing of moving illusory contours and the involvement of the dorsal stream. Two imaging studies have focused on the perception of illusory movement during viewing of static stimuli (Zeki et al., 1993Go; Tootell et al., 1995bGo). Strong activation was found within and around area V5, a cortical region known to be important for the perception of motion. In another imaging study, the apparent motion of illusory contours (Ramachandran, 1985Go) has been reported to evoke activation in V5 (Goebel et al. 1998Go).\r\n\r\nIt was therefore of interest to assess whether moving illusory contours mainly activate area V5, as most moving stimuli do, and/or whether they activate areas V1 and V2 as at least some of the static illusory contours do (Hirsch et al., 1995Go; Ffytche and Zeki, 1996Go). Moving illusory contours were generated by means of rotating \x91Pacman\x92 inducers (Bravo et al., 1988Go) configured in such a way that the subject perceives an illusory rectangle moving vertically across the visual field in a saccadic fashion (Fig. 1aGo). Activations were assessed by means of fMRI. Part of this work has previously appeared in abstract form (Seghier et al. 1999Go).\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The somatic marker hypothesis provides a systems-level neuroanatomical and cognitive framework for decision making and the influence on it by emotion. The key idea of this hypothesis is that decision making is a process that is influenced by marker signals that arise in bioregulatory processes, including those that express themselves in emotions and feelings. This influence can occur at multiple levels of operation, some of which occur consciously and some of which occur non-consciously. Here we review studies that confirm various predictions from the hypothesis. The orbitofrontal cortex represents one critical structure in a neural system subserving decision making. Decision making is not mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex alone, but arises from large-scale systems that include other cortical and subcortical components. Such structures include the amygdala, the somatosensory/insular cortices and the peripheral nervous system. Here we focus only on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in decision making and emotional processing, and the relationship between emotion, decision making and other cognitive functions of the frontal lobe, namely working memory.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'This is the last in a series of papers dealing with intracranial event-related potential (ERP) correlates of face perception. Here we describe the results of manipulations that may exert top-down influences on face recognition and face-specific ERPs, and the effects of cortical stimulation at face-specific sites. Ventral facespecific N200 was not evoked by affective stimuli; showed little or no habituation; was not affected by the familiarity or unfamiliarity of faces; showed no semantic priming; and was not affected by face-name learning or identification. P290 and N700 were affected by semantic priming and by face-name learning and identification. The early fraction of N700 and face-specific P350 exhibited significant habituation. About half of the AP350 sites exhibited semantic priming, whereas the VP350 and LP350 sites did not. Cortical stimulation evoked a transient inability to name familiar faces or evoked face-related hallucinations at two-thirds of facespecific N200 sites. These results are discussed in relation to human behavioral studies and monkey single-cell recordings. Discussion of results of all three papers concludes that: face-specific N200 reflects the operation of a module specialized for the perception of human faces; ventral and lateral occipitotemporal cortex are composed of a complex mosaic of functionally discrete patches of cortex of variable number, size and location; in ventral cortex there is a posterior-to-anterior trend in the location of patches in the order letter-strings, form, hands, objects, faces and face parts; P290 and N700 at face-specific N200 sites, and face-specific P350, are subject to top-down influences.'",1
"b""Background A pilot neonatal screening programme revealed a high (approximately 1 per 4800 live births) prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The purpose of this paper was to estimate in a larger prospective study the prevalence of CT in the country.\r\n\r\nMethods At the beginning of the study, an in-house indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used, to be later replaced with a commercial capture IgM fluorometric enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). Both methods detect specific anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgM-class antibodies eluted from dried blood spots.\r\n\r\nResults Of the total of 140 914 samples received from all over the country, 47 cases were identified and confirmed as CT. This finding suggests a prevalence of 1 per 3000 live births. Of the 47 patients, only eight (17%) had clinical manifestations: two had intracranial calcifications, four had retinal scars, one had an intracranial calcification and retinal scars, and one had hepatosplenomegaly with lymphoadenopathy. The testing was paid for by the patients' families who volunteered for the study and gave their informed consent.\r\n\r\nConclusion The 3-year prospective study using sensitive detection methods, reliable confirmation, and feedback from clinicians showed that CT has an extraordinarily high prevalence in Brazil, in fact the highest ever reported in the world. Although the long-term efficacy of treatment of CT has not been well documented, in view of the availability of reliable diagnostics, confirmation and monitoring, functional logistics, and networking for screening, the insidious nature of the sequelae and the very high prevalence of the disease, neonatal screening for CT should be considered an alternative to no screening at all.""",3
"b""[alpha]1,3galactosyltransferase ([alpha]1,3GalT) catalyzes the synthesis of a range of glycoconjugates containing the Gal[alpha]1,3Gal epitope which is recognized by the naturally occurring human antibody, anti-Gal. This enzyme may be a useful synthetic tool to produce a range of compounds to further investigate the binding site of anti-Gal and other proteins with a Gal[alpha]1,3Gal binding site. Thus, the enzyme has been probed with a series of type 2 disaccharide-C8 (Gal[beta]1-4GlcNAc-C8) analogs. The enzyme tolerated acceptors with modifications at C2 and C3 of the N-acetylglucosamine residue, producing a family of compounds with a nonreducing [alpha]1,3 linked galactose. Compounds that did not serve as acceptors were evaluated as inhibitors. Interestingly, the type 1 disaccharide-C8, Gal[beta]1-3GlcNAc-C8, was a good inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki = 270 \xb5M vs. Km = 190 \xb5M for Gal[beta]1-4GlcNAc-C8). A potential photoprobe, based on a modified type 2 disaccharide (octyl 3-amino-3-deoxy-3-N-(2-diazo-3, 3, 3-trifluoropropionyl-[beta]-d-galactopyranosyl-(1,4)-2-acetamindo-2-deoxy-[beta]-d-glycopyranoside, (DTFP-LacNAc-C8)), was evaluated as an inhibitor of [alpha]1,3GalT. [alpha]1,3GalT bound DTFP-LacNAc-C8 with an affinity (Ki = 300 \xb5M) similar to that displayed by the enzyme for LacNAc-C8. Additional studies were done to determine the enzyme's ability to transfer a range of sugars from UDP-sugar donors. The results of these experiments demonstrated that [alpha]1,3GalT has a strict specificity for UDP-Gal. Finally, inactivation studies with various amino acid modifiers were done to obtain information on the importance of different types of amino acids for [alpha]1,3GalT activity.""",2
"b'Ethanol can create progressive neuropathological and functional alterations of neurones. However, the influence of exposure duration is still debated. It is difficult to specify the level of alcohol consumption leading to alcohol-induced brain damage. Moreover, the mechanism of toxicity is assumed to combine direct and metabolically induced effects, although numerous uncertainties remain. Finally, the genotoxic power of ethanol has not fully been investigated in the brain. In the experiment reported herein, primary cultures of neurones were exposed either chronically or acutely to doses of ethanol within the range of blood alcohol levels in intoxicated humans. The impact on the integrity of neurones was assessed by cytotoxicity tests and DNA alterations by single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) and flow cytometry. Chronic ethanol exposure, even at a low dose, was more harmful to neurones than acute exposure. Both significant reductions in cell viability and DNA alterations were observed in this condition. On the other hand, DNA repair capacities seemed to be preserved as long as the viability measured by specific tests was not affected. Instead, neurones entered a death cell process compatible with apoptosis.'",0
"b""To compare the performance of competing and complementary interventions for prevention or treatment of problem drinking and alcohol dependence. To provide an example of how health maximising decision-makers might use performance measures such as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) league tables to formulate an optimal package of interventions for problem drinking and alcohol dependence. Methods: A time-dependent state-transition model was used to estimate QALYs gained per person for each intervention as compared to usual care in the relevant target population. Results: Cost per QALY estimates for each of the interventions fall below any putative funding threshold for developed economies. Interventions for problem drinkers appear to offer better value than interventions targeted at those with a history of severe physical dependence. Conclusions: Formularies such as Australia's Medicare should include a comprehensive package of interventions for problem drinking and alcohol dependence.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Nascent class I molecules have been hypothesized to undergo a conformational change when they bind peptide based on the observation that most available antibodies only detect peptide-loaded class I. Furthermore recent evidence suggests that this peptide-facilitated conformational change induces the release of class I from association with transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)/tapasin and other endoplasmic reticulum proteins facilitating class I assembly. To learn more about the structure of peptide-empty class I, we have studied mAb 64-3-7 that is specific for peptide-empty forms of Ld. We show here that mAb 64-3-7 detects a linear stretch of amino acids including principally residues 48Q and 50P. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 64-3-7 epitope can be transferred to other class I molecules with limited mutagenesis. Interestingly, in the folded class I molecule residues 48 and 50 are on a loop connecting a \xdf strand (under the bound peptide) with the {alpha}1 helix (rising above the ligand binding site). Thus it is attractive to propose that this loop is a hinge region. Importantly, the three-dimensional structure of this loop is strikingly conserved among class I molecules. Thus our findings suggest that all class I molecules undergo a similar conformational change in the loop around residues 48 and 50 when they associate with peptide.'",4
"b'In an international double-blind placebo-controlled trial with 493 detoxified alcohol-dependent individuals, ritanserin, a specific 5-hydroxytryptamine2 antagonist, was tested in three different dosages (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/day) against placebo over a period of 6 months. Data on changes in mood state, sleep quality, morning vigilance, clinical impression, and social functioning were analysed. None of the three dosages of ritanserin given revealed any significant effect against placebo on the above-mentioned parameters either at the end of treatment or upon relapse. Therefore, we conclude that patients suffering from alcohol dependence without concomitant psychiatric disorders do not benefit from additional treatment with (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/day) ritanserin.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'We have examined the distribution of cortical neurons in adult monkey cortex which stain for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d), an enzyme which is involved in the synthesis of nitric oxide. In order to compare distributions across areas we employed a cortical unit defined as the radial column, which refers to the volume of cortex below 1 mm2 of cortical surface. Numbers of labeled neurons per radial column generate areal density measurements either for the full thickness of the cortex or for individual layers. Measurements were made in six cortical regions (areas V1, V2, STS, auditory cortex, area 4 and area 6). NADPH-d stains nonpyramidal neurons which can be divided into two major groups. Type 1 neurons have large soma diameters, stain densely for NADPH-d and show few morphological variations both within and across areas. Type 2 neurons have small somata and short processes, and can be subdivided on the basis of soma size into dense and light staining categories. Both subcategories of type 2 neurons show significant areal variations in size. In each cortical area the majority of type 1 neurons are located in the white matter. Areal densities of type 1 neurons are minimal in areas V1 and V2, and twice as dense in the frontal cortex. Pairwise comparisons of areal densities among the six areas examined show that in a radial column throughout the full thickness of cortex, areas differ significantly from each other in 12/15 comparisons. Consideration of individual layers shows significant differences in 13/15 comparisons. Type 2 neurons are exclusively located in the cortical gray matter, and in all areas are considerably more numerous than type 1 neurons. Area V1 is unique it that it has up to three times the areal density found in any other cortical area. With reference to published laminar cell density counts our results show that the percentage of labeled NADPH-d neurons in individual layers of area V1 are significantly higher than in the other areas. The laminar distributions of type 1 and type 2 neurons show that each area has a unique profile of NADPH-d expression. The modular or columnar organization of the cortex, also referred to as the radial column hypothesis, is important for understanding both the development and function of the cortex. The present results show that radial columns in individual cortical areas possess distinctive patterns of NADPH-d expression. This important degree of areal heterogeneity of NADPH-d neurons has far reaching implications for both the development and functions of neocortical areas.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'CD154\x96CD40 interactions are of central importance for the induction of antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. Since most anti-CD40 mAb are only weak B cell mitogens, it is believed that under physiological conditions, signals through CD40 synergize with those from other receptors on B cells to induce B cell activation. We show here that the interaction of either normal B cells, or those from CBA/N (xid) mice, with CD3-activated primary T cells in whole spleen cell cultures markedly reduces the threshold for B cell activation via CD40. Hence, these pre-activated cells undergo vigorous proliferation when stimulated with either optimal or suboptimal concentrations of weakly mitogenic anti-CD40 mAb, or with soluble CD40 ligand. Blocking experiments indicate that the establishment of this priming effect requires stimulation via CD40 itself, plus T cell-derived IL-2. In support of this concept, only CD3/CD28-pre-activated, but not CD3-pre-activated T cells induce this effect, unless the co-cultures of B cells with the latter T cells are supplemented with IL-2. Although B cells activated in this fashion do express higher levels of CD40 than naive cells, we believe that this is insufficient to explain the observed dramatic effects on their proliferative capacity. Rather we propose that T cell-dependent B cell activation induces fundamental changes in the signalling machinery invoked by ligation of CD40. It is likely that this amplification loop could play an important role during the initiation of antibody responses to T-dependent antigens, when activated CD4 T cells only express low levels of CD154.'",4
b'The progression of polymerases across the \xb5\x96{delta} Ig heavy chain gene complex is characterized by two termination events occurring at different sites on the transcription unit and at different times during B cell differentiation. We have utilized two mouse strains to analyze the regulatory determinants for these events in primary B cells. In the transgenic p\xb5.\xb5{delta}Ratt strain a 1160 bp intervening DNA segment (the att site) has been inverted. This mutation results in the abrogation of transcription termination that occurs in early B cells. Using a novel method that takes advantage of an internal ribosome entry site we have further restricted the size of the segment that is needed for inducing transcription termination in transfectants. This 200 bp termination-inducing sequence operates in tumor equivalents of early but not mature B cells and the activity is correlated with differential binding of nuclear proteins. To explore the regulatory basis for the change in site of transcription termination upon B cell activation we have examined the \xb5S\x96/\x96 deletion mutant strain in which the \xb5S poly(A) site has been eliminated. The results suggest that polyadenylation at the \xb5S site plays a dominant but not exclusive role in regulating transcription termination in activated B cells.',4
"b'This study quantified the magnitude and timing of selective attention effects across areas of the macaque visual system, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), lower cortical areas V1 and V2, and multiple higher visual areas in the dorsal and ventral processing streams. We used one stimulus configuration and behavioral paradigm, with simultaneous recordings from different areas to allow direct comparison of the distribution and timing of attention effects across the system. Streams of interdigitated auditory and visual stimuli were presented at a high rate with an irregular interstimulus interval (mean of 4/s). Attention to visual stimuli was manipulated by requiring subjects to make discriminative behavioral responses to stimuli in one sensory modality, ignoring all stimuli in the other. The attended modality was alternated across trial blocks, and difficulty of discrimination was equated across modalities. Stimulus presentation was gated, so that no stimuli were presented unless the subject gazed at the center of the visual stimulus display. Visual stimuli were diffuse light flashes differing in intensity or color and subtending 12\xb0 centered at the point of gaze. Laminar event-related potential (ERP) and current source density (CSD) response profiles were sampled during multiple paired penetrations in multiple visual areas with linear array multicontact electrodes. Attention effects were assessed by comparing responses to specific visual stimuli when attended versus when visual stimuli were looked at the same way, but ignored. Effects were quantified by computing a modulation index (MI), a ratio of the differential CSD response produced by attention to the sum responses to attended and ignored visual stimuli. The average MI increased up levels of the lower visual pathways from none in the LGN to 0.0278 in V1 to 0.101 in V2 to 0.170 in V4. Above the V2 level, attention effects were larger in ventral stream areas (MI = 0.152) than in dorsal stream areas (MI = 0.052). Although onset latencies were shortest in dorsal stream areas, attentional modulation of the early response was small relative to the stimulus-evoked response. Higher ventral stream areas showed substantial attention effects at the earliest poststimulus time points, followed by the lower visual areas V2 and V1. In all areas, attentional modulation lagged the onset of the stimulus-evoked response, and attention effects grew over the time course of the neuronal response. The most powerful, consistent, and earliest attention effects were those found to occur in area V4, during the 100\x96300 ms poststimulus interval. Smaller effects occurred in V2 over the same interval, and the bulk of attention effects in V1 were later. In the accompanying paper, we describe the physiology of attention effects in V1, V2 and V4.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'The thymus is the major site of selection and differentiation of T cells in mammals and birds. To begin to study the evolution of thymocyte differentiation, we have developed, in the frog Xenopus, an in vitro system that takes advantage of cortical thymocyte antigen (CTX), a recently discovered T cell antigen whose expression is restricted to Xenopus cortical thymocytes. Upon transient stimulation with suboptimal mitogenic concentrations of the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin, Xenopus thymocytes are induced to differentiate into cycling T lymphoblasts that actively synthesize and express high levels of surface MHC class I and class II molecules. This appearance of T lymphoblasts correlates with a rapid down-regulation of both surface CTX protein and CTX mRNA. A thymocyte subset with an immature phenotype (CTX+, CD8+, class II\x96 or class IIlow and class I\x96) was characterized by depleting class II+ cells or by panning with anti-CTX mAb. This immature CTX+ thymocyte subset displays a limited proliferative capacity compared to total, class II+ or to CTX\x96 thymocytes, and can be induced, by PMA/ionomycin, to differentiate into more mature T lymphoblasts expressing surface class II and class I molecules. These results provide the first in vitro evidence in an ectothermic vertebrate of a conserved intrathymic pathway of thymocyte differentiation. In addition, our data reveal that CTX can serve as a differentiation surface marker of a population of immature thymocytes that appears to be the equivalent of the mammalian CD4/CD8 double-positive subset.'",4
"b""Background Studies have found that reproductive factors might have a variable effect on the occurrence of breast cancer (BC) according to the existence or not of a family history of BC. The effect of a family history of BC on the risk of BC may also vary according to the age at diagnosis and the degree of kinship. This may confound the relation between familial risk and reproductive factors. A combined analysis was performed to study the interaction between familial risk and reproductive factors according to degree of familiality, age at interview and menopausal status.\r\n\r\nMethods The present analysis included 2948 cases and 4170 controls in seven case-control studies from four countries. The combined relative risks were estimated using a Bayesian random-effects logistic regression model.\r\n\r\nResults The main effects of reproductive life factors on the risk of BC are in agreement with previous studies. Two-way interactions between subject's age or menopausal status and a family history of BC were not significant. Although the three-way interaction between age, familial risk and parity was not significant, familial risk seemed to be increased slightly for women with high parity compared with women with low parity in the older age group, and seemed to be slightly decreased for women with high parity compared with women with low parity in younger women. The subject's age also appeared to have an effect on the interaction between familial risk and the age at first childbirth (P = 0.1).\r\n\r\nConclusions A possible influence of reproductive and menstrual factors on familial risk of BC has been suggested previously and was also evident in the present study. Three-way interactions between age, family history and parity or age at first childbirth might exist and they merit further investigation.""",3
"b'This study used a novel approach to examine a much studied question, the nature of visual deficits caused by lesions of the inferotemporal cortex (IT). Unlike many previous studies of IT lesions, we de-emphasized early, non-specific disruptions of testing caused by the lesions, and instead concentrated on permanent changes in thresholds. This approach produced unexpected results that suggest a re-evaluation of the traditional view of the role of the IT cortex in shape perception and such related visual abilities as perceptual invariances, visual grouping, the visibility of illusory contours and the performance of oddity discriminations. In addition, the measurement of stable, post-lesion hue discrimination thresholds gave us a different perspective on the severity of color vision deficits which result from lesions of the IT cortex. We found that shape distortion thresholds were not permanently elevated by IT lesions and, indeed, showed no greater transitory disruption than did other visual abilities. This result is inconsistent with the common view that IT is critical to shape discriminations. Two other visual abilities that would be expected to be disrupted by IT lesions \x97 the visual grouping of misoriented line segments and shape invariances (failure of irrelevant stimulus changes to disrupt shape distortion thresholds) \x97 were not affected by IT lesions. However, shape discriminations based on illusory contours and some oddity discriminations were severely and permanently affected. Our results also showed that IT lesions caused permanent, moderate to large impairments of color vision, but not color blindness. Bilateral damage to area TEO caused no disruption of performance on any of the abovediscriminations. Our results suggest that the IT cortex in macaques may be critical to the visibility of illusory contours and the performance of some oddity discriminations, that it plays some role in color perception, but that it is not essential for shape, grouping discriminations or perceptual shape invariances.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b""To compare the effect of an antagonist of the mGlu5 glutamate receptor, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) on a test for anxiety and on the volitional consumption of ethanol. Methods: The test for anxiety was placement of a Sprague-Dawley rat for a 5 min observation period in an elevated plus-maze. Volitional consumption of ethanol in a two-choice paradigm was determined for male and female myers high ethanol-preferring rats after a 10-day \x91step-up\x92 test of 3\x9630% v/v ethanol vs water used to determine each rat's preferred concentration of ethanol. Each rat received a 4-day baseline period, 3-days of drug injection b.i.d., and a 4-day post-treatment period and then rotated to a different dose of drug or vehicle. Results: The effects of MPEP on elevated plus-maze activity were not significant at doses up to 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneously 60 min. before observation. There was a dose-dependent, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg, decrease in consumption of preferred concentrations of ethanol, along with a decrease in the proportion of ethanol consumed to total fluids consumed. The 3.0 mg/kg b.i.d. dose of MPEP reduced consumption by 57%, proportion by 45%, and food intake by 10%. Conclusions: MPEP did not appear to have an anti-anxiety effect, but volitional drinking in a genetic model was reduced.

"b'Experimental studies have revealed conspicuous short-term facilitation and depression that are expressed differentially at distinct classes of cortical synapses. To explore computational implications of synaptic dynamics, we investigated transmission of complex spike trains through a stochastic model of cortical synapse endowed with short-term facilitation and vesicle depletion. Inputs to the synapse model were either real spike train data recorded from the visual and prefrontal cortices of behaving monkeys, or were generated numerically with prescribed temporal statistics. We tested the hypothesis that short-term facilitation could enable synapses to filter out single spikes and favor bursts of action potentials. We found that the ratio between release probabilities for a burst spike and an isolated spike grows monotonically with increasing number of spikes per burst, and with increasing interval between isolated spikes. Burst detection is optimal when the facilitation time constant matches the average burst duration. Using fractal-like spike patterns characterized by long-term power-law temporal correlations and similar to those seen in sensory neurons, we found that facilitation increases correlation at short time scales. In contrast, depression leads to a dramatic reduction in temporal correlations at all time scales, and to a flat (\x91whitened\x92) power spectrum, thereby decorrelating natural input signals.'",1

"b'The selective migration of functional Th lymphocyte subsets with different cytokine production profiles into inflamed tissue is likely to depend on the state of activation of the cells, as well as on the differential expression of various adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of allergen-specific activation on the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on T lymphocytes. We show that stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic patients with the allergen Der p results in down-regulation of CXCR4 surface expression on Der p-activated CD25+CD45RO+ antigen-specific memory cells which was caused by a decrease in CXCR4 gene transcription and did not seem to be mediated by endogenous cytokines, such as IFN-{gamma}. In contrast, however, CXCR4 surface expression was enhanced on naive CD25\x96CD45RO\x96 and resting CD25\x96CD45RO+ memory T cells, as a result of the presence of endogenous IL-4, most likely produced by Der p-activated memory T cells. Antigen-specific CD25+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes, purified 7 days after stimulation with Der p, had a strongly reduced capacity to migrate in response to stimulation with stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, the ligand for CXCR4. Together, these results suggest that differential expression of CXCR4 on activated and resting T cells is due to the counteracting effects of TCR-mediated down-regulation and IL-4-mediated up-regulation of this chemokine receptor respectively, and furthermore indicate that antigen-activated memory T cells are unlikely to migrate into inflamed tissue in response to SDF-1.'",4
"b'We have recently described the novel A6H antigen expressed on human peripheral blood T cells and on renal cell carcinoma cells. Cross-linking of the A6H antigen results in co-stimulation of human CD4+ T cells, characterized by induction of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), proliferation and prominent IFN-{gamma} production, but low levels of IL-2. The proximal signaling events associated with A6H ligation include protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and association of p56 Lck, ZAP-70 and the TCR {zeta} chain. In this study we show that A6H co-stimulation selectively induced activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, whereas no significant c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) activity was observed. In contrast, CD28 co-stimulation resulted in both p38 and JNK MAPK activities. Human CD4+ T cells co-stimulated with A6H up-regulated AP-1 binding proteins reactive with a proximal AP-1 binding site in the human IFN-{gamma} promoter and a consensus AP-1 binding site. Moreover, preincubation of the T cells with the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 resulted in decreased AP-1 binding following A6H or CD28 co-stimulation. This suggests that the p38 MAPK pathway is required for induction of full AP-1 binding activity in human CD4+ T cells co-stimulated with A6H or CD28. Blocking the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 completely inhibited IFN-{gamma} production from A6H co-stimulated T cells and radically reduced IFN-{gamma} production from T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD28. In contrast, no significant inhibition of IL-2 production was seen after blocking of the p38 MAPK in either A6H or CD28 co-stimulated T cells. Since the p38 MAPK recently has been shown to be critically involved in regulation of IFN-{gamma} production from Th1 cells, we propose that A6H co-stimulation induces a specific pathway, mediated via p38 and AP-1 activation, for induction of a Th1 profile in human CD4+ T cells.'",4
"b'The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between negative life events and chronic stressors and drinking behaviour. Data suggested that some life events (getting divorced) and some chronic stressors (financial difficulties, unfavourable marital status, and unfavourable employment status) were positively related to abstinence among men and women. Furthermore, some life events (being a victim of a crime, decrease in financial position, divorce or reporting two or more life events) were positively associated with heavy drinking among men. Chronic stressors, such as unfavourable marital status and unfavourable employment status, were also related to heavy drinking among both men and women. Results presented here suggest that people under stressful conditions are more likely to either abstain or drink heavily rather than to drink lightly or moderately.'",0
"b""Background In the last two decades reports from different countries emerged associating pesticide and herbicide use with Parkinson's disease (PD). California growers use approximately 250 million pounds of pesticides annually, about a quarter of all pesticides used in the US.\r\n\r\nMethods We employed a proportional odds mortality design to compare all cases of PD recorded as underlying (1984\x961994) or associated causes (1984\x961993) of death occurring in California with all deaths from ischaemic heart disease (ICD-9 410\x96 414) during the same period. Based on pesticide use report data we classified California counties into several pesticide use categories. Agricultural census data allowed us to create measures of percentage of land per county treated with pesticides. Employing logistic regression models we estimated the effect of pesticide use controlling for age, gender, race, birthplace, year of deaths, and education.\r\n\r\nResults Mortality from PD as the underlying cause of death was higher in agricultural pesticide-use counties than in non-use counties. A dose response was observed for insecticide use per county land treated when using 1982 agricultural census data, but not for amounts of restricted pesticides used or length of residency in a country prior to death.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our data show an increased PD mortality in California counties using agricultural pesticides. Unless all of our measures of county pesticide use are surrogates for other risk factors more prevalent in pesticide use counties, it seems important to target this prevalent exposure in rural California in future studies that use improved case finding mechanisms and collect pesticide exposure data for individuals.""",3
"b'We identified functionally polarized subsets of CD4 memory T cells on the basis of the expression of CD11a, CD45RA and CD62L. Within the several phenotypically distinct subsets of CD4 memory cells are two that, upon stimulation, produce primarily IL-4 (MT2, CD45RA\x96CD62L+CD11adim) or primarily IFN-{gamma} (MT1, CD45RA\x96CD62L\x96CD11abright). In addition, four other phenotypically distinct subsets of CD4 cells have unique cytokine profiles. To determine the clinical relevance of the representation of these cell types, we analyzed blood from patients with the chronic diseases leprosy and atopy. These diseases are characterized as immunologically polarized, since T cell responses in affected individuals are often strongly biased towards Th1 (dominated by IFN-{gamma} production) or Th2 (IL-4 production). We show here that this polarization reflects homeostatic or differentiation mechanisms affecting the representation of the functionally distinct subsets of memory CD4 T cells, MT1 and MT2. Significantly, the representation of the MT1 and MT2 subsets differs dramatically between subjects with tuberculoid leprosy (a Th1 disease), or lepromatous leprosy or atopic disease (Th2 diseases). However, there was no difference in the cytokine profiles of these or any of the other finely resolved CD4 subsets, when compared between individuals across all disease states. Thus, it is the representation of these subsets in peripheral blood that is diagnostic of the polarized state of the immune system'",4
"b'Background At the present time, in Brazil and other countries in the Americas, the only cases of paralytic poliomyelitis due to poliovirus are caused by vaccine strains. The recognition of possible determinants of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) by public health surveillance and immunization programmes is relevant to inform the debate on criteria for case definition and vaccination strategies.\r\n\r\nMethods A retrospective cohort study based on the cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) was designed, with the objective of studying cases of VAPP in Brazil between 1989 and 1995. Clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data from 3656 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, 30 of them diagnosed as VAPP, were analysed.\r\n\r\nResults An 8.88 risk ratio of VAPP (95% CI : 4.37\x9618.03) was found when comparing individuals who received oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) between 4 and 40 days before the onset of paralysis and individuals who did not receive the vaccine within this period. A risk of 1 case/2.39 million first doses and 1 case/13.03 million OPV doses administered was estimated for the general population.\r\n\r\nConclusions Cases of AFP who received OPV between 4 and 40 days before the onset of paralysis and had fever, a prodrome of gastrointestinal symptoms, history of first dose of OPV, isolation of vaccine poliovirus type 2, and young age deserve careful investigation, since they are at increased risk for the condition studied.'",3
"b'Although the neocortex has been considered to be highly resistant to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), we have recently shown that spaced and repeated stimulation of white matter afferents reliably induces neocortical LTP in the freely moving rat. The following study examined the effects of maximal electroconvulsive shock (MES) stimulation on the induction of LTP in the chronically prepared rat. MES stimulation was applied at different intervals following LTP-inducing trains over a 10 day period. High-frequency LTP-inducing stimulation resulted in amplitude changes in both early (9.28 ms to peak) and late (20.81 ms to peak) components of the evoked EPSP, as well as of the population spikes. There was a window of time following high-frequency stimulation within which MES could interrupt the induction of LTP. MES stimulation applied immediately, or 1 h after, LTP-inducing trains prevented the induction of LTP. LTP was not blocked, however, when the MES stimulation was applied 6 h after the LTP-inducing trains. MES stimulation applied to a fully potentiated animal transiently attenuated both the population spike and polysynaptic measures, but both components recovered within 24 h. These data support the idea of a consolidation gradient for neocortical LTP similar to that seen in behavioural studies.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Some scientists remain wary of evolutionary theory because of its supposed genetic determinism and insensitivity to the inequalities often associated with gender, race and class. Our aim is to show that such fears are outdated and to foster a role for evolutionary theory in public health. We use complex adaptive systems theory and the concept of a tradeoff between current and future reproduction to argue that when the future is objectively risky and uncertain the optimal reproductive strategy will often be to reproduce at a young age and/or high rate. Because reproducing early and/or often can lead to ill health and shortened lives, and because inequality is a major source of environmental risk and uncertainty, we argue that any attempt to use evolutionary theory to understand human reproduction, health or wellbeing must include considerations of inequality and social capital'",3
"b""The deleterious effects of maternal ethanol consumption on neonatal immune development and early immune responses has been well documented. However, the effects of such neonatal exposure to maternally consumed ethanol on the neonates' immune responses in their adult life, especially in combination with additional ethanol exposure, has received little attention. For these experiments, female rats were fed on either 6% ethanol or pair-fed isocaloric control Lieber\x96DeCarli liquid diets for 30 days prior to, and during, pregnancy and lactation. One day after weaning their pups, the mothers were infected with 1000 Trichinella spiralis larvae, and maintained on diets for an additional 20 days. At this time, they were challenged with 2000 T. spiralis larvae, killed 3 days later, and their immune status determined. These animals served as the first generation alcohol animals. Their female offspring served as the experimental second generation animals. These animals received maternal ethanol during pregnancy and lactation and control diet during their juvenile period (from weaning to 90 days of age). They were then subjected to a schedule of ethanol or pairfeeding, identical to the first generation dams. Two groups of second generation animals were established: Group 1 was exposed to ethanol during their dam's pregnancy and lactation periods only, with no subsequent ethanol treatment; Group 2 received ethanol during their dam's pregnancy and lactation periods and then again throughout their adult experimental period. Our previous studies showed only minimal changes following a secondary challenge in T. spiralis-immunized rats; however, neonates born to alcohol-consuming mothers did show some depressed secondary immune responses when challenged soon after weaning. We chose to use a secondary immune challenge to assess further immune alterations in second generation adult animals. No differences between any of the ethanol and pair-fed groups were observed in intestinal worm burdens, which is similar to data previously reported for adult alcohol-consuming animals. However, second generation group 2 animals demonstrated significantly reduced proliferation responses to T. spiralis antigen and Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation relative to the ethanol first generation and to the second generation Group 1 animals. This group also demonstrated significantly lower absorbencies in the ELISA assay for specific IgM and IgG anti-T. spiralis antibodies than the pair-fed, ethanol first and second generation Group 1 animals. The proportion of total T cells and cytotoxic T cells was significantly lower and the proportion of natural killer cells was elevated in both second generation ethanol Groups 1 and 2 relative to the ethanol first generation and pair-fed groups. In addition, Group 2 second generation animals showed significantly lower proportions of total leukocytes and T cells than Group 1 second generation animals. Although secondary immune responses to T. spiralis infection were not altered in rats exposed to ethanol only as adults, exposure to maternal ethanol does affect some specific immune responses in second generation adult life and maternal exposure may exert cumulative immune effects in concert with later consumption of ethanol by offspring born to alcoholic mothers.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Alloreactivity, the capacity of a large number of T lymphocytes to react with foreign MHC molecules, represents the cellular basis for the rejection of tissue grafts. Although it was originally assumed that the TCR of alloreactive T cells focus their recognition on the polymorphic residues that differ between the MHC molecules of responder and stimulator cells, studies in the MHC class I system have clearly demonstrated that MHC-bound peptides can influence this interaction. It remains unclear, however, whether peptides play an equally important role for the recognition of MHC class II molecules by alloreactive CD4+ T cells. Another issue that remains unresolved is the overall frequency of peptide-dependent versus peptide-independent alloreactive T cells. We have addressed these questions with antigen-presenting cells (APC) from H2-M mutant mice that predominantly express a single MHC class II\x96peptide complex, H2-Ab bound by a peptide (CLIP) derived from the class II-associated invariant chain. APC from these mice were used as targets and stimulators for alloreactive CD4+ T cells. Results demonstrated that the vast majority of CD4+ alloreactive T cells recognize MHC class II molecules in a peptide-dependent fashion'",4
"b'Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) use mannose receptor (MR)-mediated endocytosis for efficient antigen capture and targeting to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Active biosynthesis of the MR takes place in such cells. We now report that a substantial percentage (up to 20%) of these newly synthesized MR are secreted into the culture medium. The secretion of the soluble MR (sMR) was found to be proportional to the rate of synthesis. The addition of the inflammatory mediator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to DC, known to induce maturation, strongly reduced MR synthesis, expression and shedding of the MR. The sMR is ~10 kDa smaller than the membrane-bound form, but contains an intact N-terminus, indicating the lack of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane region. The sMR appeared to be directly generated from the cell-bound form, indicative of proteolytic cleavage. Importantly, the sMR has maintained its mannose-binding properties since it was capable of binding a mannosylated ligand. The high amount of sMR released by DC and its ability to bind mannosylated ligand might indicate that this molecule plays a role in the transport of mannosylated proteins from the site of inflammation to other parts of the body. Whether that contributes to the generation of immune responses remains to be determined.'",4
"b'The carbohydrate composition of apolipoprotein (apo) B100, particularly its degree of sialylation, may contribute to the atherogenic properties of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). We analyzed LDL apoB100 glycans derived from normolipidemic, hypercholesterolemic, and hypertriglyceridemic diabetic subjects. Using exoglycosidase carbohydrate sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to analyze fluorescently labeled oligosaccharides, we report evidence for several carbohydrates not previously identified on apoB100, including truncated complex biantennary N-glycans and hybrid N-glycans. The distribution and diversity of the apoB100 glycans isolated from all individuals was highly conserved. The N-glycan composition of apoB100 derived from five LDL subpopulations (LDL1, d = 1.018\x961.023; LDL2, d = 1.023\x961.030; LDL3, d = 1.030\x961.040; LDL4, d = 1.040\x961.051; LDL5, d = 1.051\x961.065 g/ml) did not vary in normolipidemic or hypercholesterolemic subjects. Furthermore, we found no evidence for ""desialylated"" apoB100 glycans in any of the samples analyzed. Analysis of the most abundant LDL ganglioside, {alpha}-N-acetylneuraminyllactosyl-ceramide, revealed a deficiency in small dense LDL and in the most buoyant subpopulation. These data provide a novel explanation for the apparent deficiency of sialic acid in small dense LDL and indicate that the global apoB100 N-glycan composition is invariable in the patient groups studied.'",2
"b""A large number of genes have been isolated in the last few years that seem to be involved in the processes of induction, specification and regionalization of the brain. The generation of mouse mutant models for such genes has provided a powerful tool of analysis into their in-vivo properties. Among these genes, Otx1 and Otx2 play a crucial role in several processes of brain morphogenesis. Otx2 is required in the early specification of the neuroectoderm destined to become the fore-midbrain, Otx1 is required mainly for correct corticogenesis, and both genes co-operate in patterning the developing brain through a gene-dosage dependent mechanism. Furthermore, an extensive functional equivalence occurs between the mammalian Otx genes and their Drosophila homolog, orthodenticle. This appears particularly fascinating when considering the huge differences between the brains of mice and flies. This review deals with the major aspects related to the involvement of Otx1 and Otx2 in the development of the mammalian brain and, in particular, of the cerebral cortex.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral cortex, seat of the most sophisticated perceptual and cognitive functions, is a layered structure composed of a great variety of differentiated cells originating in the forebrain from a simple neuroepithelium. The complex and ordered array in functionally distinct cytoarchitectonic areas is the consequence of different genetic programs controlling division, migration and functional integration of neural cells during corticogenesis (Rakic, 1972Go, 1988Go; Chenn and McConnell, 1995Go; McConnell, 1995Go).\r\n\r\nNeocortical areas, unlike other neural structures such as the hindbrain, the diencephalon or the basal telencephalon (Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993Go; Rubenstein et al., 1994Go; Lumsden and Krumlauf, 1996Go), do not appear to be determined as compartments defined by anatomical and/or molecular boundaries but rather show a broad developmental potential. Experiments have shown that cell mixing between different cortical regions can occur (O'Rourke et al., 1992Go) and that fetal neocortical neurons transplanted ectopically can generate axonal connections appropriate for their new position (Schlaggar and O'Leary, 1991Go). Nevertheless, at least some features in the cortex are specified early in development (Cohen-Tannoudji et al., 1994Go; Bulfone et al., 1995Go). Epigenetic interactions may act to distinguish further the identity of the cortical areas.\r\n\r\nRecently, a number of regulatory genes have been identified that may be involved both in the earliest phases of brain development and, later, in corticogenesis.\r\n\r\nMany of these genes have been extensively studied, including members of the families Emx (Simeone et al., 1992bGo; Yoshida et al., 1997Go), Otx (Simeone, 1998Go), Pax (Stoykova and Gruss, 1994Go), Dlx (Bulfone et al., 1993Go) and POU (He et al., 1989Go) and the genes Id-2 (Neuman et al., 1993Go), BF-1 (Xuan et al., 1995Go), Gli-3 (Franz, 1994Go) and T-Brain-1 (Bulfone et al., 1995Go).\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the expression patterns of these genes made it possible to subdivide the embryonic forebrain into molecularly distinct domains (prosomeres) (Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993Go) and in some of them, to identify layer-specific expression within the cortex (Frantz et al., 1994aGo, 1994bGo; Bulfone et al., 1995Go).\r\n\r\nLike many of the cited genes, the Otx genes (Otx1 and Otx2) represent the vertebrate homologues of a Drosophila gene, namely orthodenticle (Finkelstein et al., 1990Go), whose absence in the fly causes the loss of anterior head structures (Hirth et al., 1995Go).\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'The functional organization of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a central issue in cognitive neuroscience. Previous physiological investigations have often failed to reveal specialization within the PFC. However, these studies have generally not been designed to examine this issue. Methodological issues such as statistical criteria for specificity, the number of neurons sampled, the extent of cortex sampled, and the number, location and nature of the stimuli used are among the variables that need to be considered in evaluating the results of studies on functional localization. In the present study, we have examined neurons in macaque monkeys trained to fixate while viewing visual stimuli, including faces, or to use them as memoranda on a working memory task. Visual responses of over 1500 neurons were recorded throughout a wide expanse of the PFC (areas 12, 9, 46, 8 and 45). Neurons were considered selective for faces if the best response to a face was over twice as strong as that to any of a wide variety of non-face stimuli. Full electrode track reconstructions in three monkeys revealed in each that neurons which met this criterion were concentrated almost exclusively in three distinct subregions within the projection region of the temporal lobe visual areas. We further show that for all neurons, the most visually selective neurons (for faces, objects or color patterns) were also the most concentrated in the temporal lobe recipient PFC. Similar face selectivity, regional specialization, and delay or delay-like activity were observed in monkeys whether trained on memory tasks or not, which suggests that these are naturally occurring properties of prefrontal neurons. These results confirm neuronal and regional specialization for information processing in PFC and elucidate how heretofore unexamined experimental variables have a strong influence on the detection of regional specialization.'",1
"b'Background Seasonal patterns in mortality have been recognized for many years. This study assesses seasonal variation in mortality in Scotland between 1981 and 1993 and considers its association with socioeconomic status and outdoor temperature.\r\n\r\nMethods Lagged Poisson regression analysis of numbers of deaths and average weekly temperature with adjustment for serial autocorrelation and influenza epidemics.\r\n\r\nResults There was significant seasonal variation in weekly death rates with a difference of about 30% between a summer trough and a winter peak. This variation was principally attributable to respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease. Seasonal variation in mortality fell from around 38% in 1981\x96 1983 to around 26% in 1991\x961993. There was no clear evidence of a relationship between socioeconomic status and seasonal mortality, however the extent of the fall in seasonal variation was greater in deprived areas than in affluent areas. Overall, a 1\xb0C decrease in mean temperature was associated with a 1% increase in deaths one week later. The lag in this relationship varied by cause of death and underlying temperature.\r\n\r\nConclusions Seasonal variations in mortality and the relationship between temperature and mortality are a significant public health problem in Scotland. It is likely that the strength of this relationship is a result of the population being unable to protect themselves adequately from the effects of temperature rather than the effects of temperature itself.'",3
"b'Because alcoholism is a multi-factorial psychiatric disorder, with both psychosocial and biochemical/genetic factors leading to its manifestation in any one individual, the presence of biochemical/ genetic factors alone may not lead to the manifestation of the disorder. There are numerous difficulties associated with identification of a trait abnormality in a disorder that requires suitable socio-cultural permissiveness with distinct behavioural characteristics to manifest a disorder that may not require that predisposing trait abnormality in order to develop. Numerous studies have been performed in the past to potentially identify a biochemical or genetic trait abnormality in alcoholism, and not all of them have addressed significant methodological flaws in this type of research. This review addresses some of the difficulties inherent in this research, and aims for a comprehensive review of the highlights of the search for a clinically useful trait abnormality. Some series of investigations hold promise that a trait marker for a particular subset of alcoholics may be developed, e.g. severe alcoholism and the dopamine D2 receptor gene; the level of reaction to alcoholism in family history-positive alcoholics; \xdf-endorphin abnormalities in specific family groups of alcoholics; reduced P3 wave event-related potentials as markers and predictors of development of substance abuse in predisposed youths; reduced growth hormone response to apomorphine as a predictor of relapse to alcoholism in early abstinence; abnormal adenylyl cyclase activity in certain defined subgroups of alcoholics; and abnormal platelet monoamine oxidase levels in subjects with a behavioural predisposition to addictive disorders. The review concludes that while there has not yet been an identification of a comprehensive trait marker for alcoholism, there is hope for identification subgroups of alcoholics with consistent biological markers within that subgroup that may well prove fruitful over time. It will then be up to a future generation of clinicians to take that information and develop prevention programmes that can incorporate this information to help the predisposed individual avoid alcohol problems.'",0

The day hospital group overlapped in severity with the home group and 78% completed detoxification. At 60 days, 45% of home detoxification patients and 31% of the day hospital group showed significant improvements in a range of alcohol-related difficulties.

"b'Alcohol is an important determinant of the overall burden of disease in Eastern Europe. It is a particularly important problem in Hungary, where death rates from cirrhosis have increased rapidly to levels much higher than in neighbouring countries. This study sought to describe the prevalence of problem drinking among the hospitalized population in Hungary by means of a survey of self-reported alcohol consumption and of the prevalence of current or lifetime problem drinking among hospitalized patients in the four teaching hospitals in Hungary. A survey was conducted of all patients (n = 3140) admitted to medical, surgical, trauma, psychiatric and neurological wards over a 2-week period in 1997 who stayed in hospital for at least 24 h, using a survey instrument based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Luebeck Alcoholism Screening Test (LAST) instruments designed to screen for current and lifetime problem drinking respectively. In all, 23.5% of men and over 53.5% of women reported never drinking alcohol. Of those who did drink, about one in eight men and less than 1% of women reported drinking 5 or more drinks on a day when they drank. Whether defined by LAST or AUDIT, the prevalence of problem drinking was ~19% among men and 2% among women, although this rose to 32\x9635% among men aged 35\x9644 years. The rate did not vary significantly with employment or education, but was higher among those who were divorced.

"b'Background Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) have been a major environmental health concern because of their wide distribution and persistence in the environment. Estimating joint effects of all congeners in a single analysis is complicated by correlation among exposure levels, and the resulting collinearity makes the results difficult to interpret.\r\n\r\nMethods Patients with breast-related surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, and breast adipose tissue samples were analysed for nine PCB congeners (74, 118, 138, 153, 156, 170, 180, 183, 187). The study recruited 490 women (304 cases and 186 controls) between 1994 and 1997. Logistic ridge regression was used to analyse the instability caused by collinearity.\r\n\r\nResults Although total PCB did not appear to be associated with breast cancer risk, significant differences in effect were observed among the nine congeners. Logistic ridge regression demonstrated a protective effect on breast cancer risk for a potentially anti-oestrogenic and dioxin-like congener, 156, while two phenobarbital, CYP1A and CYP2B inducers had an adverse effect, 180 and 183. This analysis also suggested that a protective effect for another phenobarbital congener, 153, was largely explained by instability caused by collinearity.\r\n\r\nConclusions These results indicate that studies of PCB congeners and health require an in-depth statistical analysis in order to better understand the complex issues related to their collinearity.'",3
"b'Long-term deprivation of visual input for several days or weeks leads to marked changes in the excitability and function of the occipital cortex. The time course of these changes is poorly understood. In this study, we addressed the question whether a short period of light deprivation (minutes to a few hours) can elicit such changes in humans. Noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human occipital cortex can evoke the perception of flashes or spots of light (phosphenes). To assess changes in visual cortex excitability following light deprivation, we measured the minimum intensity of stimulation required to elicit phosphenes (phosphene threshold) and the number of phosphenes elicited by different TMS stimulus intensities (stimulus\x96response curves). A reduced phosphene threshold was detected 45 min after the onset of light deprivation and persisted for the entire deprivation period (180 min). Following re-exposure to light, phosphene thresholds returned to pre- deprivation values over 120 min. Stimulus\x96response curves were significantly enhanced in association with this intervention. In a second experiment, we studied the effects of light deprivation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals elicited by photic stimulation. fMRI results showed increased visual cortex activation after 60 min of light deprivation that persisted following 30 min of re-exposure to light. Our results demonstrated a substantial increase in visual cortex excitability. These changes may underlie behavioral gains reported in humans and animals associated with light deprivation.'",1
"b""CD40 signaling induces B cell proliferative and differentiation responses that can be modulated by many different cytokines. Cytokines in the IL-2 receptor {gamma} chain ({gamma}c)-common family are known to play an integral role in B cell development. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that CD40 signaling induced B cell responsiveness to multiple {gamma}c-common cytokines and that individual {gamma}c-common cytokines induced distinct B cell responses. B cells were isolated from lymphoid follicles of sheep Peyer's patches (PP) and co-cultured with murine CD40 ligand (mCD40L). CD40 signaling induced PP B cell responsiveness to recombinant human IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-15. mCD40L-induced B cell growth was enhanced by combining IL-4 with a second {gamma}c-common cytokine and sustained B cell growth required co-stimulation with IL-4 plus IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15. {gamma}c-common cytokine responsiveness remained dependent upon CD40 signaling, and removal of mCD40L resulted in B cell differentiation and cell death. Similar proliferative responses to mCD40L and {gamma}c-common cytokines were observed for both immature (ileal) and mature (jejunal) PP B cells. Finally, the capacity of CD40-activated B cells to respond to multiple {gamma}c-common cytokines was analyzed with individual PP B cell clones. All B cell clones displayed similar proliferative responses to IL-2 but quantitatively different responses to IL-4, IL-7 and IL-15. The biological significance of B cell responsiveness to multiple {gamma}c-common cytokines is discussed.""",4
"b'NK cells from long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) were compared with IL-2-activated splenic NK cells [short-term spleen cell culture (STSC)] with regard to expression of inhibitory Ly49 receptors and cytotoxic function. In the LTBMC, the total number of NK cells expressing either one of the Ly49 molecules A, C/I and G2 was strongly reduced (10\x9615% of NK1.1+ cells) compared to the STSC (80\x9690% of NK1.1+ cells). With regard to cytotoxic function, we confirmed that LTBMC-derived NK cells efficiently killed the prototype NK target YAC-1. However, against other targets, killing was more variable. First, while STSC-derived NK cells clearly distinguished MHC class I\x96 from MHC class I+ tumor cell targets, LTBMC-derived NK cells did not; they either killed both targets equally well or not at all. Secondly, LTBMC-derived NK cells were largely incapable of killing lymphoblast targets deficient in MHC class I expression. To test whether this cytotoxic defect was due to the low number of Ly49+ NK cells in the LTBMC, we separated Ly49+ and Ly49\x96 NK cells by cell sorting and tested them individually. This experiment showed that only Ly49+ NK cells in the LTBMC were able to kill MHC class I\x96 lymphoblasts (and to distinguish them from MHC class I+), despite good cytotoxicity against YAC-1 cells in both populations. These data suggest that certain modes of NK cell triggering are dependent on Ly49 receptor expression. From our results, we speculate that inhibitory receptors are expressed before triggering receptors for normal self cells during NK cell development, which may be an important mechanism to preserve self tolerance during the early stages of NK cell maturation.\r\n\r\n'",4
"b'Sir\x97We read with interest the article of Moore et al. about the relationship between psychological stress and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in middle-aged Caucasian men.1 Several dimensions of psychological stress, including occupational and those originating from lifestyle and life events, had little or no impact on the incidence of IHD. As their study pooled IHD into one category and was limited to men, they could not discuss the potential relationship for the different categories of heart diseases or among women.\r\n\r\nIn our previous two studies, one using the case-control2 and the other cohort approach,3 we had different results. Several measures of war-related stressful events associated significantly with heart disease morbidity and mortality, in both men and women. War-related stressors were drawn from events experienced by individuals during the war in Lebanon, similar to those originating from life events. These included acute events such as deaths, injuries and kidnappings in the family, and chronic strains such as economic pressures, frequent displacements, and crossing green lines. In both studies, long-term stress has shown more conclusive results. For example, in our case-control study, crossing the \x91green-lines\x92 that separated the two belligerent sides during wartime, considered an attribute of chronic stress, associated significantly with arteriographically determined coronary disease. In the more recent cohort study, while specific types of acute and chronic events associated with cardiovascular disease mortality, the largest contribution to risk of mortality in women appeared to ensue from stressors due to \x91kidnappings\x92 where the individual remained missing. In both studies, there was a dose-response relationship between exposure to cumulative score of war events and outcome. Moore et al correctly raise several issues and limitations in studies of psychological stress and heart disease. They also indicate that their negative findings may be explained by information bias, because of the potential of frequent change in exposure during follow-up. They suggest that, in future cohort studies, stress should be measured at regular intervals. In our cohort study,3 stressful events were assessed for the 10-year follow-up period, and were modelled in the analysis as time-dependent variables. This allowed for an examination of impact of long-term psychological stress on risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.\r\n\r\nAlthough the role of psychosocial stress factors in the natural history of heart disease has been widely investigated, several issues remain not yet as clear. Studies vary in their definition of psychological stress, recall period, study population and outcome considered, allowing only very general comparisons to be made. Researchers in the field need to differentiate between the immediate impact of events and the role of accumulation of stressful experiences at different stages of the natural history of heart disease.'",3
"b""Acute and chronic administration of ethanol leads to alterations of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) signal transduction pathway. This study examined whether the formation of cAMP by AC in lymphocytes correlates with age in alcoholic patients and in healthy controls. Blood was drawn for preparation of lymphocyte membranes and for determination of basal, GTP{gamma}S-stimulated, and forskolin-stimulated AC activity from 68 actively drinking alcoholic patients (age, mean \xb1 SD: 45 \xb1 10; range: 26\x9669 years) after ethanol detoxification. The patients' AC activity correlated negatively with age. In contrast, no effect of age was observed in the healthy controls (age, mean \xb1 SD: 42 \xb1 11; range: 24\x9665 years). The age-related decrease in AC activity of alcoholic patients could not be attributed to the duration of regular alcohol intake. It was partly due to the large variance of AC activity in younger and middle-aged alcoholics.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'The EGF-TM7 family (CD97 and EMR1) is a group of class II seven-span transmembrane receptors predominantly expressed by cells of the immune system. Recently, we have identified CD55, a regulatory molecule of the complement cascade, as a cellular ligand of human CD97 (hCD97). In this study, the molecular properties of mouse CD97 (mCD97) are described. Like hCD97, mCD97 has an extended extracellular region with several epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains. Due to alternative RNA splicing, isoforms with three and four EGF domains exist, designated mCD97(EGF1,2,4) and mCD97(EGF1,2,3,4) respectively. All EGF domains, except for the N-terminal one, possess a calcium-binding site. In a third isoform mCD97(EGF1,2,X,3,4), a sequence of 45 amino acids was found between the second and third EGF domain that does not correspond to any known protein module. Using newly generated mCD97 mAb, we show that analogous to the blood expression pattern of hCD97, mCD97 can be found on lymphoid and myeloid cells. Adhesion of mouse erythrocytes and splenocytes to COS cells expressing mCD97(EGF1,2,4) or mCD97(EGF1,2,3,4) could be blocked by mouse CD55 (mCD55) antibody, identifying mCD55 as a cellular ligand for mCD97. Consistent with the necessity of directly linked EGF domains for the integrity of the CD55-binding site on hCD97, no adhesion was detected to the largest mouse isoform mCD97(EGF1,2,X,3,4). Remarkably, we found that the interaction between CD97 and CD55 is phylogenetically restricted, as indicated by the selective adhesion of primate erythrocytes to hCD97 transfectants, and of mouse and rat erythrocytes to mCD97 transfectants respectively.'",4
"b'Pyramidal cells initiate the formation of dendritic arbors in a prolific burst of neurite outgrowth during early cortical development. Although morphologically mature pyramidal neurons do not normally sprout additional primary dendrites, the discovery of ectopic dendritogenesis in neuronal storage diseases has revealed that these cells do retain this ability under appropriate stimulation. The capacity for renewal of dendritogenesis has been found to exhibit a species gradient with human > cat, dog, sheep > mouse. A consistent metabolic feature of ectopic dendrite-bearing pyramidal neurons is a heightened intracellular expression of GM2 ganglioside. Elevated expression of this same glycosphingolipid has also been found to correlate with normal dendritogenesis. Immature neurons in developing cat and ferret cortex exhibit high levels of GM2 ganglioside immunoreactivity coincident with normal dendritic sprouting and a similar relationship has now been shown for human cortical development. Ultrastructural studies of all three species revealed GM2 localized to vesicles in a manner consistent with Golgi synthesis and exocytic trafficking to the somatic\x96dendritic plasmalemma. We propose that GM2 ganglioside functions in glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (lipid rafts) in the plasmalemma to promote dendritic initiation through modulation of specific membrane proteins and/or their associated second messenger cascades.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background A growing body of literature suggests that physical activity may be a protective factor against hip fracture.\r\n\r\nMethods To study the association between hip fracture risk and recreational physical activity at various ages, changes in activity during adult life, occupational physical activity and how risks vary by adult weight change, we performed a population-based case-control study among postmenopausal women aged 50\x9681 years residing in six counties in Sweden in 1993\x961995. The analysis consisted of 1327 women with hip fracture and 3262 randomly selected controls. Information on leisure physical activity before age 18, at 18\x9630 years and during recent years was based on a questionnaire. Data on occupational physical activity were collected through an independent classification of job titles obtained from record linkage with census data from 1960, 1970 and 1980.\r\n\r\nResults There was a protective effect of recent leisure physical activity. Compared to women who reported no leisure activity, the odds ratios (OR) were 0.79 (95% CI : 0.62\x961.00), 0.67 (95% CI : 0.54\x960.84) and 0.48 (95% CI : 0.39\x960.60) for women who exercised <1 h per week, 1\x962 h per week, and 3+ h per week, respectively. These decreased OR were more pronounced in women who had lost weight after 18 years of age than in those who had gained weight. Women with high physical activity at both 18\x9630 years and during recent years did not have a stronger protection than those with isolated high activity late in life, after accounting for recent activity. Occupational physical activity was not associated with hip fracture risk in this study.\r\n\r\nConclusions Recent physical activity is protective against hip fracture. The protective effect is most pronounced in women who had lost weight after age 18.\r\n\r\nKeywords Case-control study, epidemiology, exercise, hip fracture, physical activity'",3
"b'Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferases). Individual GalNAc-transferases appear to have different functions and Northern analysis indicates that they are differently expressed in different organs. This suggests that O-glycosylation may vary with the repertoire of GalNAc-transferases expressed in a given cell. In order to study the repertoire of GalNAc-transferases in situ in tissues and changes in tumors, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with well defined specificity for human GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3. Application of this panel of novel antibodies revealed that GalNAc- transferases are differentially expressed in different cell lines, in spermatozoa, and in oral mucosa and carcinomas. For example, GalNAc-T1 and -T2 but not -T3 were highly expressed in WI38 cells, and GalNAc-T3 but not GalNAc-T1 or -T2 was expressed in spermatozoa. The expression patterns in normal oral mucosa were found to vary with cell differentiation, and for GalNAc-T2 and -T3 this was reflected in oral squamous cell carcinomas. The expression pattern of GalNAc-T1 was on the other hand changed in tumors to either total loss or expression in cytological poorly differentiated tumor cells, where the normal undifferentiated cells lacked expression. These results demonstrate that the repertoire of GalNAc-transferases is different in different cell types and vary with cellular differentiation, and malignant transformation. The implication of this is not yet fully understood, but it suggests that specific changes in sites of O-glycosylation of proteins may occur as a result of changes in the repertoire of GalNAc-transferases.'",2
"b'Background Most previous epidemiological studies have treated testicular cancer as a single entity. However, some investigators suggest that testicular seminomas and non-seminomas may have different risk profiles. We examine the time trends in incidence of the two main histological types separately.\r\n\r\nMethods From 1970 through 1995, 7296 cases of testicular cancer were registered in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. In addition to analyses of the secular trends by age group and birth cohort, an age-period-cohort (APC) model with standard Poisson assumptions was fitted to the data to assess the time effects.\r\n\r\nResults The age-adjusted incidence rate for seminomas increased by 53%, from 1.5 per 100 000 males in 1970\x961971 to 2.3 per 100 000 males in 1994\x961995. Non-seminomas increased by 91%, from 1.1 to 2.1 per 100 000 males over the same period. Non-seminomas were more frequent at young ages whereas seminomas dominated in older ages. In contrast to seminomas, non-seminomas occurred predominantly among adolescent men (15\x9619 years), with a fourfold increase between 1970\x961971 and 1994\x961995. Age-period-cohort modelling showed that the increase in the risk of both seminomas and non-seminomas followed a birth cohort pattern, but with differences in birth cohorts in addition to significantly distinct age patterns.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our findings support the hypothesis postulating aetiological heterogeneity in the development of seminomas and non-seminomas. We suggest that epidemiological studies of testicular cancer treat seminomas and non-seminomas separately.'",3
"b'The glycation of liver histones was studied in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, in ethanol (EtOH)-treated rats, and in EtOH-treated diabetic rats. In diabetes, the conditions of glucose-protein addition are more favourable extracellularly in serum and in erythrocytes than in the nucleus. This is indicated by the increased level of serum fructosamine and by the high level of glycated haemoglobin, while the glycation of intracellular histone is decreased. In the serum of diabetic rats, we found a relatively high acetaldehyde level, which resulted in elevated histone fluorescence. Fluorescence is an accepted marker of advanced glycation end-product (AGE), the intensity of which, according to our experiments is related not to the level of serum glucose, but to the level of acetaldehyde. The data obtained with histone proteins in diabetic rats treated with EtOH are in good agreement with the results of our earlier in vitro experimental results obtained with H1 histone: the reaction of the two aldehydes (glucose and acetaldehyde) in combination gives a lower glycohistone value than they do separately.'",0
"b""Background Recognized outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease (LD) are rare; when they occur, they provide opportunities to understand the epidemiology of the illness and improve prevention strategies. We investigated a population-based outbreak.\r\n\r\nMethods After the confirmation of LD in October 1996 in five people in neighbouring towns in southwest Virginia, active surveillance for additional cases was undertaken. A case-control study was conducted to identify exposures associated with illness, followed by a cohort study among employees of the facility at which the source of the outbreak was located in order to assess unrecognized exposure and illness. Samples of likely sources of LD in the facility were cultured for Legionella.\r\n\r\nResults In all, 23 laboratory-confirmed cases of LD were eventually identified. Of the 15 cases in the case-control study, 14 (93%) reported visiting a home-improvement store, compared with 12 (27%) of 45 controls (matched odds ratio [MOR] = 23.3; 95% CI : 3\x96182). Among home-improvement centre patrons, 10 (77%) of 13 cases questioned recalled either visiting or walking by a display whirlpool spa, compared with 3 (25%) of 12 controls (MOR = 5.5; 95% CI : 0.7\x96256.0). Two cases' sputum isolates were an exact match, by monoclonal antibody subtyping and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, to a whirlpool spa filter isolate from the store. Employees reporting more exposure to the display spas were more likely to report symptoms of LD or to have an elevated titre.\r\n\r\nConclusions This investigation shows that LD can be transmitted from a whirlpool spa used for display only, and highlights the need for minimizing the risk of transmission of LD from all water-filled spas.\r\n\r\nKey messages This paper describes an investigation of a population-based outbreak of Legion-naires' disease (LD). A case-control study first identified a home-improvement store as the likely source of the outbreak.

The spa was intended and used for display only.""",3
"b'An IgG2a monoclonal antibody anti-glucosylceramide was established and termed MEST-2. High performance thin layer chromatography immunostaining, and solid-phase radioimmunoassay showed that MEST-2 reacts with glucosylceramide from yeast and mycelium forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Sporothrix schenckii; from hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus; and from yeast forms of Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Cryptococcus albidus. Studies on the fine specificity of MEST-2 showed that it recognizes the \xdf-D-glucose residue, and that the 2-hydroxy group present in the fatty acid is an important auxiliary feature for the antibody binding. It was also demonstrated that phosphatidylcholine and ergosterol modulate MEST-2 reactivity to glucosylceramide, by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that MEST-2 reacts with the surface of yeast forms of P. brasiliensis, H. capsulatum and S. schenckii. Weak staining of mycelial forms of P. brasiliensis and hyphae of A. fumigatus was also observed. The availability of a monoclonal antibody specific to fungal glucosylceramide, and its potential use in analyzing biological roles attributed to glucosylceramide in fungi are discussed.'",2
"b'\xdf-1,2-linked mannosides from Candida albicans phosphopeptidomannan (PPM) bind to macrophages through a receptor independent from the macrophage {alpha}-linked mannose receptor and stimulate these cells to secrete immune mediators. Anti-\xdf-1,2-linked mannoside but not anti-{alpha}-linked mannoside antibodies produced after immunization with neoglycoproteins protect animals from disseminated candidiasis. In this study, peptides that mimic \xdf-1,2-linked mannosides were isolated using phage display methodology. A phage library expressing random peptides was panned with an anti-\xdf-1,2-linked mannoside monoclonal antibody (mAb). After three rounds of biopanning, the isolated phages were able to inhibit recognition of C. albicans by the mAb. Sixty percent of the phages had an identical DNA insert corresponding to the peptide sequence FHENWPS that was recognized specifically by the mAb. Injection of KLH-coupled peptide into mice generated high titers of polyclonal antibodies against C. albicans yeast cell walls. The anti-FHENWPS antibodies bound to C. albicans PPM and were inhibited by soluble \xdf-1,2-mannotetraose. Together, these data provide evidence for mimotopic activity of the peptide selected by biopanning with the anti-\xdf-1,2-oligomannoside mAb'",2
"b'Previous investigations on the monkey kidney COS cell line demonstrated the weak expression of fucosylated cell surface antigens and presence of endogenous fucosyltransferase activities in cell extracts. RT-PCR analyses have now revealed expression of five homologs of human fucosyltransferase genes, FUT1, FUT4, FUT5, FUT7, and FUT8, in COS cell mRNA. The enzyme in COS cell extracts acting on unsialylated Type 2 structures is closely similar in its properties to the [alpha]1,3-fucosyltransferase encoded by human FUT4 gene and does not resemble the product of the FUT5 gene. Although FUT1 is expressed in the COS cell mRNA, it has not been possible to demonstrate [alpha]1,2-fucosyltransferase activity in cell extracts but the presence of Ley and blood-group A antigenic determinants on the cell surface imply the formation of H-precursor structures at some stage. The most strongly expressed fucosyltransferase in the COS cells is the [alpha]1,6-enzyme transferring fucose to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine unit in N-glycan chains; this enzyme is similar in its properties to the product of the human FUT8 gene. The enzymes resembling the human FUT4 and FUT8 gene products both had pH optima of 7.0 and were resistant to 10 mM NEM. The incorporation of fucose into asialo-fetuin was optimal at 5.5 and was inhibited by 10 mM NEM. This result initially suggested the presence of a third fucosyltransferase expressed in the COS cells but we have now shown that triantennary N-glycans with terminal nonreducing galactose units, similar to those present in asialo-fetuin, are modified by a weak endogenous [beta]-galactosidase in the COS cell extracts and thereby rendered suitable substrates for the [alpha]1,6-fucosyltransferase.'",2
"b'Properties of sequence-sensitive neurons in primary auditory cortex of cats were explored in detail. Stimuli were sequences of two tones, in which the frequency and intensity of the first tone and the temporal separation between the first and second, or probe, tone were parametrically varied. After presentation of the first tone, the responses of 32 single units and 48 multiunits to the probe tone were found to be enhanced up to 140\x965270% (median 340%) above the response obtained in the single-tone condition. Probe tone enhancement was induced from a considerable number of sequence conditions and depended on the frequency and intensity of the first tone and on the temporal separation between the onsets of the first and the probe tone. On average, the maximally enhanced response occurred when the first tone was 1 octave below or above the probe tone and its intensity was 14 dB louder than the probe tone. The most effective temporal separation of the tones for an enhancement effect was ~100 ms. The range of enhancing tones was largely outside the excitatory tuning curve of a neuron. Results extend previous findings of properties of sequence-sensitive neurons in the auditory cortex of echolocating bats and non-echolocating mammals, and suggest that sequence-sensitive neurons are quite common and involved in the cortical representation of spectrotemporal patterns of acoustic signals.'",1
"b'Background This multicentre population-based case-control study was conducted to estimate the urothelial cancer risk for occupational exposure to aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and chlorinated hydrocarbons besides other suspected risk factors.\r\n\r\nMethods In a population-based multicentre study, 1035 incident urothelial cancer cases and 4298 controls matched for region, sex, and age were interviewed between 1991 and 1995 for their occupational history and lifestyle habits. Exposure to the agents under study was self-assessed as well as expert-rated with two job-exposure matrices and a job task-exposure matrix. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate smoking adjusted odds ratios (OR) and to control for study centre and age.\r\n\r\nResults Urothelial cancer risk following exposure to aromatic amines was only slightly elevated. Among males, substantial exposures to PAH as well as to chlorinated solvents and their corresponding occupational settings were associated with significantly elevated risks after adjustment for smoking (PAH exposure, assessed with a job-exposure matrix: OR = 1.6, 95% CI : 1.1\x962.3, exposure to chlorinated solvents, assessed with a job task-exposure matrix : OR = 1.8, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.6). Metal degreasing showed an elevated urothelial cancer risk among males (OR = 2.3, 95% CI : 1.4\x963.8). In females also, exposure to chlorinated solvents indicated a urothelial cancer risk. Because of small numbers the risk evaluation for females should be treated with caution.\r\n\r\nConclusions Occupational exposure to aromatic amines could not be shown to be as strong a risk factor for urothelial carcinomas as in the past. A possible explanation for this finding is the reduction in exposure over the last 50 years. Our results strengthen the evidence that PAH may have a carcinogenic potential for the urothelium. Furthermore, our results indicate a urothelial cancer risk for the use of chlorinated solvents.'",3
"b'When founded in 1980, the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) co-existed with the American Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) and the Japanese Medical Society of Alcohol Studies (JMSAS). To strengthen European alcohol research and cooperation between European scientists involved in alcohol research, it appeared desirable to build up a counterpart to the North American and Japanese societies which would cover all of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the initiative of J.-P. von Wartburg, at that time President of ISBRA, a Steering Committee for the foundation of a European Alcohol Research Society was set up during the 1982 ISBRA Congress in Munich, Germany.

The name chosen for the new Society was the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ESBRA) and its by-laws were deposited in Brussels and the Society was registered on 12 March 1987 as a scientific non-profit-making association by the Belgian Ministry of Justice under the authority of King Baudouin.'",0
"b'he primary visual cortex (V1) of primates receives signals from parallel lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) channels. These signals are utilized by the laminar and compartmental [i.e. cytochrome oxidase (CO) blob and interblob] circuitry of V1 to synthesize new output pathways appropriate for the next steps of analysis. Within this framework, this study had two objectives: (i) to analyze the con- nections between primary input and output layers and compartments of V1; and (ii) to determine differences in connection patterns that might be related to species differences in physiological properties in an effort to link specific pathways to visual functions. In this study we examined the intrinsic interlaminar connections of V1 in the owl monkey, a nocturnal New World monkey, with a special emphasis on the projections from layer 4 to layer 3. Interlaminar connections were labeled via small iontophoretic or pressure injections of tracers [horseradish peroxidase, biocytin, biotinylated dextrine amine (BDA) or cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to colloidal gold particles]. Our most significant finding was that layer 4 (4C of Brodmann) can be divided into three tiers based upon projections to the superficial layers. Specifically, we find that 4{alpha} (4C{alpha}), 4\xdf (4C\xdf) and 4ctr send primary projections to layers 3C (4B), 3B\xdf (4A) and 3B{alpha} (3B), respectively. Examination of laminar structure with Nissl staining supports a tripartite organization of layer 4. The cortical output layer above layer 3B{alpha} (3B) (e.g. layer 3A) does not appear to receive any direct connections from layer 4 but receives heavy input from layers 3B{alpha} (3B) and 3C (4B). Some connectional differences also were observed between the subdivisions of layer 3 and the infragranular layers. No consistent differences in connections were observed that distinguished CO blobs from interblobs or that could be correlated with differences in visual lifestyle (nocturnal versus diurnal) when compared with connectional data in other primates. Re-examination of data from previous studies in squirrel and macaque monkeys suggests that the tripartite organization of layer 4 and the unique projection pattern of layer 4ctr are not restricted to owl monkeys, but are common to a number of primate species.'",1
"b'Visual cortical lesions destroy the target cells for geniculocortical fibers from a certain retinotopic region. This leads to a cortical scotoma. We have investigated the receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex before, 2 days and 2 months after focal ibotenic acid lesions in the adult cat visual cortex and have found signs of receptive field plasticity in the surroundings of the chronic but not the acute and subacute excitotoxic lesions. In the subacute state (first two days post lesion) receptive field sizes of cells at the border of the lesion were reduced in size or remained unchanged. Remapping of cortical receptive fields 2 months later revealed a number of cells with multifold enlarged receptive fields at the border of the lesion. The cells with enlarged receptive fields displayed orientation and direction selectivity like normal cells. The size increase appeared not specifically directed towards the scotoma; however, the enlarged receptive fields can reduce the extent of a cortical scotoma, since previously unresponsive regions of the visual field activate cortical cells at the border of the lesion. This late receptive field plasticity could serve as a mechanism for the filling-in of cortical scotomata observed in patients with visual cortex lesions.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'This paper describes a new stage in the ongoing evaluation of the original families of sons of alcoholics and controls where we now focus on the relationships among relevant domains of functioning in their young sons and daughters. Methods: The data were gathered from the 15-year follow-up of the families of the original probands (the fathers of these offspring) who had been selected from among students and non-academic staff at a university at approximately age 20. At the 15-year evaluation of these families, a structured interview and the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire were administered to a parent, usually the mother, of 145 offspring age seven through 17. The eight domains evaluated here included the extended family histories of alcohol use disorders, parental alcoholism, independent mood or anxiety disorders in the grandparents and parents, the history of potential brain insults early in life, the absence of a biological parent in the home, and scores for internalizing symptoms, with externalizing symptoms as the dependent variable. Results: Correlations among the domains were all in the predicted direction, a structural equation model revealed empirical results with an R2 of 0.26, and there were high goodness of fit characteristics for hypothesized and empirical models. The results were similar for boys and girls and older versus younger offspring. Conclusions: An understanding of the relationships among characteristics in the offspring of the original probands offers the opportunity of establishing levels of functioning in relevant domains before the onset of alcohol-related problems or related disorders. The data presented here represent a baseline upon which future follow-ups will evaluate substance-related problems and disorders as this population matures.'",0
b'Clinically unaffected sons of male alcoholics differ from controls without a family history of alcoholism in two respects: increased autonomic reactivity to aversive as well as non-aversive stimuli and increased attenuation of these responses by alcohol. This pattern of autonomic hyper-reactivity and alcohol-induced stress response dampening (SRD) might be a trait marker of genetic vulnerability and is often interpreted in terms of a diathesis stress model of alcohol dependence. Forty-five alcohol-dependent men (mean age: 39.20 years) and 37 healthy controls (mean age: 35.03 years) participated in a double-blind cross-over study in two experimental sessions each. The benzodiazepine lorazepam was selected as an alcohol substitute. Autonomic reactivity and lorazepam-induced SRD were assessed during incentive and non-incentive reaction time tasks as well as mental arithmetics. Alcohol-dependent men showed elevated resting heart rate levels and increased number of non-specific electrodermal responses. Evidence for autonomic hyper-reactivity was found for a subgroup of alcoholics with a family history of alcoholism.\r\n\r\n',0
"b""The acquisition of definitive evidence for systematic hemispheric asymmetries in the size of the planum temporale (PT) has been restricted by difficulties in identifying, standardizing and measuring the region of interest. In this paper an operational definition for identifying the problematic posterior border of the PT on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is proposed. An interactive voxel-painting program was used to identify and label the PT simultaneously in horizontal, sagittal and coronal planes in MRI scans, transformed into the standardized Talairach\x96Tournoux stereotaxic space, from 50 normal right-handed volunteers. Both grey matter volume and cortical surface area of the PT were measured, while controlling for individual variation in overall brain shape and volume. The labeled tissue was averaged together to produce a probability map in standardized space of the region of interest. The PT region is highly variable, with no single voxel being labeled with a probability of >65%. In this study there were no significant hemispheric differences in volume or area of the PT. An asymmetry in area and volume was introduced by using an alternative method \x96 the `knife-cut' method \x96 for identifying the posterior border. Implications for functional neuroimaging of the PT are discussed.""",1
"b'Alcohol consumption is often under-reported in patients admitted to general hospitals with acute illness. For alcohol-dependent individuals hospital admission results in an enforced period of abstinence with potential alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and possible life threatening complications. Early detection of alcohol use is therefore beneficial to patients and health services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) questionnaire in the acute medical setting, and the effect of combining routine biological markers\x97glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) on its performance in the early identification of in-patients with alcohol use disorders and at risk of developing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Methods: Prospective study in consecutive patients admitted to an acute medical admissions ward. All patients were screened using the AUDIT questionnaire and routine blood tests. Patients were then monitored for symptoms of withdrawal using clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-Ar). Results: Of the 874 patients screened using the AUDIT, 98 (11%) screened positive of whom 17 (2% of the 874) experienced clinically significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms, when using serial CIWA-Ar. The AUDIT and serial CIWA-Ar detected all patients who went on to manifest acute withdrawal symptoms. There was no loss of sensitivity at an AUDIT cut-off of 13 or more compared with the lower cut-off of 8 or more. A positive predictive value of 17.3% for an AUDIT score of 8 or more in the detection of withdrawal, increased to 47.1% when found in combination with at least two abnormal biological markers whilst maintaining a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 97.9%. Conclusion: These findings confirm that AUDIT is a useful alcohol screen in general medical settings and that its ability to correctly predict which patients will experience alcohol withdrawal is increased when used in combination with biological markers.'",0

However, findings from epidemiological studies assessing physical activity and risk of prostate cancer are inconsistent.\r\n\r\nMethods We prospectively examined the association between physical activity and prostate cancer risk in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS), a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and beta-carotene among 22 071 men aged 40\x9684 without self-reported myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer. At baseline in 1982, men were asked about the frequency of exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat. Physical activity was assessed in a similar fashion again at 36 months of follow-up.\r\n\r\nResults During 11.1 years of follow-up (258 779 person-years), 982 cases of prostate cancer occurred and were confirmed by medical record review. After adjustment for potential confounding factors (including age, height, randomized treatment assignment, smoking status, alcohol intake, use of multivitamins, history of diabetes, history of hypertension and history of high cholesterol), the relative risks for prostate cancer associated with exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat were 1.0 (referent) for frequency less than once per week, 1.02 (95% CI : 0.82\x961.26) for once per week, 1.07 (95% CI : 0.90\x961.27) for 2\x964 times per week, and 1.11 (95% CI : 0.90\x961.36) for 5+ times per week. Across all subgroups of men categorized by age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, use of multivitamins, history of diabetes, history of hypertension and history of high cholesterol, there were no significant associations between frequency of exercise vigorous enough to work up a sweat and prostate cancer risk. After excluding cases of prostate cancer that occurred during the first 36 months of follow-up, again, there was no significant association. Combining physical activity assessments at baseline and at 36 months also yielded no significant association with prostate cancer risk.\r\n\r\nConclusions These observational data from the Physicians' Health Study do not support the hypothesis that increased physical activity reduces the risk of prostate cancer.""",3
"b'BackgroundEvidence for a causal relationship between presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in gastric mucosa and development of peptic disease is based largely on intervention studies in which eradication of H. pylori led to healing of the lesion. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of H. pylori seropositivity for subsequent development of peptic disease in a prospective study design in young Israelis.\r\n\r\nMethodsA nested case-control serum bank study based on a systematic sample of male and female inductees to the Israel Defense Force. Twenty-nine cases of duodenal ulcer or duodenitis of moderate or higher severity, diagnosed between 1986 and 1995, were individually matched for age, sex, ethnicity, education and year of induction, with five healthy controls each. Presence of anti-H. pylori antibodies in the frozen stored sera was determined by ELISA.\r\n\r\nResultsThe geometric mean titre of anti-H. pylori antibodies at baseline was significantly higher in cases (18.3 U/ml) than controls (6.9 U/ml; P = 0.009). The matched odds ratio for peptic ulcer disease by seropositivity was 3.8 (95% CI : 1.4\x9610.2). A stronger association was evident for subjects diagnosed >=2 years after induction than those diagnosed earlier. The population attributable fraction was 56.6% (95% CI : 15.7\x9681.1).\r\n\r\nConclusionsPre-existing infection with H. pylori, as determined by seropositivity, is an important determinant of development of duodenal ulcer or duodenitis in young Israelis, supporting the generalizability of an apparent causal association to diverse populations.'",3
"b'Th1- and Th2-related cytokines (IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10), \xdf-chemokines (RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\xdf) and their receptor [chemotatic cytokine receptor (CCR) 5], and the cytolytic effector molecule [Fas ligand (FasL)] play an essential role in regulating and co-ordinating acute renal allograft rejection. A chimeric model of acute cellular rejection which involves subcapsular grafting of human renal tissue in the kidneys of immunodeficient rats and subsequent i.p. infusion of allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was used to study cellular infiltration patterns and sequential intragraft gene expression of these key inflammatory mediators. We found that while all molecules are expressed within the human renal implant at specific time points following infusion of allogeneic human PBMC, peak mRNA expression of IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, RANTES and CCR5 is associated with a phase of human mononuclear infiltration and accumulation, prior to graft destruction (induction phase). A short burst of FasL gene expression is found at the end of induction and at the onset of graft deterioration. IL-4 mRNA, which is hardly detectable, and IL-10 mRNA, which appears early and persists throughout follow-up at high levels, both peak after the induction phase with the advent of graft destruction. Furthermore, treatment with CTLA-4\x96Ig, which hardly affects migration of human effector cells into graft tissue, is associated with a temporary reduction in gene transcript levels for all inflammatory mediators, especially IL-2 and IL-4, reduced apoptosis in the graft and amelioration of tissue injury. Thus, development of acute cellular rejection in our chimeric model involves a co-ordinated pattern of gene expression, in which CTLA-4\x96Ig promotes its effects by transient inactivation of infiltrating human cells.'",4
"b'We describe a novel neuronal group of the neocortical primordium that is formed by the pioneer neurons, unlike the Cajal\x96Retzius cells and the subplate component of the preplate. These pioneer neurons of the preplate and the marginal zone send transient axonal projections into the nascent internal capsule, preceding the formation of the axonal projection from the subplate neurons. In wholemount preparations, the pioneer neurons of the preplate and the marginal zone cover the prospective neocortical territory from embryonic day (E) 12 to E17. Two subpopulations of pioneer neurons (defined by differential expression of calcium-binding proteins) group into well-defined cell clusters, separated by spaces containing a lower packing density of cells immunoreactive to the corresponding calcium-binding protein. In both cases, cell clustering was concomitant with fasciculation of their axons. Although both subpopulations cohabit in the same areas of the marginal zone, their clustering occurs in specific, well-delineated territories, giving a mosaic appearance to the surface of the neocortical primordium before the arrival of thalamocortical axons. We hypothesize that the fascicles of descending axons arising from defined territories of the marginal zone may intervene in the initial guidance of the subcortical projection from the subplate.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Background This study assessed the nature of potential biases by comparing respondents with non-respondents from a case-control study of breast cancer in younger women.\r\n\r\nMethods The case-control study was conducted in three regions in the US: Atlanta GA, Seattle/Puget Sound WA, and central New Jersey. An abbreviated interview or mailed questionnaire was completed by willing non-respondents, most of whom had refused participation in the main study.\r\n\r\nResults Respondents and non-respondents appeared similar with respect to age, race, relative weight, smoking, family history of breast cancer, number of births, age at first birth, and several dietary items. Compared to non-respondents, case and control respondents were of shorter stature, and reported less frequent consumption of doughnuts/pastries. Respondent cases, compared with non-respondent cases, were more highly educated and more likely to have consumed alcohol regularly; similar but not statistically significant tendencies were observed for controls. Respondent cases experienced menarche earlier than non-respondents. Respondent controls were more likely to have used oral contraceptives than non-respondents; a similar but not statistically significant tendency was observed in cases. Comparisons of crude and simulated relative risks using available non-respondents' data generally showed a low impact of non-response on relative risks in this study.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our results suggest that non-response would not greatly affect relative risk estimates in this study, except possibly regarding height. However, we were limited by the numbers of informative non-respondents and the amount of data collected. Collecting similar information in future studies would be useful, especially since varying methods used to encourage participation may lead to differences in respondents' characteristics.""",3
"b'Selectively bred high-alcohol sensitive (HAS) and low-alcohol sensitive (LAS) rats possess a number of behavioural and electrophysiological differences in their responses to alcohol. Using a microdialysis technique, we have evaluated whether the levels of the amino acids aspartate, glutamate, arginine, taurine, and alanine in HAS and LAS rats differ in their response to ethanol administration (2 g/kg, i.p.). The basal concentrations of each amino acid in these two groups were statistically similar. Following ethanol injection, alanine, arginine, and glutamate were significantly decreased in HAS rats, whereas, alanine, glutamate, and taurine were significantly increased in LAS rats by the end of the experiment. Interestingly, an increase in the sulphonated amino acid taurine was only evident 20 min after ethanol administration in the HAS rats, when compared to saline controls. No changes were observed in the other amino acids studied, aspartate and glycine, after ethanol administration. These data suggest that, in addition to differential behavioural responses to alcohol, HAS and LAS rats also differ in their neurochemical responses to ethanol.'",0
"b""Autoantibodies against U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) are frequently present in the serum of patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, and have been reported to be associated with HLA-DR and -DQ genes. To better define the role of HLA genes in the production of such antibodies, we studied immunogenetic associations with autoantibodies reacting with U1 RNP, U1A and SmD1 proteins, and synthetic peptides containing immunodominant linear epitopes of these proteins. Only two out of the 15 overlapping peptides of U1A (i.e. peptides 35\x9658 and 257\x96282) and three of 11 peptides of SmD1 (i.e. peptides 1\x9620, 44\x9667 and 97\x96119) were significantly recognized by patients' sera selected on the basis of their antibody positivity with RNP in immunodiffusion. The distribution of DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 alleles among the anti-RNP antibody-positive patients (n = 28) and healthy control subjects was similar. Antibodies against U1A (tested in Western immunoblotting with HeLa cell extracts) were positively associated to DRB1*06 allele; antibodies reacting with SmD1 peptide 44\x9667 were negatively associated to DRB1*02 and DQB1*0602 alleles. No association was found between DPB1 alleles and antibodies reacting with U1A and SmD1 antigens. This first study reporting an association between autoantibodies reacting with U1A and SmD1 proteins (and peptides of these proteins), and immunogenetic markers suggest that the production of antibody subsets directed against different components (or regions of these proteins) bound to the same snRNP particle is associated with distinct MHC class II alleles.""",4
"b'A significant fraction of women continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, which is associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and spontaneous abortion. The objective of this study was to determine whether the selectively bred genetic drinking Myers High Ethanol Preferring (HEP) rat would continue to drink through pregnancy. Rats from the F7 generation were screened by a 10-day 3\x9630% (v/v) ethanol concentration \x91step up\x92 procedure in order to determine the concentration which resulted in maximal drinking with an ethanol solution to total fluid ratio closest to 0.5. After baseline drinking of the preferred concentrations was established, female HEP rats were randomly selected for mating and their ethanol bottles were removed. Upon finding a \x91sperm plug\x92, male rats were removed and the ethanol was returned. A second group received injections of progesterone in sesame oil beginning with a 1.0 mg/kg/day dose which was increased to 3.0 mg/kg/day on gravid days (GD) 5\x9620. Vaginal smears confirmed that progesterone rendered the rats anoestrous. Neither pregnancy nor progesterone changed either the amount or proportion of ethanol consumed compared to the baseline period. The rats drank an average of 8.4 g/kg daily throughout pregnancy. A sharp drop in food intake was noted the day after mating. Beginning on GD 13, it was observed that pregnant rats showed a marked increase in the variance for proportion of ethanol consumed and body weight. Subsequently, only one of the eight impregnated rats successfully delivered a litter. The ethanol solution was removed and these rats mated again: seven of the eight rats delivered litters. These two findings suggest that the pregnant females must have begun to lose their litters on or after GD 13. Further, pregnancy does not affect the consumption of ethanol in the HEP rat. In addition, due to the fact that drinking by HEP rats during pregnancy leads to such a high rate of resorption of the fetus, this hybrid strain may also constitute a useful model for the study of alcohol-induced spontaneous abortion.'",0
"b'The 165 amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a heparin-binding growth factor with mitogenic activity for vascular endothelial cells. We examined activities of various heparin derivatives toward their interactions with VEGF165 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and elucidated the structural features in heparin for the interactions. Native heparin interacted with VEGF165, whereas N-desulfated, N-acetylated (N-DS, N-Ac-) heparin, and 6-O-desulfated (6-O-DS-) heparin did not. The 2-O-desulfated (2-O-DS-) heparin retained the ability for the interaction with VEGF165. In contrast, the 2-O-DS-heparin exhibited no ability for the interaction with FGF-2 and HGF. Thus, structural requirements in heparin for the specific interaction with VEGF165 are distinct from those with FGF-2 and HGF which require a high content of 2-O-sulfate groups. In a cell proliferation assay, native heparin and 2-O-DS-heparin exhibited inhibitory abilities for VEGF165-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with their high concentrations (more than 64 \xb5g/ml), while only native heparin could enhance the proliferation of the chlorate-treated cells. These results suggested that a high content of 2-O-sulfate groups is not required for the specific interaction with VEGF165 alone, although it is essential for the mitogenic activity of the growth factor.'",2
"b""Schuckit (1983) described two types of alcohol-related depression: (1) the common type, in which secondary depression disappears without treatment within the first few weeks of abstinence; (2) a less frequent type, primary depression, requiring specific treatment. It is difficult to anticipate whether an alcoholic patient needs antidepressive treatment or whether depression will remit spontaneously. A potential guide to differentiate depressed alcoholic patients who might need specific treatment for depression could be the typology of Lesch et al. (1990). Based on the course of the illness, Lesch established four subtypes of alcoholism, taking into account social, psychic and somatic factors: (1) Type 1 is characterized by early withdrawal symptoms and frequent alcohol-related psychoses and convulsions; (2) Type 2 exhibits pre-morbid conflicts and anxiety; (3) Type 3 emerges from a permissive alcoholic milieu and shows pre-alcoholic mood changes; (3) Type 4 has pre-morbid cerebral injuries and serious social problems.\r\n\r\nWe studied depressive syndromes in a consecutive series of 36 (of 45 screened) male inpatients in a closed detoxification ward for 5 weeks, during which abstinence was monitored by alcohol and drug screening. All were primary alcoholics according to Schuckit (1985), namely, no other psychiatric illness was present at the time when alcohol abuse began or earlier. Alcohol dependence was diagnosed according to ICD-10 and DSM-III-R (integrative check-list, The Plinius Maior Society, 1994) with a minimum of five positive items (mean \xb1 SD: 8.2 \xb1 1.8). Exclusion criteria were: any psychiatric co-morbidity, a positive drug screening for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, amphetamines or cannabinoids at onset or at weekly urine checks; any psychopharmacological treatment during the study, except clormethiazole up to 10 days after admission; relapse into alcohol intake. The patients were aged between 25 and 52 (mean 36.8 \xb1 6.8) years. The mean weight was 77.2 (\xb1 12.2) kg. The mean age of first alcohol-related problems was 23.3 \xb1 8.1 years. Three and 5 weeks after admission, an independent interviewer completed the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D; Hamilton 1960). Patients were typed on admission according to Lesch's method.\r\n\r\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for human experiments, and written informed consent was given by each participant. For the statistical analysis, one-way analysis variance (ANOVA) with correction of the {alpha}-error by the Tukey HSD-test and Student's t-test were used.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Fig. 1Go, after 3 weeks, the Ham-D score differed significantly (F = 8.3; P < 0.001) between Lesch's four subtypes. Type 3 (n = 10; Ham-D: 15.3 \xb1 4.7) scored significantly higher than Type 1 (n = 9; Ham-D: 5.4 \xb1 4.1) and Type 4 (n = 7; Ham-D: 7.3 \xb1 3.0). After 5 weeks, nine patients had discontinued therapy and dropped out of the study. Ham-D scores of the 27 remaining subjects were still elevated significantly in Lesch Type 3 (n = 7; Ham-D: 14.9 \xb1 9.2, F = 4.1; P < 0.05), whereas in Type 1 (n = 5; Ham-D: 4.4 \xb1 3.0) and Type 4 (n = 6; Ham-D: 4.7 \xb1 2.7) scores remained low. In Type 2, a significant decline in scores was observed (n = 10; Ham-D: 10.5 \xb1 5.7 to n = 9; 6.3 \xb1 6.4, P < 0.03). The stability of depressive symptoms in Type 3 could indicate, according to Lesch et al. (1988), the primary psychic susceptibility of this group. It is important to note that a bias for self-rating evidence is not the case here. Secondary alcoholics according to Schuckit (1985), who received psychiatric treatment for depressive syndromes, anxiety disorders, etc., before onset of their chronic alcoholism, or by whom such pre-alcoholic episodes could be anamnestically traced, as well as alcoholics with a co-morbidity of an affective disorder were excluded from the study. Primary alcoholics were typed as Lesch's Type 3 when they described drinking alcohol especially as compensation for lethargy, sleep disorders and lack of motivation, and gave a history of intervals of moderate or no alcohol consumption (Lesch et al., 1990Go). Typing the patients of our sample according to Cloninger et al. (1981) revealed no significant group difference in Ham-D scores.\r\nAmongst the group of primary alcoholics with secondary depression an alcoholic subgroup (Lesch's Type 3) is present that shows a stable depressive syndrome despite continuing abstinence. The course of depressive symptoms taken by this group significantly differs from other Types of alcoholics (Lesch et al., 1988Go). Lesch's Type 3 alcoholics who are depresssed may merit treatment with antidepressants. These preliminary observations regarding the course of depression in Lesch's Type 3 and also Type 2, and the impact on possible therapeutic consequences, need further investigation on a larger sample.""",0
"b'Objectives To evaluate contraceptive and reproductive risk factors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in southwestern American Indian women.\r\n\r\nMethods We conducted a clinic-based case-control study. Cases were American Indian women with biopsy-proven CIN I, CIN II or CIN III. Controls were from the same clinics and had normal cervical epithelium. All subjects underwent structured interviews focused on contraceptive and reproductive factors. Laboratory assays included polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\r\n\r\nResults We enrolled 628 women in the study. The strongest risk factors for CIN II/III included HPV infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 7.9, 95% CI : 4.7\x9613.2), and low income (OR = 3.1, 95% CI : 1.7\x965.7). The use of an intrauterine device (IUD) ever (OR = 3.0, 95% CI : 1.4\x966.1) and currently (OR = 4.1, 95% CI : 1.1\x9614.6), and >=3 vaginal deliveries (OR = 5.2, 95% CI : 2.4\x9611.1) were associated with CIN II/III. History of infertility was also associated with CIN II/III (OR = 2.1, 95% CI : 1.0\x964.2).\r\n\r\nConclusions The data suggest that history of infertility, IUD use and vaginal deliveries were associated with CIN among American Indian women.'",3
"b'Background The purpose of this study was to investigate secular trends in waiting times in CD4-based stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression in two cohorts of homosexual men, one in Vancouver and one in Amsterdam. All HIV-positive men with two or more CD4 counts in their AIDS-free period between 1 January 1985 and 1 January 1997 were included in this study. Data regarding clinical AIDS diagnoses (using the 1987 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] AIDS case definition) and death were collected through active follow-up, review of hospital records, and municipal/national registries. The Vancouver Lymphadenopathy-AIDS Study (VLAS), was started in November 1982 and had enrolment until December 1984. Both HIV-negative and HIV-positive men were followed at intervals of 3\x966 months until 1986 and annually thereafter. The Amsterdam cohort study on HIV and AIDS (ACS) started in December 1984, has ongoing enrolment and follow-up of both HIV-negative and HIV-positive homosexual men. The HIV-positive men were followed at intervals of 3 months.\r\n\r\nMethods The CD4-based stage of an individual at each visit was determined using smoothed data. For each cohort and in each calendar time period, a CD4-based Markov model with death as the absorbing stage was fitted to the data. The parameters in this model were estimated using the method of maximum likelihood and confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrap methods.\r\n\r\nResults A total of 509 homosexual men participating in the VLAS were included in this study, providing 5356 visits. Some 292 men developed AIDS before 1 January 1997 and 239 died before this date. In all, 232 of the 239 deaths were AIDS related. Thirty-seven per cent of all visits were related to treatment. A total of 543 homosexual men participating in the ACS were included in this study, providing 10 043 visits; 277 men developed AIDS before 1 January 1997 and 250 died before this date. The date of AIDS diagnosis was known for 225 of the 250 deaths. Twenty per cent of all visits were related to treatment. We found that in both cohort studies the stage-specific waiting times were longer in the low CD4-based stages (stages 4, 5 and 6: i.e. CD4 count <500 cells per mm3) after March 1990 compared to waiting times before March 1990. The increase in mean waiting time in these stages with low CD4 count was 21%, 33% and 53%, respectively in the ACS and 20%, 2% and 29% in the VLAS. Because waiting times alone are not exclusive for progression in a reversible model we also calculated the stage-specific median incubation periods till death. Men spent considerably longer in these CD4-based stages after March 1990 compared to before March 1990.\r\n\r\nConclusions Data from these population-based cohort studies showed that HIV disease progression in the calendar period where treatment was administered was slower for individuals in stages with low CD4 counts. We found no evidence for shortening of the incubation period that may have appeared from increasing virulence of the HIV in the population.'",3
"b"" Little is known about the relationship between current and past smoking behaviour and the severity of alcohol dependence. The purpose was to explore the strength of this relationship. Methods: A random population sample of 18 to 64 year-olds from northern Germany was used (n = 4075; participation rate: 70%). It included 761 cigarette smokers fulfilling at least one alcohol-dependence criterion. The severity of alcohol dependence according to the alcohol-dependence syndrome criteria frequency (ASF) was estimated by a standardized questionnaire based on diagnostic instruments of the alcohol dependence syndrome and which included five response categories, from 'never' to 'daily'. Nicotine dependence was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV) with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). As a second measure, the Fagerstr\xf6m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) was used. Results: The number of cigarettes and years of daily smoking, nicotine dependence, and the number of nicotine dependence symptoms each showed a relationship with the ASF. Effect size (w) were 0.17\x960.21 for chi-squared ({chi}2) tests. In a general linear regression model with the ASF as the dependent variable (R2 = 0.17), number of years of daily smoking, age at onset of smoking, number of attempts to reduce or quit, the number of nicotine-dependence symptoms according to DSM-IV and the FTND sum score were retained as independent variables. Conclusions: Long-term smoking, a large number of nicotine-dependence symptoms according to DSM and a strong urge to smoke according to the FTND are related with a high ASF.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b""It is important to see Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's paper against a backdrop of the history of tobacco, the history of cancer, and the history of how a causal link between the two came to be recognized. Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's paper also has to be seen, though, as a political document, a product of the Nazi ideological focus on tobacco as a corrupting force whose elimination would serve the cause of \x91racial hygiene\x92. Nazi Germany was governed by a health-conscious political elite bent on European conquest and genocidal extermination, and tobacco at this time was viewed as one among many \x91threats\x92 to the health of the chosen Volk.\r\n\r\nExploring this larger political context in this sense tells us something interesting about the nature of the Nazi regime. Nazism was a movement of muscular, health-conscious young men worried about things like the influence of Jews in German culture and the evils of communism, but also about the injurious effects of white bread, asbestos and artificial food dyes. Hitler himself was a vegetarian and did not smoke or drink; Nazi anti-tobacco activists often pointed out that while the three leading fascist leaders of Europe all abstained from tobacco (Mussolini, Franco, and Hitler), the three leading Allied leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) were all heavy users.1\r\n\r\nCancer rates on the rise\r\n\r\nTobacco use skyrocketed at the end of the nineteenth century, following the invention of safety matches (in 1852), the rise of mass consumer marketing, and the invention of the Bonsack cigarette rolling machine (in 1884), which allowed industrial-scale production. Cigarettes were given to soldiers in the First World War, creating an entirely new generation of addicts; national governments also found in tobacco a marvellous source of income, since sales were easily regulated and effectively taxed. Cigarettes became the preferred mode of smoking toward the end of the century, following the development of \x91flue-curing,\x92 a fermentation process that allowed tobacco smoke to be inhaled without coughing. Cigarettes were also more easily packaged and carried than other kinds of tobacco\x97the prepackaged white casings being interestingly similar in this regard to the prepackaged ammunition cartridges invented about this time, with comparable deadly effects.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the rapid growth of cigarette consumption, cancer rates rose explosively in the first decades of the twentieth century. Lung cancer had been an extremely rare disease prior to 1900\x97with only 140 documented cases worldwide2\x97though by the 1930s the disease was the number two cause of cancer death among males in Germany, second only to stomach malignancies.3 A 1944 study would show that lung cancer had actually surpassed stomach tumours to become the leading cause of cancer death among soldiers in the German army, a result not inconsistent, in this military man's view, with a tobacco aetiology.4\r\n\r\nThough German pathologists in the 1920s were among the first to recognize the reality of a lung cancer epidemic,5 cigarettes were not widely blamed until the 1930s. Cigarettes had occasionally come under suspicion (not before 1900, interestingly), but the more common view held that road tar or car exhaust or the flu epidemic of 1919 or even racial mixing or the chemical warfare agents used in World War I were the primary culprits. There were some stragglers who thought that the entire phenomenon might be a statistical artefact of either better diagnosis (notably by X-rays, but also improved bronchoscopy) or more extensive hospitalization, but by the late 1920s pathology institutes in the German-speaking world had mortality statistics reliable enough to show that the Lungenkrebs epidemic was real, and accelerating.\r\n\r\nFritz Lickint of Dresden published the first good statistical evidence of a lung cancer tobacco link in 1929, based on a case series showing that lung cancer sufferers were likely to be smokers. Lickint also argued that tobacco use was the best way to explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less) and that in countries where women also smoked, the sex difference was much smaller.6\r\n\r\nAdam Syrek in 1932 at the University of Cracau argued similarly that it was hard to reconcile a non-tobacco aetiology with the mortality patterns he was finding in rural Poland. Syrek showed that many of the lung cancer deaths recorded at his institute were from rural areas, where cigarette smoking had become popular and polluting industries were virtually non-existent. Syrek also showed that the epidemic had struck Cracau itself, where there were still very few cars and little industry to speak of. The flu epidemic was also an unlikely cause, in his view, since both sexes were equally afflicted by flu. By a process of elimination, Syrek came to the conclusion that tobacco was the most likely cause of the epidemic.7\r\n\r\nThe Nazi impulse\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Nazi regime to power in January 1933 produced several major transformations in German science. Many areas of science with strong Jewish representation\x97psychoanalysis and certain areas of theoretical physics, for example\x97lost many of their leading lights, though other fields, with relatively few Jews, fared better. Sciences that could be regarded as free of Jewish influence, or as useful to the military or racial goals of the regime, were often encouraged.\r\n\r\nPrevention-oriented cancer research was one such area. Part of this had to do with the \x91homeopathic paranoia\x92 of the regime (my term)\x97the fear that small but powerful agents were undermining the German Volksk\xf6rper. The carcinogenic effects of food dyes became a focus of considerable interest, as did the radiogenic lung carcinomas of uranium miners (the so-called \x91Schneeberger\x92 or \x91Joachimstaler Krankheit,\x92 caused by exposure to radon gas in the Erzgebirge of southeast Germany and the German-Czech border), the perils of mercury dental fillings, and the carcinogenic impact of asbestos. By 1939, for example, occupational authorities were routinely listing lung cancer as one of the occupational hazards of exposure to asbestos dust.8 There was a great deal of worry about how to maintain the \x91purity\x92 of Germany\x92s food, air and water, a concern linked ideologically to the more notorious (and eventually criminal) efforts to eliminate \x91foreign racial elements\x92 from the German population.\r\n\r\nThis quest for bodily purity was not unique to Nazi Germany, of course\x97think of the eugenic fervour of some of America's early natural food advocates or even the post-World War II fear of fluoridation, captured dramatically in a remarkable sequence in Stanley Kubrick's film, Dr Strangelove, which has a Cold War-era general obsessing over threats to his \x91precious bodily fluids\x92. The Nazis carried this quest further than other contemporary nations, prompting them to engage in certain areas of cancer research that from today's vantage point look surprisingly progressive. This becomes particularly clear if you look at the source of support for Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's research.\r\n\r\nAstel's institute\r\n\r\nSchairer and Sch\xf6niger's case-control epidemiological study was financed by Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research (or \x91Institute for the Struggle Against Tobacco Hazards\x92, as it was also known), established in 1941 at Jena University by a 100 000 Reichsmarks grant from Hitler's Reich Chancellery. We do not know who first suggested the study, though it could well have been Prof. Dr. med. Astel himself, who ruled over much of this intellectual territory with the iron hand expected from a Nazi F\xfchrer. Astel was a high-ranking SS officer and from 1939 president of the University of Jena; he was also an ardent anti-Semite and euthanasia advocate who served as head of Th\xfcringia's Office of Racial Affairs, an important instrument in the propagation of Nazi political ideals.\r\n\r\nAstel was an early devotee of Hitler, having already marched alongside his beloved F\xfchrer in September 1923 at a Nuremberg rally, earning him the coveted Nazi \x91Golden Badge of Honor,\x92 awarded to the first 100 000 people to join the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP) (more than ten million people eventually joined the Party). Astel was also a rabid anti-tobacco activist, who quickly made a name for himself on the Jena campus by snatching cigarettes from the mouths of smoking students. His institute therefore, not surprisingly, sought to combine both scientific and propagandist work. The institute purchased and distributed 2000 copies of Hans FK G\xfcnther's 8-page Trinken, Rauchen, Gattenwahl (Drinking, Smoking, and Spousal Choice) along with 15 copies of Lickint's Tabak und Organismus (at 50 RM each), hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft (Pure Air), the most important anti-tobacco journal of the era, and 3000 copies of Emil Skramlik's compilation of Goethe's views on tobacco. Skramlik also received at least 15 000 RM to produce an anti-tobacco film (Genussmittel Tabak)\x97and though much of it was apparently finished by 1944, the film itself has since disappeared. Skramlik went on to become president of the University of Jena after the war, succeeding Astel, who shot himself in the University Medical Clinic in April of 1945, after apparently destroying all his files.\r\n\r\nSchairer and Sch\xf6niger's paper was largely based on Sch\xf6niger's medical dissertation, submitted in 1944. Sch\xf6niger's, though, was only one of several dissertations produced at Astel's institute. Gabriele Schulze and K\xe4te Dischner in their jointly written Die Zigarettenraucherin (\x91The Female Cigarette Smoker\x92, Jena, 1942), for example, interviewed 165 women as part of a study of the physical and psychological effects of nicotine withdrawal. Most of the women studied were incarcerated at prisons in Weimar, Gera or Kleinmuesdorf near Leipzig, where smoking was forbidden; the dissertation records the women's cries for cigarettes, and attempts to classify female smokers by menstrual patterns, \x91constitutional type\x92 (asthenic, pyknic, leptosome, etc.), and criminal behaviour. The authors claimed that smoking made one vulnerable to tuberculosis and called for a total smoking ban for women, consistent with the Nazi slogan \x91Die deutsche Frau raucht nicht!\x92 (The German woman does not smoke!).\r\n\r\nRacial hygienists distinguished \x91positive\x92, \x91negative\x92 and \x91preventive\x92 racial hygiene, encompassing: (1) encouragement of breeding among the \x91fit\x92 (e.g. by marital loans and prizes for large families); (2) limitation of breeding among the \x91unfit\x92 (especially by sterilization); and (3) prevention of exposure to genotoxic hazards. For Astel, preventive racial hygiene translated into a research effort to determine whether nicotine was a mutagen, in accordance with his view that \x91We cannot change our genes, but at least we can safeguard them from future damage.\x929\r\n\r\nAstel therefore funded inquiries into whether nicotine or other constituents of tobacco smoke could be considered mutagens. The racial theorist G\xfcnther Just of W\xfcrzburg's Rassenbiologisches Institut was appointed a \x91Mitarbeiter\x92 at the tobacco institute in March of 1943, and over the next 2 years received 6000 RM to explore the genetic and hormonal damage caused by nicotine. The pharmacologist Gustav Kuschinsky of Prague received a total of 17 444 RM that same year from Astel's institute, to conduct a series of rat experiments to prove (with Karl Thums of Prague) that smoking caused heritable genetic damage. Kuschinsky was still doing work on this project (without success) as late as September 1944; he also worked for the Reemtsma tobacco company after the war, doing similar work.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi government enacted numerous legal sanctions limiting tobacco use. Tobacco was banned in theatres and cinemas, and on buses and in many public buildings. Astel implemented the nation's first (modern) university tobacco ban, and smoking was barred in post offices, military hospitals, and all Nazi party offices. Rationing was implemented at the outbreak of the campaign against Poland, making it hard even for Astel's institute to obtain tobacco for research purposes. In 1942, for example, Astel had to ask his anti-tobacco comrade, Reich Health F\xfchrer Leonardo Conti, for help in obtaining adequate supplies.\r\n\r\nOne reason tobacco was in short supply was that tobacco was used to finance the war. In September 1942 a war tax nearly doubled the price of cigarettes, which when coupled with agricultural shortages and the impoverishment late in the war caused a drastic drop in the number of cigarettes smoked in Germany. Per capita cigarette consumption fell by half from 1940 to 1950, whereas in the US, per capita consumption doubled over the same period.\r\n\r\nHitler in 1942 said that he regretted having given his soldiers tobacco at the start of the war. And though the decision was clearly a pragmatic one, the power of tobacco manufacturers at this time should not be underestimated. The industry had strong friends in the ministries of economics and finance, both of which were clearly afraid of interrupting the steady flow of cash from tobacco taxes, which in 1941 accounted for one twelfth(!) of all revenues flowing into the national treasury. Anti-tobacco activists often lamented the financial clout of the industry, as we can see from the following passage in a letter of 21 April 1941, from Fritz Lickint to Astel, celebrating the founding of the anti-tobacco institute:\r\n\r\nFinally it will be possible to establish a true bulwark against efforts by the heretofore omnipotent \x91tobacco interests\x92 to monopolize tobacco research. Finally it will be possible to counter the impression, created by the industry's research institutes in Vienna and Forchheim, that they alone have the right to speak the truth about tobacco, and to shape or even dominate public opinion concerning matters of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe industry's voice was not so easily countered, however. Shortly after the founding of Astel's institute, the industry established its own information organ, the \x91Tabacologia medicinalis,\x92 in a clear attempt to win the tobacco-health propaganda war. Leonardo Conti ordered the closing of the organization shortly thereafter, but it is possible to see this as the beginning of a new kind of clash that would re-emerge in America in the mid-1950s, with the formation of the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, bodies skilfully designed to counter the evidence of a global tobacco health catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt was not the power of the tobacco industry that crushed Astel's institute, but rather the defeat of Germany's armies. The institute came to an end in the spring of 1945, when Astel committed suicide, recognizing his future in a post-Nazi world would not be a pleasant one. Astel had helped to organize the euthanasia operation that murdered some 200 000 mentally and physically disabled; he had also assisted in the \x91Final Solution of the Jewish Question\x92 as head of the Th\xfcringia's Office of Racial Affairs. Had he managed to survive the war, he most likely would have been tried as a war criminal. Astel had also made the Jena medical faculty a hotbed of Nazi activism\x97some instances of which can be seen in the highly questionable research promulgated under his reign.\r\n\r\nThe Waffen-SS physician Erich Wagner, for example, had done his notorious dissertation on classifying tattoos among the concentration camp inmates of Buchenwald under Astel's tutelage; Wagner committed suicide in 1959, when a court in Offenburg began legal proceedings against him for murder.10 Members of the Jena medical faculty had done other work at Buchenwald, some of which utilized their tobacco expertise. Friedrich Timm of Jena's Institute for Forensic Medicine, for example, autopsied the body of an SS Hauptscharf\xfchrer by the name of Rudolf K\xf6hler, who had died while interned in the camp on suspicion of corruption; Timm concluded that the man had committed suicide by ingesting a \x91large quantity of cigarette butts\x92. Astel's institute also entertained proposals to study how racial mixing, tobacco use, and \x91exploitation by Jewish capital interests\x92 affected the health of people living in tobacco-growing regions. Tobacco in the words of the author of this proposal was to be classified not as a Lebensmittel (food) but rather as a Sterbemittel (death agent).\r\n\r\nSome of the institute's work involved human experiments. The radiologist Wolf Dietrich von Keiser on 6 November 1941, for example, wrote to Astel, asking for his assistance in procuring 400 stormtroopers for a series of experiments to determine the effects of nicotine on gastric function. The subjects were required to appear for 2 days in Keiser's surgical clinic at the University of Jena; one day they were fed nicotine, the other they were not. The men were then X-rayed to determine effects on the stomach. Human experiments were also carried out on prisoners, and there was a fair amount of animal experimentation.\r\n\r\nNormal science?\r\n\r\nSchairer and Sch\xf6niger's work on tobacco and lung cancer is of interest, among other things, for what it tells us about the fate of science in a totalitarian dictatorship. For one thing, it shows that certain kinds of science can actually flourish, if they are not seen as contrary to the ideological goals of such a state. Had Germany won the war, one can imagine that Astel's institute would have continued producing sophisticated science; as it was the institute was formally dissolved in November 1945, when Russian military authorities confiscated the funds of Jena's Th\xfcringische Staatsbank.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another interesting element to this story, which is that the paper translated here was by and large ignored by post-war scientists. The Science Citation Index reveals that the paper was cited three or four times in the 1960s, only once in the 1970s, and then not again until 1988, when Ernst Wynder cited it in an article in Public Health Reports. The paper was unknown even in Germany, where one might have expected more sympathetic treatment. A 1953 German-language bibliography devoted exclusively to the topic of \x91Tobacco and Cancer\x92 does not include Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's article.11 Even today, Germans tend to present the history of tobacco/cancer research as if it were entirely an Anglo-American affair, ignoring local contributions. The fear may be that by acknowledging such a work, one might somehow give credence to Nazis ideals or policy. The conventional view seems to be that Nazism gave birth only to monsters, and that anything with roots in this era must be tainted.\r\n\r\nThere are other areas of biomedical science where similar views held sway. James Watson in his book, The Double Helix, tells the story of how Gerhard Schramm's subtle studies on viral biochemistry were ignored or dismissed by post-war scientists, thinking that good work simply could not have been done by Nazi scientists12 (Schramm was a member of the SS and a key figure in Adolf Butenandt's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry). Similar prejudices may have been at play with regard to German tobacco work\x97though language barriers may also have played a role. Many wartime-era German journals were never shipped abroad, a casualty of the disintegration of international co-operation, but also a result of subscription cutbacks, communications breakdowns, and the boycott of German journals by several professional groups in Allied nations.\r\n\r\nTobacco epidemiology was also not the kind of thing Allied military authorities were interested in, when they began to comb through German science and engineering in search of exploitable findings. No effort was made to exploit Germany's pioneering tobacco work, e.g. in the FIAT reviews of German science, a veritable Encyclopedia Naziana published shortly after the war by US and British military authorities. The focus was rather on sciences that might prove of \x91strategic\x92 interest\x97defined in military terms. There is an interesting irony here, insofar as rocket bombs and aerotechnical engineering skills were exploited\x97often to the point of kidnapping and transferring the scientists themselves abroad\x97when sciences that could have clearly helped save lives were ignored. US priorities in this area became clear when an effort was launched to resupply Germany with tobacco. In 1948 and 1949, the US shipped 93 000 tons of blond Virginia-blend tobacco free of charge to the defeated nation as part of the Marshall Plan.13\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may end with a speculation, that the net effect of the Nazi war on tobacco\x97and I am talking only about Germany here\x97was actually to forestall the development of effective anti-tobacco measures by several decades. Nazi ideals seem to have helped foster some world-class tobacco science (think also of Franz M\xfcller's paper, which actually came to stronger conclusions than Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's),14 but they ultimately dragged it down, both by destroying the German economy and by tainting Nazi-era research with some of history's most inhumane policies. In the post-war era, memories of Nazi-endorsed asceticism were not exactly pleasant ones. Nor did tobacco control fit very well with the consumerist urges of the 1950s or the more carefree bacchanalian ethics of the late 1960s and 1970s. Germany today has one of Europe's worst records in the area of tobacco control, despite being home to some of the world's first tobacco epidemiology. European and American tobacco companies have both tried to play the Nazi card, associating smoking restrictions with Nazi-like policings.15\r\n\r\nOne of the jobs of the science historian, however, is to explore how strange and unexpected historical forces can influence the flourishing (or stifling) of science. The resurrection of this pioneering paper will hopefully throw new light on a largely forgotten chapter of tobacco science, and the curious political circumstances in which it arose.""",3
"b'A new analytical approach based on capillary electrophoresis-electrospray mass spectrometry (CE/ESI-MS) has provided new insight into the characterization of mannooligosaccharide caps from lipoarabinomannans (LAMs), which are key molecules in the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis. This analytical approach requires oligosaccharide labeling with the fluorophore 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate (APTS) by reductive amination at the reducing termini. Optimization of the separation and ionization conditions, such as the choice of capillary electrophoresis (CE) electrolyte buffers, is presented and discussed. Anionic separation of the mono and oligosaccharide APTS derivatives was finally achieved with aqueous triethylammonium formate buffer. It was found that in contrast to the triethylammonium phosphate buffer, the triethylammonium formate buffer was appropriate for CE/ESI-MS coupling analysis of APTS-carbohydrate derivatives. In this case, negative ESI-mass spectra of APTS-carbohydrate adducts showed mainly (M-2H)2- pseudomolecular ions and some sequence fragment ions allowing their non-ambiguous structural characterization at the picomolar level. This analytical approach was successfully applied to more complex mixtures of carbohydrates released by mild acid hydrolysis of the lipoarabinomannans from Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The APTS-mannooligosaccharide cap adducts were separated by CE and their structural characterization achieved by CE/ESI-MS analyses. Mannooligosaccharide caps were routinely analyzed by capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) from 50 fmol of lipoarabinomannans with mannosyl capping (ManLAMs) but sensitivity was about 50 times lower using ESI-MS detection.'",2
"b'Previous research has demonstrated that alcohol impairs information processing. However, it is unknown whether this impairment is on all stages of information processing, or on the early, rather than on the later, stages of information processing. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of orally administered alcohol on both the early and the later stages of information processing. The present study assessed inspection time (IT), simple reaction time, choice reaction time and cognitive ability (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \x97 Revised) in 16 adult participants in both alcohol and placebo conditions. IT (a measure of the early stages of information processing) was used as a predictor variable in a linear regression to examine whether a disruption of the early stages of information processing accounted for changes in total information processing after alcohol administration. Results indicated that alcohol significantly slowed total information processing, independently of the early stages of information processing.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'A full-length c-DNA encoding a xyloglucan-specific endo-[beta]-1,4-glucanase (XEG) has been isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus by expression cloning in yeast. The colonies expressing functional XEG were identified on agar plates containing azurine-dyed cross-linked xyloglucan. The cDNA encoding XEG was isolated, sequenced, cloned into an Aspergillus expression vector, and transformed into Aspergillus oryzae for heterologous expression. The recombinant enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The recombinant XEG has a molecular mass of 23,600, an isoelectric point of 3.4, and is optimally stable at a pH of 3.4 and temperature below 30\xb0C. The enzyme hydrolyzes structurally diverse xyloglucans from various sources, but hydrolyzes no other cell wall component and can therefore be considered a xyloglucan-specific endo-[beta]-1,4-glucanohydrolase. XEG hydrolyzes its substrates with retention of the anomeric configuration. The Km of the recombinant enzyme is 3.6 mg/ml, and its specific activity is 260 \xb5mol/min per mg protein. The enzyme was tested for its ability to solubilize xyloglucan oligosaccharides from plant cell walls. It was shown that treatment of plant cell walls with XEG yields only xyloglucan oligosaccharides, indicating that this enzyme can be a powerful tool in the structural elucidation of xyloglucans.'",2
"b""Sir\x97In their interesting study Bennett et al. demonstrated that circumcision is a risk factor for neonatal tetanus (NNT) in Punjab Province, Pakistan.1 They also showed that the use of topical antibiotics on the circumcision wound decreased the risk of NNT to the same level observed in babies who were not circumcised. Based on these findings Bennett et al. suggest that topical antibiotics should be routinely applied to every circumcision wound, and add that topical application of other substances commonly used in the region should be avoided. I would like to comment on these recommendations.\r\n\r\nOne of Bradford-Hill's well-known criteria used for assessing a hypothesized causal relationship is biological plausibility.2 When an association is plausible the hypothesis is usually more acceptable. In the assessment of the protective effect against NNT of topical antibiotics used in the circumcision wound it is important to know whether topical antibiotics inactivate Clostridium tetani spores or, more likely, vegetative forms, or if there are alternative mechanisms that explain why the use of such ointments would prevent this disease. Among the several topical antibiotics at least bacitracin is active against clostridia, and has also been shown to enhance epidermal healing of wounds.3 This makes the observed protective effect of topical antibiotics on circumcision-associated NNT plausible, when the ointments used contained this antibiotic. However it is also possible that the use of topical antibiotics is just an indicator of good wound care. In such cases caregivers who used topical antibiotics in the circumcision wounds of their babies did it instead of using dung, ghee, urine etc, which explains why the babies did not get NNT.\r\n\r\nAdjustment for use on the circumcision wound of the above-mentioned substances was apparently not done in the multivariate analysis. It would be interesting to know whether the use on the circumcision wound of dung and other substances likely to be contaminated with tetanus spores could have confounded the observed protective effect of local antibiotics in preventing NNT. I would not be surprised if these variables were highly negatively correlated to each other, i.e. those individuals who used topical antibiotics did not use dung in the circumcision wound, and vice-versa. Even if the correlation is not as high as I expect, analysis of a possible interaction between these variables would also be of interest. In which case my bet would be that those who used dung plus topical antibiotics had a higher risk of NNT than those who used only antibiotics.\r\n\r\nIf the use of topical antibiotics is only an indicator that wounds are kept clean and free of tetanus spores, what would be the best advice for health care workers involved in neonatal care in Punjab Province? Education of the population to not use substances that could contaminate the wound is an obvious solution that might not be easy to execute, at least in the short term. Dr Bennett et al. are familiar with the region and the local culture, so their recommendation to promote the topical use of antibiotics deserves respect. It may be the best short-term solution as it might decrease the use of dung and other substances rich in tetanus spores. On the other hand it would increase cost, create false expectations as to the effectiveness of antibiotic ointments, and increase the risk of side effects associated with the use of topical antibiotics.3 Promoting the use of ointments containing only antiseptics is an alternative that deserves consideration.""",3
"b'To understand neuronal mechanisms for manipulating and/or integrating information in working memory processes, we examined functional interactions among prefrontal neurons exhibiting various task-related activities by cross-correlation analysis. Among 168 neuron pairs isolated, 84 (50%) had significant peaks in cross-correlograms (CCGs); 30 had excitatory central peaks at time 0, 38 had excitatory peaks displaced from time 0, 13 had inhibitory central peaks, and three had both excitatory and inhibitory peaks displaced from time 0. Although significant interactions were observed among prefrontal neurons having various task-related activities, the information flow is present from prefrontal neurons having cue-period activity to neurons having oculomotor activity through neurons having delay-period activity. In addition, neuron pairs both having delay-period activity tended to have significant excitatory peaks in CCGs. Further, neuron pairs that had excitatory central peaks in CCGs tended to have similar directional preferences in task-related activities, and this similarity was the highest in neuron pairs both having cue-period activity. Neuron pairs that had displaced peaks in CCGs also showed similarity in directional preferences in task-related activities, and this similarity was also higher in neuron pairs both having cue-period activity. Interactions between neurons exhibiting task-related activity with different directional preferences increase as the temporal sequence of the task progresses. These results suggest that these interactions play an important role for manipulating and integrating information.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Zielhuis and Lambertus1 are asking us to draw a boundary around epidemiology that includes only so called \x91biological\x92 determinants of disease. They invoke no clear justification or claim any advantage for so doing. Needless to say their argument seems to assume that biology is scientific and that the social sciences like sociology and psychology are not, and they also implicitly connect biology with medicine. This is a normal part of a sloppy argument. Public health in the UK is currently likewise professionally protected for doctors, and hence it has come to be synonymous with public health medicine. Then the illegitimate protection is self-justified and the dominant protectors of the boundaries (the BMA in this case) no longer need to justify them, except when challenged.\r\n\r\nI believe we must resist (or simply ignore) this derivative proposal for similar reasons. Epidemiology is understanding the systematic determination of ill health by time, place and person. Firstly, it is the study of causes and determinants of disease and as such it must allow specialization within its boundaries to study, with enthusiasm, any plausible set of determinants. Secondly, most determinants interact in complicated ways, so even without specializing in social causes every epidemiologist must surely understand the rudiments of their potential effect. To exclude these experts by assigning them necessarily to another enterprise is simply stupid. To describe an epidemiologist who confronts questions from sociology as \x91merely a technician\x92 describes precisely why.\r\n\r\nWhat, moreover, is the point of attempting to exclude parts of the complex epidemiological landscape? I believe this argument is grounded in an elitist agenda (just like UK public health medicine currently is). All such elitist agendas must have, at the very least, a clear net benefit for the purpose of epidemiology, and in this case no such benefit can be possible. The single argument proposed in favour is that \x91shopping in neighbouring scientific fields\x92 invites inexpert interpretation. Well not necessarily! The solution is not to ban such progress but to require appropriate knowledge to enable people to make progress. After all the \x91social\x92 component of human immunodeficiency virus, of coronary heart disease and of most cancers is palpable and germane, but complex. The psychological component is less obvious possibly because we have all kept it on the periphery of our concerns. We should instead be encouraging rigorous and systematic study from knowledgeable specialists to advance this understanding too. To tell the best psychologists that they have no place in the epidemiological enterprise can only be justified by evidence, and these authors have none.\r\n\r\nThese proposals are therefore just silly! Worse, they invite further disparagement and scientific neglect of important areas. For what scientific purpose I simply cannot discern from their article.'",3
"b""Hippocampal function was analysed by making recordings from hippocampal neurons in monkeys actively walking in the laboratory. `Spatial view' cells, which respond when the monkey looks at a part of the environment, were analysed. It is shown that these cells code for the allocentric position in space being viewed and not for eye position, head direction or the place where the monkey is located. This representation of space `out there' would be an appropriate part of a primate memory system involved in memories of where in an environment an object was seen, and more generally in the memory of particular events or episodes, for which a spatial component normally provides part of the context.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'The electrophysiological nature of dopamine actions has been controversial for years, with data supporting both inhibitory and excitatory actions. In this study, we tested whether stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the source of the dopamine innervation of the prefrontal cortex, would exert different responses depending on the membrane potential states that pyramidal neurons exhibit when recorded in vivo, and whether VTA stimulation would have a role in controlling transitions between these states. Prefrontal cortical neurons have a very negative resting membrane potential (down state) interrupted by plateau depolarizations (up state). Although the up state had been shown to be dependent on hippocampal afferents in nucleus accumbens neurons, our results indicate that neither hippocampal nor thalamic inputs are sufficient to drive up events in prefrontal cortical neurons. Electrical VTA stimulation resulted in a variety of actions, in many cases depending on the neuron membrane potential state. Trains of stimuli resembling burst firing evoked a long-lasting transition to the up state, an effect blocked by a D1 antagonist and mimicked by chemical VTA stimulation. These results indicate that projections from the VTA to the prefrontal cortex may be involved in controlling membrane potential states that define assemblies of activable pyramidal neurons in this region.'",1
"b'The orbitofrontal cortex has been ascribed a role in the inhibitory control, as well as in the emotional control, of behaviour. While damage to the orbitofrontal cortex in humans and non-human primates can cause inflexibility, impulsiveness and emotional disturbance, the relationship between these effects are unclear. Excitotoxic lesion studies in marmosets comparing the effects of cell loss within specific regions of the prefrontal cortex on performance of a range of behavioural tests reveal that mechanisms of response inhibition are not unique to the orbitofrontal cortex. Instead they are present in distinct cognitive domains for lowerorder as well as higher-order processing throughout the prefrontal cortex. Thus, the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection and control of action based upon higher-order rules while the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex may be involved in different but complementary forms of lower-order rule learning, their roles dissociable, as a result of their differential contribution to different types of associative learning.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'IL-18 is an IL-1-related cytokine which shares biological functions with IL-12. These include the activation of NK cells, induction of IFN-{gamma} production and Th1 cell differentiation. In this study we analyzed the effect of IL-18 deficiency on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury and endotoxin shock in Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice. P. acnes-primed IL-18-deficient (IL-18KO) mice showed resistance to LPS-induced liver injury. Unexpectedly, P. acnes-primed IL-18KO mice were highly susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxin shock. Serum level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} were markedly elevated (~10-fold higher) within 1.5 h after LPS challenge in IL-18KO mice as compared with wild-type mice. Anti-TNF-{alpha} antibody administration to IL-18KO mice was significantly protective against endotoxin-induced lethality. P. acnes-primed IL-18KO macrophages produced ~6-fold more TNF-{alpha} protein than did P. acnes-primed wild-type control macrophages. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-18 is responsible for the progression of endotoxin-induced liver injury as well as down-regulation of endotoxin-induced TNF-{alpha} production in P. acnes-primed mice.'",4
"b""We have previously reported that B cells that are activated by multivalent but not bivalent membrane Ig cross-linking ligands synergize with various B cell activators culminating in enhanced B cell proliferation. In this study we asked whether B cells that are activated by a multivalent mIg cross-linking agonist could respond to oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing non-stimulatory motifs. Earlier reports have shown that ODN containing a CpG motif in which the cytosine is unmethylated and is flanked by two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines induce high levels of B cell activation, while ODN whose CpG are methylated or flanked by sequences other than the optimal two 5' purines and two 3' pyrimidines were non-stimulatory. In this manuscript we show that when B cells are stimulated in vitro with dextran-conjugated anti-IgD antibodies (anti-IgD\x96dex), as the multivalent mIg ligand, their proliferation is enhanced and they can be induced to secrete Ig in response to ODN containing various non-optimal motifs, both methylated and non-methylated. Furthermore we could induce synergistic levels of proliferation with concentrations of anti-IgD\x96dex that were in the picomolar concentration range and with concentrations of ODN that were 10- to 100-fold less than previously reported to be necessary for mitogenic activity. These data provided a model to explain how low concentrations of a multi-epitope-expressing microorganism in the context of mammalian (methylated) or microorganism (non-methylated) DNA can lead to dysregulated B cell proliferation and Ig secretion.""",4

Thus, the two kinds of carbohydrate molecules are expressed on the plasma membrane of boar sperm depending on their physiological state.

We have shown that processing of exogenous but not endogenous HBsAg generates the Kb-binding S208\x96215 peptide ILSPFLPL. This system allowed us to optimize conditions for stimulating murine CTL responses to exogenous antigen by identifying adjuvants that facilitate priming of Kb-restricted CTL by injecting recombinant HBsAg particles into `low responder' H-2b mice. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides with immunostimulating sequences or the recombinant cytokine IL-12 efficiently enhanced priming of CTL to exogenous HBsAg. Hence, the adjuvanticity of DNA sequences that induce Th1 cytokines facilitate priming of MHC I-restricted T cell responses to exogenous antigen and are therefore of potential value in formulating vaccines designed to enhance CTL priming to exogenous antigen.""",4
"b""Speech perception requires cortical mechanisms capable of analysing and encoding successive spectral (frequency) changes in the acoustic signal. To study temporal speech processing in the human auditory cortex, we recorded intracerebral evoked potentials to syllables in right and left human auditory cortices including Heschl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT) and the posterior part of superior temporal gyrus (area 22). Natural voiced (/ba/, /da/, /ga/) and voiceless (/pa/, /ta/, /ka/) syllables, spoken by a native French speaker, were used to study the processing of a specific temporally based acoustico-phonetic feature, the voice onset time (VOT). This acoustic feature is present in nearly all languages, and it is the VOT that provides the basis for the perceptual distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants. The present results show a lateralized processing of acoustic elements of syllables. First, processing of voiced and voiceless syllables is distinct in the left, but not in the right HG and PT. Second, only the evoked potentials in the left HG, and to a lesser extent in PT, reflect a sequential processing of the different components of the syllables. Third, we show that this acoustic temporal processing is not limited to speech sounds but applies also to non-verbal sounds mimicking the temporal structure of the syllable. Fourth, there was no difference between responses to voiced and voiceless syllables in either left or right areas 22. Our data suggest that a single mechanism in the auditory cortex, involved in general (not only speech-specific) temporal processing, may underlie the further processing of verbal (and non-verbal) stimuli. This coding, bilaterally localized in auditory cortex in animals, takes place specifically in the left HG in man. A defect of this mechanism could account for hearing discrimination impairments associated with language disorders.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b""Previous studies have shown that hST3Gal I mRNA is overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues and primary breast carcinoma compared with nonmalignant or benign tissue, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of hST3Gal I gene is altered during malignant transformation. We report transcriptional regulation of the hST3Gal I gene in colon adenocarcinoma and leukemia cell lines. To determine the genomic structure of the 5'-untranslated region, we cloned and identified the 5'-untranslated region of hST3Gal I from a human genome library. The 5'-untranslated region was found to be divided into three exons, namely, exons Y, X, and C1. The transcription initiation sites map at \x961035 bp from the translation initiation site. Our results indicate that the transcriptional regulation of hST3Gal I depends on the pI promoter that exists 5'-upstream of exon Y in these cell lines. The results of luciferase assay suggest that the nt \x96304 to \x96145 region is important for transcriptional activity of hST3Gal I gene in both cell lines. The nt \x96304 to \x96145 region contains two sequences similar to the Sp1 recognition elements (GC-box) and one USF binding site. The results of site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the Sp1 binding sites and USF binding site of the pI promoter are involved in the transcription of hST3Gal I mRNA. However, the triple mutant of these sites still exhibits about 50% transcriptional activity, suggesting that there are other transcription factors involved in the transcription of hST3Gal I mRNA. These results suggest that these factors may play a critical role in the up-regulation of the hST3Gal I gene during malignant transformation.""",2
"b'We have demonstrated a stable expansion of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of a child with chronic arthritis. The expanded TCRBV family (TCRBV14) was enriched for CD57hiCD28\x96 T cells. Sequencing of the TCRBV14 amplification products showed a TCR sequence which contributed 32% of the total TCR in the CD8+TCRBV14 population. Using the modified heteroduplex technique, the CD8+TCRBV14 cells showed a clonal pattern and these bands were restricted to the CD28\x96 population. This method also detected multiple other clones within the CD8+ population but few in the CD4+ cells. The dominant TCRBV14+ clone was not detectable in synovial fluid T cells from two inflamed joints by CDR3 length analysis or heteroduplex probing, suggesting that this long-lived clone is excluded from inflammatory sites. Synovial fluid T cells showed an unexpected discordance of the CD28 and CD57 phenotype compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T cells from both inflamed joints both showed marked oligoclonality in all TCR families and had almost identical heteroduplex patterns. Taken together these data suggest that some clones are actively excluded from inflamed sites in juvenile chronic arthritis, yet the pattern of restricted T cell expansion is shared between sites of inflammation.'",4
"b""Isabella Leitch was a remarkable woman. I came to realise this soon after I started work at the Rowett Research Institute in September 1937 where I had been appointed to carry out the clinical examinations of the children in the Boyd Orr survey. My colleague, the late Angus Thomson, and I frequently sought her advice, which was often blunt but always helpful.\r\n\r\nIsabella Leitch had spent the 1914\x9618 war carrying out research in genetics and plant physiology at Copenhagen University with Prof. A Krogh, a Nobel prize winner in medicine, and she had obtained her DSc at Aberdeen University in 1919 on the basis of published and unpublished papers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that she was, by then, an experienced research worker, she was unable to find a research post in Aberdeen. At length, in 1923, she found a job as temporary librarian at the Rowett Research Institute.1\r\n\r\nShe soon found herself involved in various research programmes, first in animal nutrition and later, when the Institute became involved in human nutrition, in that area too. Her encyclopaedic knowledge and sharp critical mind made her a key figure and she became adviser and personal assistant to the director, John Boyd Orr.\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, the signs of specific nutritional diseases such as scurvy, rickets and pellagra, were well known, but there was little agreement on the early symptoms and signs of malnutrition. Certain changes in the skin, anaemia, defective night vision, increased frequency of infections and slower rates of growth were suspected to be signs of malnutrition and we looked for these.\r\n\r\nAngus Thomson and I often consulted Dr Leitch (as we always called her), and she was able to give us valuable advice on what was worth looking for and measuring in the children we were going to examine. One such piece of advice she gave us, which has turned out to be very significant, was to measure leg length as well as total height.\r\n\r\nThe Boyd Orr survey was completed in July 1939 but, because of the outbreak of war in September and the dispersal of most of the research workers, the full results were not published until 1955.2\r\n\r\nA few papers on specific aspects of the survey were published before this. One of these was Isabella Leitch's paper on growth.3 In this she drew attention, among other things, to a finding from the survey that the \x91longer legged children suffered less bronchitis than the shorter legged at all ages\x92.\r\n\r\nAlthough I occasionally experienced her severe criticism, as when she returned the draft of an article I was proposing to send to The Lancet blue pencilled all over, I remember her with respect and affection.

"b'We read with interest the study reported by Kerai et al. in the July\x96August (1999) issue of Alcohol and Alcoholism. The authors concluded that hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation caused by chronic alcohol consumption in rats can be reversed by administration of taurine. Furthermore, an increased urine excretion of homocysteine during alcohol withdrawal was found. Recently, it has been shown that chronic alcoholism is associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia (Hultberg et al., 1993Go; Cravo et al., 1996Go). Hyperhomocysteinaemia was observed in chronic alcoholics who underwent withdrawal from alcohol (Bleich et al., 1999Go), whereas no significant changes of taurine concentrations in alcohol-dependent patients were observed (Badawy et al., 1998Go). It has been suggested that withdrawal symptomatology could result from increased activity of excitatory mechanisms (e.g. NMDA receptor) and from reduced functioning of inhibitory receptors (e.g. GABAA receptor) and it has been shown that chronic treatment with ethanol leads to an increase of the NMDA receptor number at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Grant et al., 1990Go). In addition to the excitatory role played by the amino acid transmitters glutamate and aspartate in the central nervous system, their sulphur-containing analogues homocysteic acid (HCA) and cysteine sulphinic acid (CSA) may also play a similar role. These latter compounds are oxidation products of homocysteine and cysteine, are putative neurotransmitters and are endogenous agonists at the NMDA receptor, a subtype of the glutamate receptor (Cuenod et al., 1990Go). In addition, it has been shown that homocysteine itself acts as an agonist at the glutamate binding site of the NMDA receptor (Lipton et al., 1997Go), whereas taurine and hypotaurine may act as inhibitory transmitters (Saransaari and Oja, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nIn summary, in the metabolic pathway from methionine to taurine and in its branch pathways, excitatory sulphur-containing amino acids are formed. There is growing evidence that chronic alcoholism is associated with a derangement in the sulphur amino acid metabolism. Ethanol-induced hyperhomocysteinaemia with subsequent accumulation of the excitatory neurotransmitters may partly mediate the variety of symptoms which are seen in alcohol withdrawal. Hyperhomocysteinaemia is a treatable condition taking into account that folate therapy will reliably reduce plasma homocysteine levels. Furthermore, the administration of taurine or taurine-like agents acting as inhibitory neurotransmitters might be beneficial in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal. In conclusion, taurine appears to be useful in ameliorating ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and could also be effective against alcohol-withdrawal symptomatology. Furthermore, the inhibitory amino acid taurine may constitute an important protective mechanism against excitotoxicity, which leads to neuronal damage. Further investigations and controlled studies are therefore needed to clarify the role of homocysteine and taurine in patients with alcoholism.'",0
"b'Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain why immune responses against human tumor antigens are generally ineffective. For example, tumor cells have been shown to develop active immune evasion mechanisms. Another possibility is that tumor antigens are unable to optimally stimulate tumor-specific T cells. In this study we have used HLA-A2/Melan-A peptide tetramers to directly isolate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes. This allowed us to quantify the activation requirements of a representative polyclonal yet monospecific tumor-reactive T cell population. The results obtained from quantitative assays of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, TCR down-regulation, cytokine production and induction of effector cell differentiation indicate that the naturally produced Melan-A peptides are weak agonists and are clearly suboptimal for T cell activation. In contrast, optimal T cell activation was obtained by stimulation with recently defined peptide analogues. These findings provide a molecular basis for the low immunogenicity of tumor cells and suggest that patient immunization with full agonist peptide analogues may be essential for stimulation and maintenance of anti-tumor T cell responses in vivo.'",4
"b'Prevalence estimates of alcohol abuse or dependence in general hospitals are often limited to single wards, small data collecting periods or insufficient diagnostic procedures. Therefore, the present study aimed to ascertain alcohol abuse or dependence in one general hospital, to compare prevalence data for all the 11 wards and 6 intake months, to establish if screening is sufficient or if a two-step diagnostic procedure is needed, and to determine whether information for an alcohol diagnosis on suspicion is available. A sample of 1309 medical or surgical in-patients were screened by questionnaires or medication for withdrawal, and, if screening-positive, were interviewed with the alcohol section of a standardized psychiatric interview. In screening-negative patients, a diagnosis on suspicion was given if medication to treat withdrawal had been used, or if there was evidence of single criteria of alcohol dependence, somatic disorders from alcohol drinking, raised laboratory parameters on grounds of alcohol drinking or of self-reported high alcohol consumption. Of the medical and surgical in-patients, 20.7 and 16.0% respectively were alcohol abusers or dependants, with a range of prevalence rates of alcohol abuse or dependence among wards of 11.1\x9632.9% and among intake months between 11.3 and 28.7%. Of the medical department in-patients, 1.9%, and of the surgical in-patients, 2.1%, were screened as false-positive cases. In addition, 5.5% of the medical and 12.0% of the surgical patients were given a diagnosis on suspicion. It is concluded that all general wards and different intake months should be taken into account when estimating prevalence of alcohol abuse or dependence in a general hospital.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the cortical bases of 3-D structure perception from visual motion in human. Nine subjects underwent three experiments designed to locate the areas involved in (i) motion processing (random motion versus static dots), (ii) coherent motion processing (expansion/ contraction versus random motion) and (iii) 3-D shape from motion reconstruction (3-D surface oscillating in depth versus random motion). Two control experiments tested the specific influence of speed distribution and surface curvature on the activation results. All stimuli consisted of random dots so that motion parallax was the only cue available for 3-D shape perception. As expected, random motion compared with static dots induced strong activity in areas V1/V2, V5+ and the superior occipital gyrus (SOG; presumptive V3/V3A). V1/V2 and V5+ showed no activity increase when comparing coherent motion (expansion or 3-D surface) with random motion. Conversely, V3/V3A and the dorsal parieto-occipital junction were highlighted in both comparisons and showed gradually increased activity for random motion, coherent motion and a curved surface rotating in depth, which suggests their involvement in the coding of 3-D shape from motion. Also, the ventral aspect of the left occipito-temporal junction was found to be equally responsive to random and coherent motion stimuli, but showed a specific sensitivity to curved 3-D surfaces compared with plane surfaces. As this region is already known to be involved in the coding of static object shape, our results suggest that it might integrate various cues for the perception of 3-D shape.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'In this study we present data on the entire population of MUC2 molecules secreted from and within the cell layer of an intestinal cell line. The molecular size distribution of the extracted molecules and their reactivity with two different MUC2 polypeptide antibodies indicated the presence of precursor and mature forms of the mucin. Oligomerized forms of the mucin were found in both the cell layer and medium; however, precursor forms were confined to the cell layer. Isopycnic density gradient centrifugation gave good resolution of mature and precursor forms of MUC2 as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Three different populations of MUC2 were identified: one at low density (>1.3 g/ml) containing the N-glycosylated, non-O-glycosylated polypeptide; a second at intermediate density (1.3-1.35 g/ml) which may represent partially O-glycosylated intermediates; and a third at high density (1.36-1.48 g/ml) containing the mature MUC2 mucins. Rate-zonal centrifugation and agarose electrophoretic analysis of the low-density fraction indicated that the N-glycosylated MUC2 polypeptide was present as putative monomer and dimer/oligomer species. The combination of isopycnic density gradient centrifugation with agarose electrophoresis provides a new and simple approach that allows us to follow the MUC2 gene product from polypeptide through to the mature glyco-sylated mucin.'",2
"b'Alcohol (ethanol) was administered chronically to female Sprague\x96Dawley rats in a nutritionally adequate, totally liquid diet for 28 days. This resulted in significant hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation. When taurine was administered for 2 days following alcohol withdrawal it was found to reduce alcohol-induced lipid peroxidation and completely reversed hepatic steatosis. The reversal of hepatic steatosis was demonstrated both biochemically and histologically. Two days following alcohol withdrawal, the apparent activity of the alcohol-inducible form of cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) was unchanged although total cytochrome P450 content was increased. In addition, alcohol significantly inhibited hepatic methionine synthase activity and increased homocysteine excretion in urine. Although alcohol did not affect the urinary excretion of taurine (a non-invasive marker of liver damage), levels of serum and hepatic taurine were markedly raised in animals given taurine following their treatment with alcohol, compared to animals given taurine alone. There was evidence of slight bile duct injury in animals treated with alcohol and with alcohol followed by taurine, as indicated by raised serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholesterol. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also slightly raised. The effects of taurine on reversing hepatic steatosis may be due to the enhanced secretion of hepatic triglycerides. It is suggested that increased bile flow as a result of taurine treatment may have contributed to the removal of lipid peroxides. These in-vivo findings demonstrate for the first time that hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation, occurring as a result of chronic alcohol consumption, can be reversed by administration of taurine to rats for 2 days.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The effect of serotonin (5-HT) on the release of glutamate was examined in pyramidal cells in layers II\x96VI of the frontal cortex. The intracellular recording electrode contained 1% biocytin so the neurons could later be visualized with an avidin-biotin peroxidase method. Pyramidal cells in layer V of the frontal cortex showed the greatest 5-HT-induced increase in both the frequency and amplitude of \x91spontaneous\x92 (non-electrically evoked) excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs). A small proportion of neurons in layer II/III showed an increase in EPSC frequency, whereas cells in layer VI showed no significant change in either EPSC frequency or amplitude. The physiological response to 5-HT mirrors the high density of 5-HT2A receptors in layer V, as well as the pattern of thalamic projections in frontal cortex. The specific induction of EPSCs in layer V neurons suggests that 5-HT preferentially modulates the output neurons of the frontal cortex.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""The sialyltransferase ST6Gal mediates the biosynthetic addition of sialic acid, via an {alpha}2,6 linkage, to the nonreducing end of terminal lactosamine structures. Transcription of the murine ST6Gal gene, Siat1, is regulated by the selective use of multiple promoters in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Here we report that Siat1 mRNA expression is dramatically elevated in lactating (relative to virgin) mouse mammary gland. The predominant ST6Gal mRNA species expressed in lactating mammary gland is a heretofore undocumented isoform containing a unique 5'-untranslated region originating from the mouse Siat1 genetic region, now defined as Exon L, residing 549-bp 5' of the previously characterized Exon X2. Thus, the novel ST6Gal mRNA form initiates transcription from the region designated as p4 and incorporates the unique sequence from Exon L in 5'-juxtaposition to commonly shared sequences encoded on Exon I to Exon VI. In contrast, cells derived from virgin mammary tissue expressed only the housekeeping mRNA form derived from p3, with Exon O sequence preceding Exons I\x96VI. The Exon L\x96containing, p4 class of mRNA was also not detected in a survey of eight other mouse tissues.\r\n\r\nPrevious reports have indicated a strong correlation between mammary cancers and elevated ST6Gal expression in rats and in human patients. However, we uncovered neither elevated expression of ST6Gal mRNA nor appearance of p4 class in mouse breast carcinomas experimentally induced by transformation with the polyoma-middle T oncogene. A number of established breast carcinoma cell lines were also examined, with ST6Gal mRNA and activity generally low. Moreover, with the exception of the Shionogi cell line, p4 class of ST6Gal mRNA was not expressed in any of the mouse breast carcinoma specimens examined.\r\n\r\nTaken together, our data indicate that murine ST6Gal induction during lactation is achieved by de novo recruitment of a normally silent promoter. Furthermore, the data provide no support for elevated Siat1 expression on the mRNA level in association with murine mammary gland carcinogenesis. With the single exception of the Shionogi cell line, the p3 class remains the predominant ST6Gal mRNA expressed in all other murine mammary carcinoma cells examined.""",2
"b'The postnatal development of ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in monkey visual cortex provides an exquisite model for studying mechanisms of experience-guided neuronal plasticity. While the presence of columns at birth in Old World monkeys is now well established, it remains unclear whether cortical neurons at this early stage are capable of modulating gene expression in response to changing sensory conditions. Using a set of monocular deprivation and stimulation protocols, we examined activity-driven expression of the immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-fos and zif268 during the critical period of development. We observed well-delineated patterns of ODCs produced by sensory regulation of both IEGs throughout the critical period, starting as early as the first postnatal day. The expression levels are similar in layers II/III, IVC and VI throughout development, with no selective decline in the thalamorecepient layer (layer IVC) of adult monkeys. A narrow strip of non-columnar c-Fos expression was observed at the border of layers IVC and V. Our results show that neurons in monkey visual cortex are equipped at birth with the molecular machinery for coupling sensory inputs to active genomic responses and that this responsivity extends throughout the critical period. The findings are discussed within the context of a possible role for IEGs in sensory-driven cortical plasticity during development.'",1
"b'Susceptible, but not resistant, strains of rodents immunized for induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) with the uveitogenic protein interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) exhibit a type 1 response at the time of disease expression. Here we investigate the evolution of this response using the prototypic EAU-susceptible and EAU-resistant mouse strains, B10.A and BALB/c. Disease severity and IRBP-specific responses (proliferation, cytokines and antibody isotypes) were evaluated 7, 14 and 21 days after uveitogenic immunization. B10.A mice initially exhibited an IgG1-dominated antibody response, and their lymph node cells produced IL-4 and IL-5 in addition to IFN-{gamma}. On day 14 and 21, however, the IgG2a isotype became predominant, and the primed lymph node cells produced mainly IFN-{gamma} and IL-12. B10.A mice developed EAU before day 14. BALB/c mice initially produced IL-12 and IFN-{gamma} in addition to IL-5, IL-4 and IL-10. At later time points IL-12 and IFN-{gamma} production diminished, and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 increased. An IgG1-dominated antibody response was maintained throughout. BALB/c mice failed to develop EAU even at day 21. Thus, both susceptible and resistant genotypes initially mount a balanced, type 0-like cytokine response to a uveitogenic challenge, that subsequently polarizes towards type 1 in the susceptible strain and towards type 2 in the resistant strain.'",4
"b'A study of bacterial surface oligosaccharides were investigated among different strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to correlate structural features essential for binding to the MAb 2C7. This epitope is widely expressed and conserved in gonococcal isolates, characteristics essential to an effective candidate vaccine antigen. Sample lipooligosaccharides (LOS), was prepared by a modification of the hot phenol-water method from which de-O-acetylated LOS and oligosaccharide (OS) components were analyzed by ES-MS-CID-MS and ES-MSn in a triple quadrupole and an ion trap mass spectrometer, respectively. Previously documented natural heterogeneity was apparent from both LOS and OS preparations which was admixed with fragments induced by hydrazine and mild acid treatment. Natural heterogeneity was limited to phosphorylation and antenni extensions to the [alpha]-chain. Mild acid hydrolysis to release OS also hydrolyzed the [beta](1->6) glycosidic linkage of lipid A. OS structures were determined by collisional and resonance excitation combined with MS and multistep MSn which provided sequence information from both neutral loss, and nonreducing terminal fragments. A comparison of OS structures, with earlier knowledge of MAb binding, enzyme treatment, and partial acid hydrolysis indicates a generic overlapping domain for 2C7 binding. Reoccurring structural features include a Hep[alpha](1->3)Hep[beta](1->5)KDO trisaccharide core branched on the nonreducing terminus (Hep-2) with an [alpha](1->2) linked GlcNAc ([gamma]-chain), and an [alpha]-linked lactose ([beta]-chain) residue.

"b'Thymic lymphoma development is a multistage process in which genetic and epigenetic events cooperate in the emergence of a malignant clone. The notion that signaling via TCR\x96ligand interactions plays a role in promoting the expansion of developing neoplastic clones is a matter of debate. To investigate this issue, we determined the TCR V\xdf repertoire of thymic lymphomas induced in AKR/J mice by either endogenous retroviruses or the carcinogen, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Both spontaneous and MNU-induced lymphomas displayed restricted V\xdf repertoires. However, whereas V\xdf6, V\xdf8 and V\xdf9 were expressed by a greater than expected frequency of MNU-induced lymphomas, V\xdf8, V\xdf7, V\xdf13 and V\xdf14 were over-represented on spontaneous lymphomas. The dissimilar TCR V\xdf profiles indicate that different endogenous ligands promote neoplastic clonal expansion in untreated and MNU-treated mice. Although the nature of these ligands is not clear, the lack of conservation in TCR \xdf chain CDR3 regions among lymphomas that express the same V\xdf segment suggests that endogenous superantigens (SAG), as opposed to conventional peptide ligands, are likely to be involved in the selection process. The biased representation of lymphomas expressing V\xdf6-, V\xdf7- and V\xdf9-containing TCRs that recognize endogenous SAG is consistent with this hypothesis. The finding that Bcl-2 is expressed at high levels in spontaneous and MNU-induced lymphomas suggests that preneoplastic thymocytes may be resistant to SAG-induced clonal deletion. A working model is presented in which preneoplastic clones expressing TCRs that recognize endogenous SAG are selectively expanded as a consequence of sustained TCR-mediated signaling.'",4
"b'Freezing injury to the cortical plate of rats induces cerebrocortical microgyria and, in males but not females, a shift toward greater numbers of small neurons in the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). The purpose of the current study was to examine a hormonal basis for this sex difference. Cross-sectional neuronal areas of the MGN were measured in male rats, untreated female rats and female rats treated perinatally with testosterone propionate, all of which had received either neonatal cortical freezing or sham injury. Both male and androgenized female rats with microgyria had significantly smaller MGN neurons when compared to their sham-operated counterparts, whereas untreated females with microgyria did not. These differences were also reflected in MGN neuronal size distribution: both male and androgenized female rats with microgyria had more small and fewer large neurons in their MGN in comparison to shams, while there was no difference in MGN neuronal size distribution between lesioned and sham females. These findings suggest that perinatal gonadal steroids mediate the sex difference in thalamic response to induction of microgyria in the rat cortex.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background Sufficient evidence has been accumulated to demonstrate the causal relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk. Therefore, the lung cancer risk of a country is supposedly determined by the amount of cigarettes consumed in the country, but this quantitative relationship has yet to be clarified at a national level.\r\n\r\nObjective To find the quantitative relationship between cigarette smoking and subsequent lung cancer risk at a national level.\r\n\r\nMethods The quantitative relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer mortality is formulated as a function of cumulative cigarette consumption. The formulae for ages 25\x9629 to 70\x9674 are estimated by examining the increment of the lung cancer death rate in relation to the unit increase in cumulative cigarette consumption in different birth cohorts. The validity of the quantitative relationships is then examined by comparing lung cancer deaths expected from the formulae with observed deaths in past studies.\r\n\r\nResults Cumulative cigarette consumption was found to have increased in later birth cohorts for all ages of males and females. The age-specific lung cancer death rates from 35\x9639 to 70\x9674 were found to increase in proportion to cumulative cigarette consumption. Comparison of the results with past studies showed good agreement.\r\n\r\nConclusion The change over time in the lung cancer death rate of males and females in Japan can be explained fairly well by the increase in cumulative cigarette consumption at the national level.'",3
"b'The cDNAs encoding two human homologs of the Xenopus oocyte lectin, XL35, were isolated from a small intestine cDNA library and termed HL-1 and HL-2. The deduced amino acid sequence of each homolog is about 60% identical and 80% similar to that of XL35, and none of these sequences contains the C-type lectin motif, although it is known that XL35 requires calcium for ligand binding. By Northern analysis, HL-1 transcripts are present at relatively high levels in heart, small intestine, colon, thymus, ovary, and testis. HL-2 transcripts, by contrast, are expressed only in small intestine. Immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal antibody produced against XL35 shows HL-1 protein to be localized exclusively in endothelial cells in colon, thymus, liver, and other tissues. Primary cultures of human aortic endothelial cells are positive for HL-1 expression by immunoblotting and by PCR analysis, but several other human cell types are not. HL-1 and -2 are both encoded at chromosome 1q23, the same locus that encodes the selectins.

We prepared point mutations of the motif, which is found in the sequence 352-VLWVDDDFV, and analyzed cells that stably expressed the mutated proteins. Whereas the folding of the mutated proteins was not seriously disrupted as judged by assembly into homodimers, Golgi localization, and secretion of a soluble form of the enzyme, exchange of the highly conserved aspartic acid residues at position 356 or 358 with alanine or asparagine reduced enzyme activity to background levels. In contrast, the D356E and D357N mutations retained weak activity, while the activity of V352A and W354A mutants was 167% and 24% that of wild-type enzyme, respectively. Despite the major effect of the DXD motif on enzymatic activity, nucleotide binding was not altered in the triple mutant D356N/D357N/D358N as revealed by binding to UDP-beads and labeling with the photoaffinity reagent, P3-(4-azidoanilido)uridine 5'-triphosphate (AAUTP). In summary, rather than being critical for nucleotide binding, this motif may function during catalysis in GM2 synthase, as has been proposed elsewhere for the SpsA glycosyltransferase based on its crystal structure.""",2

Therefore we determined whether polymorphisms in the genes for alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH3) or cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) predispose to the development of CP. Methods: DNA samples were obtained from 142 adult CP patients with hereditary (n = 21), alcoholic (n = 82) or idiopathic (n = 39) CP. DNA from 128 healthy controls and from 93 alcoholic controls was analysed for comparison. Patients and controls were all of Caucasian origin. Genetic polymorphisms in ADH3 and CYP2E1 were determined by PCR, followed by restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism analyses in all subjects. Results: The frequencies of ADH3 and CYP2E1 c1c2 genotypes did not differ between CP patients and alcoholic and healthy controls. However, a trend for a higher frequency of the CYP2E1 intron 6 D allele was demonstrated in patients with alcohol-induced CP, compared to that of healthy controls (OR = 3.03, 95%CI = 1.0\x969.1) or alcoholic controls (OR = 2.76, 95%CI = 0.9\x968.7). Conclusions: These data suggest that the presence of the CYP2E1 intron 6 DD genotype might confer a higher risk of alcoholic CP.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The detailed structures of N-glycans derived from bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL) found in human milk were determined by combining exoglycosidase digestion with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The N-glycan structures were conclusively determined in terms of complexity and degree of fucosylation. Ion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection, together with mass-spectral analysis of the esterified N-glycans, indicated the presence of monosialylated structures. The molecular mass profile of esterified N-glycans present in BSSL further permitted the more detailed studies through collision-induced dissociation (CID) and sequential exoglycosidase cleavages. The N-glycan structures were elucidated to be complex/dibranched, fucosylated/complex/dibranched, monosialylated/complex/dibranched, and monosialylated/fucosylated/dibranched entities.'",2
"b'Background To investigate social variation in birthweight and length of gestation in Estonia in the period of transition to a democracy and market economy.\r\n\r\nMethods All live births resulting from singleton pregnancies reported to the Estonian Medical Birth Registry in 1992\x961997 (n = 84 629) were studied with respect to social variation in birthweight and preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). The results were adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, nationality, marital status, smoking in pregnancy, sex of the infant (and gestational age).\r\n\r\nResults Between 1992 and 1997, mean birthweight increased from 3465 g to 3497 g (P < 0.001) and the preterm rate fell from 5.8% to 5.1% (P = 0.001). Maternal education, marital status and nationality were all independently related to the mean birthweight and the risk of preterm birth. The mean difference in birthweight between children of mothers with basic and university education was 87 g (95% CI : 74\x96100). Children born to mothers of non-Estonian compared to Estonian nationality were on average 77 g lighter (95% CI : 70\x9684). While the effect of nationality and marital status on birthweight was relatively stable during the study period, differences in birth outcome by maternal education became stronger.\r\n\r\nConclusions The mean birthweight increased and the preterm rate decreased in Estonia as a whole during the transition. However, the improvements were not shared equally by all social groups. An increase in variation in birthweight by maternal education was particularly notable.'",3
"b'Spatio-temporal processing of whisker information was analysed in vivo for single neurons in D2 barrel columns of S1 cortex in Tg8 mutant mice, which lack barrels. Findings were compared with normal C3H mice of the same genetic background. The topographical organization of functional columns was similar in Tg8 and normal mice. Response magnitudes (RMs) to D2 principal whisker deflections in D2 columns for Tg8 were similar to normals for layers I\x96III and layer IV cells but short latency responses (>10 ms post-stimulus) were twice the magnitude of normal mice. The surrounding whiskers D1 and D3 yielded smaller RMs in layer IV of mutants than normal mice whereas RMs in layers I\x96III were equipotent (P > 0.5). Modal latencies were shorter in Tg8 mice in all layers. Latency distributions for whisker D2 responses in both laminae were bimodal in normal mice, peaking at 6\x968 and 12 ms post-stimulus, but unimodal in Tg8 mice in both laminae, peaking at 6 8 ms. Hence, despite an absence of barrels, segregation of columns is enhanced in layer IV and sensory processing is faster in layers I\x96IV compared with normal mice. This contrasts with adenylyl cyclase knockout mice where both an absence of barrels and enhanced surrounding whisker responses have been observed. These findings suggest that factors other than barrels and clustering of thalamo-cortical terminals define receptive field geometry.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Expression mechanism of CD15s (sialyl-Lex, sLex) antigen has been investigated using human B lymphoid cell lines. sLex structures were not expressed in mature B lymphoids but highly expressed in pre-B leukemia and pre-B lymphoma cell lines. The expression site was mainly on the O-linked oligosaccharide chains and E-selectin mediated-cell adhesion capability of sLex-positive cells were significantly suppressed by benzyl-[alpha]-GalNAc treatment. Subsequently, the bases of the sLex expression control mechanism were examined at the levels of enzymatic activities and transcripts of glycosyltransferases. (1) The activities of [alpha]1->3fucosyltransferase, [alpha]2->3sialyltransferase, [beta]1->4Gal-transferase, and elongation [beta]1->3GlcNAc-transferase, did not correlate with sLex expression levels. (2) The transcripts of Fuc-TVII were not parallel with sLex expression, and those of ST3Gal IV and [beta]1->4Gal-transferase were constitutively detected in all cell lines tested. (3) There was no detectable enzyme activity for core 3 and 4 backbone structure synthesis in human B cell lines. (4) By contrast, the enzyme activities and transcripts of UDP-GlcNAc:Gal[beta]1->3GalNAc (GlcNAc to GalNAc) [beta]1->6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core2GnT) had significant correlation with the cell surface expression of sLex antigen. (5) Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a major ~150 kDa glycoprotein that carries O-linked oligosaccharides recognized by anti-sLex monoclonal antibody in sLex-positive pre-B leukemia cell lines. This correlation of Core2GnT with CD15s expression suggests that Core2GnT is a regulator of the cell surface expression of sLex in human pre-B lymphoid cells.\r\nMajority of the leukocyte differentiation markers are glycoproteins and each protein has a unique primary sequence that may direct the function of the molecule. In a proportion of the antigens, however, the protein portion may serve as a carrier that presents cell surface carbohydrate antigens. In addition, some established differentiation antigens are expressed on the carbohydrate chains of glycosphingolipids. A recent account of such carbohydrate antigens includes CD15, CD15s, CDw17, CD57, CDw60, CDw65, CDw75, and CD76 (Schlossman et al., 1995). The carbohydrate antigens, like the protein antigens, may be expressed in a lineage specific manner or a differentiation stage specific manner.\r\n\r\nCD15s antigen (sialyl-Lex; sLex)3 is a well-established ligand of cell adhesion molecules, CD62E, CD62P, and CD62L also known as E-, P-, and L-selectins, respectively (Lowe et al., 1990; Phillips et al., 1990; Walz et al., 1990). The antigen mediates the cell adhesion with E-selectin on the endothelial cells, and this adhesion is considered as the initial and essential step of cancer cell metastasis and leukemia cell infiltration (Takada et al., 1993). In human leukocytes, sLex is expressed on myeloids, lymphoids, and monocytes (Schlossman et al., 1995). The formation of sLex structures as well as the other terminal carbohydrate structures has been demonstrated to be accomplished by sequential actions of glycosyltransferases. Expression of sLex structures was proved to be through the action of [alpha]1->3fucosyltransferase VII (Fuc-TVII) (Knibbs et al., 1996). On the other hand, regulation mechanism of sLex expression during differentiation and transformation has not been fully elucidated. It is true that most of the previous studies have been concentrated on the terminal fucosylation or sialylation in their investigations. However, during differentiation and transformation of human and murine myelogenous leukemia cells, we have demonstrated that the most up-stream glycosyltransferases markedly influenced the expression levels of the terminal carbohydrate structures by modulating the total metabolic flow of the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis at the upstream branching step (Nojiri et al., 1988; Kitagawa et al., 1989; Nakamura et al., 1991, 1992, 1996; Tsunoda et al., 1995).\r\n\r\nIn the present study, we have tried to investigate the biosynthetic mechanism of CD15s antigen recognized by KM93 monoclonal antibody (mAb) using human B lymphoid cell lines. We present here our results that KM93-reactive sLex structures of B lymphoids are mainly expressed on O-linked oligosaccharide chains and the O-glycans are located on a ~150 kDa glycoprotein. In addition, it is suggested that the up-stream branching UDP-GlcNAc:Gal[beta]1->3GalNAc (GlcNAc to GalNAc) [beta]1->6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core2GnT or C2GnT) critically regulates the expression levels of antigenic determinant CD15s produced by FucT-VII and ST3GalIV.'",2
"b'Anti-single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) B cells are regulated in non-autoimmune mice. In this report we show that while both anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA B cells are blocked in their ability to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells, other phenotypic and functional characteristics distinguish them from one another. Splenic anti-ssDNA B cells are found distributed throughout the B cell follicle, and are phenotypically mature and long-lived. On the other hand, splenic anti-dsDNA B cells are short-lived, exhibit an immature and antigen-experienced phenotype, and localize to the T\x96B interface of the splenic follicle. Functionally, anti-ssDNA B cells proliferate, albeit suboptimally, in response to anti-IgM, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD40L/IL-4 + anti-IgM stimulation, and tyrosine phosphorylate intracellular proteins upon mIgM cross-linking. Anti-dsDNA B cells, on the other hand, are functionally unresponsive to anti-IgM and LPS stimulation, and do not phosphorylate intracellular proteins, including Syk, upon mIg stimulation. Importantly, anti-DNA B cell anergy is maintained in the absence of T cells since both anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA B cells are as efficiently regulated in RAG2\x96/\x96 mice as in their RAG2+/+ counterparts. Interestingly, the severely anergic state of anti-dsDNA B cells is partially reversible upon stimulation with CD40 ligand and IL-4. In response to these signals, anti-dsDNA B cells remain viable, up-regulate cell surface expression of B7-2 and IgM, and restore their ability to proliferate and phosphorylate Syk upon mIg cross-linking. Collectively, these data suggest that anti-DNA B cell anergy encompasses distinct phenotypes which, even in its most severe form, may be reversible upon stimulation with T cell-derived factors.'",4
"b'trans-sialidase is a unique sialidase in that, instead of hydrolizing sialic acid, it preferentially transfers the monosaccharide to a terminal [beta]-galactose in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme, originally identified in Trypanosoma cruzi, belongs to a large family of proteins. Some members of the family lack the enzymatic activity. No function has been yet assigned to them. In this work, the gene copy number and the possible function of inactive members of the trans-sialidase family was studied. It is shown that genes encoding inactive members are not a few, but rather, are present in the same copy number (60-80 per haploid genome) as those encoding active trans-sialidases. Recombinant inactive proteins were purified and assayed for sialic acid and galactose binding activity in agglutination tests. The enzymatically inactive trans-sialidases were found to agglutinate de-sialylated erythrocytes but not untreated red blood cells. Assays made with mouse and rabbit red blood cells suggest that inactive trans-sialidases bind to [beta], rather than [alpha], terminal galactoses, the same specificity required by active trans-sialidases. A recombinant molecule that was made enzymatically inactive through a mutation in a single amino acid also retained the galactose binding activity. The binding was competed by lactose and was dependent on conservation of the protein native conformation. Therefore, at least some molecules in the trans-sialidase family that have lost their enzymatic function still retain their Gal-binding properties and might have a function as lectins in the parasite-host interaction.'",2
"b'Alcoholics, heroin addicts and normal controls were asked for their degree of preference for the two lateral (left, right) sides during their performance of unilateral activities involving one of the four paired organs, hand, foot, eye and ear. Side-bias was assessed by a questionnaire, with 22 items for hand preference, and five items each for foot, eye and ear preference. Group difference was assessed with a mixed-factorial design (Group x Side) for each form of side-bias. Unlike heroin addicts and normal controls, alcoholics exhibited a significant reduction in right side-bias for all four measures, which suggests an anomalous pattern of lateralization.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'To examine methods for combining quantitative results for serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and refining these by inclusion of patient characteristics. Methods: Data from 1684 subjects, recruited from the general population, abstainer groups and alcohol treatment centres (participants in the five nations WHO/ISBRA study of biological markers of alcohol use), were used to develop clinical rules for combining results of GGT, AST and CDT. The algorithm derived by Sillanaukee and Olsson was tested, and compared with new algorithms derived by logistic regression and discriminant analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by area underneath the receiver operator characteristic curve. Effects of adding gender and clinical information to the algorithm were estimated. Results: The predictive ability of combination rules derived from the two studies and by two different statistical techniques was remarkably consistent. For men, combining lnCDT and lnGGT provided the best accuracy for detecting daily consumption of 60 g ethanol or more in the past 30 days. For women, GGT alone provided the best accuracy for that consumption level. Clinical variables added significantly to the diagnostic accuracy of the models for both men and women, and conversely the test results modified the probability of problem drinking as assessed from clinical data alone. A graphic method was produced to help clinicians estimate probabilities for consumption of 60 g or more per day. Conclusions: Combining biochemical markers enhances detection of problem drinking in men but not in women. Information on clinical variables increases the ability to correctly detect problem drinking.'",0
"b'To investigate in detail the expression of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) on endothelial cells, 4.85 \xd7 109 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultivated in a 2 l bioreactor using microcarriers as a support for anchorage dependent growing cells. Neutral GSLs and gangliosides were isolated and their structures were determined by TLC immunostaining, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) of the native GSLs, and gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) of partially methylated alditol acetates. GbOse4Cer, GbOse3Cer, and LacCer, all carrying mainly C24- and C16-fatty acid beside C18-sphingosine, were detected as the major neutral GSLs (36%, 23%, and 15% of the total orcinol stain, respectively); GlcCer, nLcOse4Cer, and nLcOse6Cer were expressed to substantial minor amounts (9%, 12%, and 5% of the total orcinol stain, respectively). TLC immunostaining revealed the presence of lipid bound Lewisx antigen, whereas the isomeric Lewisa structure was detectable only in very low quantities. GM3(Neu5Ac) with C18-sphingosine was the major ganglioside constituting about 90% of the whole ganglioside fraction. The fatty acid composition was determined by GC-MS of fatty acid methyl esters, indicating the predominance of C24- and C16-substituted GM3(Neu5Ac), followed by C18- and C22-substituted species. Terminally [alpha]2-3 sialylated neolacto-series ganglioside IV3Neu5Ac-nLcOse4Cer was the second most abundant ganglioside in HUVECs (8% of the total resorcinol stain), and IV6Neu5Ac-nLcOse4Cer and VI3Neu5Ac-nLcOse6Cer (together less than 2% of total resorcinol stain) were found in minor quantities. Lipid bound sialyl Lewisx antigen with poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl chains, and traces of gangliotetraose-type gangliosides GM1 and GD1a were identified by TLC immunostaining. The expression of dominant neutral GSLs LacCer, GbOse3Cer, and GbOse4Cer, and of ganglioside GM3(Neu5Ac) was assayed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of cell layers grown in chamber slides, each showing different plasma membrane and subcellular distribution patterns. The complete structural characterization of GSLs from HUVECs contributes to our understanding about their functional role, not only of the carbohydrate but also of the lipid moiety, as receptors for bacterial toxins, as cell surface antigens of cellular interaction and as receptors for blood components and macromolecules of the extracellular matrix.'",2
"b'Background Multilevel modelling, also known as hierarchical regression, generalizes ordinary regression modelling to distinguish multiple levels of information in a model. Use of multiple levels gives rise to an enormous range of statistical benefits. To aid in understanding these benefits, this article provides an elementary introduction to the conceptual basis for multilevel modelling, beginning with classical frequentist, Bayes, and empirical-Bayes techniques as special cases. The article focuses on the role of multilevel averaging (\x91shrinkage\x92) in the reduction of estimation error, and the role of prior information in finding good averages.\r\n\r\nKeywords Bayesian statistics, empirical-Bayes estimation, hierarchical regression, mixed models, multilevel modelling, random-coefficient regression, ridge regression, risk assessment, Stein estimation'",3
"b'The function of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) during B cell differentiation is not precisely defined. To investigate the pre-BCR receptor activity, we have established pre-BCR-positive pre-B cell lines that are able to differentiate into immature B cells in vitro. Antibody cross-linking of the pre-BCR induced apoptosis and differentiation accompanied with tyrosine phosphorylation. A specific tyrosine-phosphorylated 43 kDa protein (p43) was found down-stream of the pre-BCR. The results demonstrated the receptor function of pre-BCR, which indicates that a ligand-like molecule or a cross-linking structure on the cell surface is possibly present.'",4

"b'IL-4 is a cytokine which can be expressed by a number of cell types including Th2 cells, mast cells and a population of CD4+ NK1.1+ NK T cells. Although phenotypic markers exist for identifying each of these cell types, there is at present no known cell surface marker common to all IL-4-producing cells. Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we have modified the IL-4 locus by knock-in of a transmembrane domain to generate mice that express a membrane-bound form of IL-4 (mIL-4). Flow cytometry using an IL-4-specific mAb allowed the detection of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells, mast cells and NK T cells from mIL-4 mice. Furthermore, the analysis of immune responses in mIL-4 mice following immunization with anti-CD3 and anti-IgD has allowed us to identify distinct subpopulations of IL-4-producing NK T cells. Thus, the expression of IL-4 in a membrane-bound form provides a novel method for the identification and characterization of IL-4-producing cells.'",4
"b'This paper examines the clinical characteristics associated with tobacco use and nicotine dependence in a large sample of alcohol-dependent subjects. The goal was to determine if the characteristics of the alcohol use history were associated with the smoking status, even after controlling for additional characteristics, such as the antisocial personality disorder, other drug dependence and gender. As part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, a semi-structured interview, including a detailed history of alcohol and tobacco use, was administered to 1005 alcohol-dependent men and women, made up of 658 (65.5%) current smokers, 167 (16.6%) former smokers, and 180 (17.9%) non-smokers. Among former smokers, 50.3%, and among current smokers, 72.8% had ever been nicotine-dependent (DSM-III-R). Current smokers and nicotine-dependent subjects had a greater severity of alcohol dependence, even as evaluated through logistic regression analyses in which gender and associated diagnoses were considered. The data also enabled us to study the relationships among depression, nicotine dependence, and alcohol dependence, with most of the correlation occurring for substance-induced, not independent, mood disorders.'",0
"b'Background The spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Cambodia is mainly caused by sexual transmission and the high-risk group in this country are female commercial sex workers (CSW). There are two types of CSW, direct CSW (DCSW) and indirect CSW (IDCSW), who are different from each other in sexual activities. This study was conducted in order to describe the risk factors on HIV for each type of CSW, and to establish effective preventive strategies against the HIV epidemic among CSW.\r\n\r\nMethods The participants, 143 DCSW and 94 IDCSW, were interviewed using a questionnaire to determine their demographic characteristics and behaviour. Blood samples were taken for serological tests on HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilis. The association between their behavioural pattern and their serological results was analysed.\r\n\r\nResults The questionnaire study showed that IDCSW had a riskier behavioural pattern than DCSW. The HIV seroprevalence rates of the DCSW and the IDCSW were 52.4% and 22.3%, respectively. Univariate logistic analyses showed a significant association between HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) and current age, age at commencement of commercial sex work, duration of commercial sex work, and the seropositivity of Chlamydia trachomatis\x97IgG antibody (CT-IgG-Ab) among the DCSW. The analyses also showed a significant relationship between HIV-Ab and CT-IgG-Ab among the IDCSW.\r\n\r\nConclusions Improving condom use rate is very important in order to prevent an HIV epidemic among the two types of CSW. This study also suggests it is important to prevent sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The STD control programme could be efficient for HIV prevention, especially among DCSW.'",3
"b'Dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P) is a polyisoprenoid glycosyl carrier lipid essential for the assembly of a variety of glycoconjugates in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. In yeast, dolichols with chain lengths of 14\x9617 isoprene units are predominant, whereas in mammalian cells they contain 19\x9622 isoprene units. In this biosynthetic pathway, t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate is elongated to the appropriate long chain polyprenyl pyrophosphate by the sequential addition of cis-isoprene units donated by isopentenyl pyrophosphate with t,t,c-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate being the initial intermediate formed. The condensation steps are catalyzed by cis-isoprenyltransferase (cis-IPTase). Genes encoding cis-IPTase activity have been identified in Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RER2). Yeast cells deleted for the RER2 locus display a severe growth defect, but are still viable, possibly due to the activity of an homologous locus, SRT1. The dolichol and Dol-P content of exponentially growing revertants of RER2 deleted cells ({Delta}rer2) and of cells overexpressing SRT1 have been determined by HPLC analysis. Dolichols and Dol-Ps with 19\x9622 isoprene units, unusually long for yeast, were found, and shown to be utilized for the biosynthesis of lipid intermediates involved in protein N-glycosylation. In addition, cis-IPTase activity in microsomes from {Delta}rer2 cells overexpressing SRT1 was 7- to 17-fold higher than in microsomes from {Delta}rer2 cells. These results establish that yeast contains at least two cis-IPTases, and indicate that the chain length of dolichols is determined primarily by the enzyme catalyzing the chain elongation stage of the biosynthetic process.'",2
"b'The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of Kupffer cells during the increase of portal vein pressure caused by ethanol. We measured nitric oxide (NO) in the perfused rat liver using a commercial NO meter. Ethanol perfusion increased NO release and portal vein pressure. Gadolinium chloride pretreatment reduced the increase in portal vein pressure during the early phase of ethanol perfusion, but did not affect the release of NO after ethanol infusion. These findings suggest that Kupffer cells play an important role in liver microcirculation during the early stage of ethanol intake, but that the mechanism may not be regulated by NO.'",0
"b'There have been significant developments towards the elucidation of molecular and cellular changes in neuronal second messenger pathways involved in the development of tolerance to and dependence on ethanol (EtOH). The long-term exposure to EtOH has been shown to affect several aspects of neuronal signal transduction as well as ligand-gated ion channels and receptor systems, including the receptors that are coupled to the superfamily of GTP binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). The recent identification of a G-protein coupled receptor that was activated by {delta}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of marijuana, led to the discovery of endogenous agonists. One such agonist found to exist in mammalian brain was characterized to be an arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite and was named anandamide (AnNH). AnNH has been shown to bind specifically to the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and mimic many of the pharmacological and behavioural effects of THC including tolerance development. The role of endocannabinoids and the CB1 receptor signal transduction system in tolerance development to drugs of abuse has not been explored until recently. The findings presented in this review provide evidence for the first time that some of the pharmacological actions of EtOH including tolerance development may be mediated through participation of the endocannabinoid\x96CB1 receptor signal transduction system. Recent studies have shown that chronic EtOH exposure produces downregulation of CB1 receptors and an inhibition of CB1 receptor agonist-stimulated GTP{gamma}S binding in mouse brain synaptic plasma membranes (SPM). The observed receptor downregulation results from the persistent stimulation of the receptors by the endogenous CB1 receptor agonist AnNH, the synthesis of which is increased by chronic EtOH exposure. Further, the CB1 receptor antagonist SR-141716A has been shown to block voluntary EtOH intake in rats and mice. Based on these studies, a hypothesis is presented to explain the possible involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pharmacological and behavioural effects of EtOH.'",0
"b'Background A potential problem for malaria vaccine development and testing is between-host variation in antibody responses to specific malaria antigens. Previous work in adults in an area highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum in Papua New Guinea found that genetic regulation partly explained heterogeneity in responsiveness. We have now assessed the relative contributions of environmental and genetic factors in total IgG responses to specific malaria antigens in children, and quantified temporal variation within individuals of total IgG responses.\r\n\r\nMethods Total IgG responses against schizont extract, merozoite surface protein-1, merozoite surface protein-2, ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, and SPf66 were measured by ELISA. Variance component analysis was used to estimate the variation explained by genetic and environmental factors in these antibody responses. Intra- and inter-class correlations of antibody responses within relative pairs were estimated. We adjusted for age, P. falciparum density, sex and village differences either within or prior to the analysis.\r\n\r\nResults For all malaria antigens, temporal variation in the total IgG response was the predominant source of variation. There was substantial familial aggregation of all IgG responses, but it remained unclear how much this clustering was attributable to genetic factors and how much to a common environment in the household. The remaining variance, which could not be explained by either of the above, was very small for most of the antigens.\r\n\r\nConclusions Temporal variation and clustering of immune responses to specific malaria antigens need to be taken into account when planning, conducting and interpreting immuno-epidemiological and vaccine studies.'",3
"b'Background Invasive meningococcal disease, due to Neisseria meningitidis, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in young children and adolescents. Nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci (MC), is most prevalent in young adults whereas carriage of Neisseria lactamica (LC), a related non-pathogenic organism, is most prevalent in young children. The objective of this study was to use modelling techniques to test hypotheses on the processes that govern the incidence of meningococcal disease (MD).\r\n\r\nMethods Deterministic compartmental models were fitted to age structured data sets of MC, LC and MD.\r\n\r\nResults The model most consistent with the available data sets is one where LC inhibits MC, an inhibition that lasts for a mean of 4.7 years. The hypothesis that LC also acts as a natural immunogen against MD was consistent with this model. The second peak of MD observed among adolescents could be due to the peak in the acquisition of MC in this age group.\r\n\r\nConclusions The role of LC as a natural immunogen against asymptomatic and symptomatic meningococcal infection was consistent with available field data. If the introduction of novel meningococcal vaccines into a population changes the prevalence of MC or LC, this could have a substantial impact on the effectiveness of immunization programmes. This paper demonstrates the potential utility of modelling to estimate these effects.'",3
"b'ESBRA\x96NORDMANN 1998 AWARD LECTURE: VISUAL P3 AS A POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY MARKER OF ALCOHOLISM: EVIDENCE FROM THE AMSTERDAM STUDY OF CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS \r\nRecent data from the Amsterdam Study of Children of Alcoholics add to the evidence for considering the P300 or P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) as a potential vulnerability marker of alcoholism. In this study, multi-channel ERPs were recorded from 7- to 18-year-old children of alcoholics (COAs) and age- and sex-matched low-risk controls using several experimental paradigms, including a visual novelty oddball task and a visual selective attention task. The results indicated that differences between COAs and controls in the visual P3 amplitude: (1) can be elicited both actively by task-relevant target stimuli and passively by irrelevant novel stimuli; (2) are a function of both the attentional relevance and the target properties of the eliciting stimulus; (3) are mediated by multiple brain generators, rather than by a single generator; (4) originate from a difference in the strength, rather than in the spatial configuration, of the underlying brain generators; (5) cannot be accounted for by differences in visual attention-related earlier occurring ERP components; and (6) can be moderated by current behavioural and emotional problems, general intellectual ability, and socio-economic background. These findings support the notion that a relatively small visual P3 amplitude in COAs reflects heritable biases in attention and information processing that are related to their increased vulnerability to alcoholism. \r\n'",0
"b'This study describes the processing of human tumor cells or cell membranes to express {alpha}-gal epitopes (Gal{alpha}1-3Gal-\xdf1-4GlcNAc-R) by the use of New World monkey (marmoset) recombinant {alpha}1,3galactosyltransferase (r{alpha}1,3GT), produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Such tumor cells and membranes may serve, in cancer patients, as autologous tumor vaccines that are targeted in vivo to antigen-presenting cells by the anti-Gal antibody. This r{alpha}1,3GT lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, ensuring its solubility without detergent. It is effectively produced in P. pastoris under constitutive expression of the PGAP promoter and is secreted into the culture medium in a soluble, truncated form fused to a (His)6 tag. This tag enables the simple affinity purification of r{alpha}1,3GT on a nickel-Sepharose column and elution with imidazole. The purified enzyme appears in SDS\x96PAGE as two bands with the size of 40 and 41 kDa and displays the same acceptor specificity as the mammalian native enzyme. r{alpha}1,3GT is very effective in synthesizing {alpha}-gal epitopes on membrane-bound carbohydrate chains and displays a specific activity of 1.2 nM membrane bound {alpha}-gal epitopes/min/mg. Incubation of very large amounts of human acute myeloid leukemia cells (1 x 109 cells) with neuraminidase, r{alpha}1,3GT, and UDP-Gal resulted in the synthesis of approximately 6 x 106 {alpha}-gal epitopes per cell. Effective synthesis of {alpha}-gal epitopes could be achieved also with as much as 2 g cell membranes prepared from the tumor of a patient with ovarian carcinoma. These data imply that r{alpha}1,3GT produced in P. pastoris is suitable for the synthesis of {alpha}-gal epitopes on bulk amounts of tumor cells or cell membranes required for the preparation of autologous tumor vaccines.'",2
"b'Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that activation in left inferior prefrontal cortices (LIPC) is reduced during repeated (primed) relative to initial (unprimed) stimulus processing. These reductions in anterior (~BA 45/47) and posterior (~BA 44/6) LIPC activation have been interpreted as reflecting implicit memory for initial semantic or phonological processing. However, prior studies do not unambiguously indicate that LIPC priming effects are specific to the recapitulation of higher-level (semantic and/or phonological), rather than lower-level (perceptual), processes. Moreover, no prior study has shown that the patterns of priming in anterior and posterior LIPC regions are dissociable. To address these issues, the present fMRI study examined the nature of priming in LIPC by examining the task-specificity of these effects. Participants initially processed words in either a semantic or a nonsemantic manner. Subsequently, participants were scanned while they made semantic decisions about words that had been previously processed in a semantic manner (within-task repetition), words that had been previously processed in a nonsemantic manner (across-task repetition), and words that had not been previously processed (novel words). Behaviorally, task-specific priming was observed: reaction times to make the semantic decision declined following prior semantic processing but not following prior nonsemantic processing of a word. Priming in anterior LIPC paralleled these results with signal reductions being observed following within-task, but not following across-task, repetition. Importantly, neural priming in posterior LIPC demonstrated a different pattern: priming was observed following both within-task and across-task repetition, with the magnitude of priming tending to be greater in the within-task condition. Direct comparison between anterior and posterior LIPC regions revealed a significant interaction. These findings indicate that anterior and posterior LIPC demonstrate distinct patterns of priming, with priming in the anterior region being task-specific, suggesting that this facilitation derives from repeated semantic processing of a stimulus.'",1
"b'GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase is involved in formation of 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine-containing structures such as 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x. We investigated the mode of expression of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase during postimplantation embryogenesis in the mouse by in situ hybridization. Sulfotransferase mRNA was not detected on embryonic day (E) 6.5, while on E7.5 it was detected in the mesoderm, ectoderm, and ectoplacental cone. On E10.5, the sulfotransferase signals were mainly observed in the nervous tissue. On E12.5 and 13.5, various tissues in the process of differentiation expressed this mRNA. Several epithelial and mesenchymal tissues undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal interactions strongly expressed the mRNA. For example, in the developing tooth strong sulfotransferase mRNA expression was found only in the condensing mesenchyme on E13.5. On E13.5 and 15.5, the sites showing intense expression of the sulfotransferase again became restricted. In the brain, sulfotransferase mRNA was frequently found as discrete signals in narrow regions. These results suggest that 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine structures have important roles in development. On E13.5 and 15.5, G152 (6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x antigen) was expressed in the neocortex, and AG223 (6-sulfo Lewis x antigen) in the thalamus and neocortex where the sulfotransferase signal was detected. However, in other organs, expression of these antigens did not correlate with the sulfotransferase mRNA, implicating complex nature of regulation of expression of the fucosyl 6-sulfo antigens.'",2
"b""We have used mRNA differential display PCR to search for genes induced in activated T cells and we identified a gene encoding an {alpha}2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc IV) that is rapidly induced in lymphocytes after antigen or mitogen stimulation. The 3.6 kb full-length cDNA clone (MK45) obtained contained a single open reading frame encoding a 302 amino acid protein and a 2.5 kb 3' untranslated region. MK45 expression in in vivo-activated CD8 T cells reached the highest level 4 h after antigen triggering and then declined rapidly to nearly base levels within 45 h. Northern blot analysis further revealed that MK45 expression was also induced in LPS-activated B cells and antigen-triggered CD4 T cells in vitro. MK45 expression was low or undetectable in most other mouse tissues examined, when compared to activated lymphocytes. Importantly, the mRNA expression level of other sialyltransferases remained largely unchanged during the early stage of lymphocyte activation. Finally, increased ecto-sialyltransferase activity and an altered sialylation pattern were demonstrated on the cell surface of early activated CD8 T cells. Our report identifies a candidate sialyltransferase gene that is involved in the early alteration of the sialylation pattern of cell surface molecules in activated lymphocytes.""",4
"b'Glycoconjugate-bound fucose, abundant in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, has been found in the form of Fuc{alpha}1,3GlcNAc, Fuc{alpha}1,2Fuc, Fuc{alpha}1,6GlcNAc, and perhaps Fuc{alpha}1,4GlcNAc linkages. Here we quantify fucosyltransferase activities in three developmental stages of S. mansoni. Assays were performed using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis with detection of radioactive fucose incorporation from GDP-[14C]-fucose into structurally defined acceptors. The total fucosyltransferase-specific activity in egg extracts was 50-fold higher than that in the other life stages tested (cercaria and adult worms). A fucosyltransferase was detected that transferred fucose to type-2 oligosaccharides (Gal\xdf1,4GlcNAc-R), both sialylated (with the sialic acid attached to the terminal Gal by {alpha}2,3 or 2,6 linkage) and nonsialylated. Another fucosyltransferase was identified that transferred fucose to lactose-based and type-2 fucosylated oligosaccharides, such as LNFIII (Gal\xdf1,4(Fuc{alpha}1,3)GlcNAc\xdf1,3Gal\xdf1,4Glc). A low level of fucosyltransferase that transfers fucose to no-sialylated type-1 oligosaccharides (Gal\xdf1,3GlcNAc-R) was also detected. These studies revealed multifucosylated products of the reactions. In addition, the effects of fucose-type iminosugars inhibitors were tested on schistosome fucosyltransferases. A new fucose-type 1-N-iminosugar was four- to sixfold more potent as an inhibitor of schistosome fucosyltransferases in vitro than was deoxyfuconojirimycin. In vivo, this novel 1-iminosugar blocked the expression of a fucosylated epitope (mAb 128C3/3 antigen) that is associated with the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis.'",2
"b'Chronic ingestion of ethanol (EtOH) produces physiological and morphological alterations in skeletal muscle. The effects of EtOH on skeletal muscle have been studied in experimental animals or on biopsies from alcoholic patients. However, alterations in skeletal muscle from alcoholic patients could be secondary to the effects of EtOH on the nervous system. In this study, by assaying the action of EtOH on primary skeletal muscle cell cultures, we provide evidence of its direct effect on skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation. The results indicate that EtOH: (1) significantly inhibits skeletal muscle cell proliferation at the beginning of the proliferation phase; (2) delays skeletal muscle differentiation, shown by the significant changes in the evolution of the percentage of the creatine kinase isozymes; (3) has no significant effect on skeletal muscle DNA or protein content during the proliferation phase.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""Background Studies have often compared the postnatal motor development of \x91small\x92 versus \x91normal\x92 newborns. Not much is known about the associations between a broad spectrum of size at birth and motor development. The effect of early postnatal growth on motor development is little researched. Growth failure in terms of shortness and thinness should be differentiated, but not many studies have the data for this analysis.\r\n\r\nMethods This is a longitudinal study of infants born in Lahore, Pakistan, between 1984 and 1987. Age at commencement of independent walking and age at \x91building a 3-cube tower\x92 were taken as indicators of gross and fine motor development, respectively. Size at birth was captured by length and thinness as continuous variables; postnatal growth from birth to 6 months of age was measured by changes in length and thinness. Adjustment for covariates and handling of censored cases were performed by generalized log gamma regression.\r\n\r\nResults Thinness at birth and postnatal stunting and wasting had a linear, inverse association with gross motor development (each P < 0.05). Birth length had a non-linear, inverse association with this outcome (P < 0.05). Birth length, thinness at birth and postnatal wasting had a linear, inverse association with fine motor development (each P < 0.05).\r\n\r\nConclusion Both fetal and early postnatal growth over a broad spectrum may affect infants' motor development. It is not just the babies who were very small at birth that suffered. Birth length appeared to be more influential than other anthropometric indicators.\r\n\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\r\nshortness at birth, thinness at birth and postnatal wasting were inversely related messages to the age at commencement of milestones of gross and fine motor development. \r\npostnatal stunting was inversely related to the age at commencement of a gross motor milestone. \r\nvariation of growth over a broad spectrum was related to the outcome measures; it was not just the babies who were very small that suffered. \r\nshortness at birth appeared to be more important than other aspects of fetal and early postnatal growth in determining motor development.

"b'Background Few studies have evaluated the difference in mortality between twins and singleton children during the postneonatal and childhood period in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to quantify the excess mortality of twins during the postneonatal and childhood period and to identify factors that contribute to the excess mortality among twins. The different use made of health care services was hypothesized to contribute to the increased mortality.\r\n\r\nMethods The Demographic and Health Survey data on Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia were pooled. Logistic regression was used to estimate twin/singleton differences for the combined postneonatal and child mortality and to study the role of intermediate factors and effect modifiers.\r\n\r\nResults The study was based on 18 214 singleton children and 706 twins. The twin/ singleton odds ratio (OR) of the combined postneonatal and child mortality was 2.33 (95% CI : 1.85\x962.93). This excess mortality was largest during the first year of life. Control for intermediate factors (preventive health care and breastfeeding) did not sizeably diminish the mortality difference. Effect modifiers that were associated with increased twin/singleton OR were male sex, unwanted child, short birth interval and low socioeconomic status.\r\n\r\nConclusions The excess mortality of twins compared to singletons is considerable. A difference in use of preventive health care or in breastfeeding cannot explain the increased mortality. Males, unwanted children, those born after a short birth interval and the socioeconomically disadvantaged are at special risk. The generally good attendance at under-5 clinics gives health care providers the opportunity for increased surveillance of these high-risk groups.'",3
"b""Large sectors of polymodal cortex project to the hippocampal formation via convergent input to the entorhinal cortex. The present study reports an additional access route, whereby several cortical areas project directly to CA1. These are parietal areas 7a and 7b, area TF medial to the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), and a restricted area in the lateral bank of the OTS that may be part of ventromedial area TE. These particular cortical areas are implicated in visuospatial processes; and their projection to and convergence within CA1 may be significant for the elaboration of `view fields', for the postulated role of the hippocampal formation in topographic learning and memory, or for the snapshot identification of objects in the setting of complex visuospatial relationships. Convergence of vestibular and visual inputs (from areas 7b and 7a respectively) would support previous physiological findings that hippocampal neurons respond to combinations of whole-body motion and a view of the environment. The direct corticohippocampal connections are widely divergent, especially those from the temporal areas, which extend over much of the anteroposterior axis of the hippocampal main body. Divergent connections potentially influence large populations of CA1 pyramidal neurons, consistent with the suggestion that these neurons are involved in conjunctive coding. The same region of ventromedial TE, besides the direct connections to CA1, also gives rise to direct projections to area V1, and may correspond to a functionally specialized subdivision, perhaps part of VTF.""",1
"b'Longitudinal studies indicate that declines in cognition and memory accelerate after age 70 years. The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive change are unclear, as there is little information on longitudinal brain changes. We are conducting a longitudinal neuroimaging study of nondemented older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. This report focuses on age and sex differences in brain structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging during the first two annual evaluations. Cross- sectional results from 116 participants aged 59\x9685 years reveal significantly larger ventricular volumes and smaller gray and white matter volumes in older compared with younger participants and in men compared with women. Regional brain volumes show that the effects of age and sex are not uniform across brain regions. Age differences are greatest for the parietal region. Sex differences tend to be larger for frontal and temporal than parietal and occipital regions. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates an increase of 1526 mm3 in ventricular volume over 1 year, but no detectable change in total or regional brain volumes. Definition of the pattern and rate of longitudinal brain changes will facilitate the detection of pathological brain changes, which may be predictors of dementia.'",1
"b""This letter is a report of a re-evaluation of the results obtained in an earlier study of ours (Balldin et al., 1994Go) of platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B activity in alcoholics with reduced dopamine (DA) D2 receptor function, as assessed by the growth hormone (GH) response to the D1/D2 agonist apomorphine (APO), which was published in this journal. The reason for the re-evaluation of the results in our study is a Letter to the Editors of this journal by Farren and Dinan (1996) reporting on platelet MAO-B activity in alcoholics with reduced DA D2 receptor function, as assessed by the GH response to the DA D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine. In the report by Farren and Dinan (1996), four of eight alcoholics had no increase in GH above baseline, whereas all eight subjects in the control group had the expected GH response to bromocriptine. The authors compared platelet MAO-B activity in the four alcoholic subjects who had no increase in GH above baseline to that in the four alcoholics who had a significant increase in GH after bromocriptine. They found no significant difference in platelet MAO-B activity between these two groups and thus no evidence for altered platelet MAO-B activity in alcoholics with reduced DA D2 receptor function.\r\n\r\nIn their Letter to the Editors, Farren and Dinan (1996) made a very valuable comment with regard to our earlier study (Balldin et al., 1994Go). We then reported that platelet MAO-B activity in alcoholics with reduced DA D2 receptor function, as assessed by the GH response to the DA D1/D2 receptor agonist APO, was not different from that in controls. Eleven out of 14 alcoholics had blunted GH response to APO (an increase in GH above baseline of less than 8 mU/l), in comparison to three out of 12 in the control group. Farren and Dinan (1996) correctly pointed out that we did not compare platelet MAO-B activity in the alcoholics with blunted GH response (n = 11) to those with non-blunted GH response (n = 3). This comment by Farren and Dinan (1996) thus prompted us to re-evaluate the results in our earlier study.\r\n\r\nWhen defining blunted GH response in a neuroendocrine challenge test, two criteria for bluntness have been proposed: (1) an increase in GH less than 8 mU/l (Hunt et al., 1986Go) or (2) less than 2 mU/l (Nutt, 1989Go). Taking into account that, in the report by Farren and Dinan (1996), comparison of platelet MAO-B activity was made between alcoholics who had no increase in GH above baseline to those who had, we also used the lower criteria for bluntness of 2 mU/l in our re-evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe subjects were 14 male patients with a mean \xb1 SD age of 45 \xb1 9 years. They all fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence according to DSM III-R (American Psychiatric Association, 1987Go). The total reported length of their alcoholism was 20 \xb1 8 years. The length of the last period of continuous alcohol intake prior to investigation was 157 \xb1 222 days with an estimated daily alcohol consumption of 377 \xb1 163 g of pure ethanol. All patients had earlier been admitted to psychiatric hospitals (16 \xb1 23 times) and 10 had also been treated in hospitals for alcohol-related medical disorders. Eleven patients had experienced hallucinosis and six of those had also had delirium tremens during earlier withdrawal episodes. During a 2-month period prior to the investigation, all patients were carefully controlled for sobriety by staff members at a treatment unit and also with the aid of repeated tests for liver function. Twelve male subjects (age 46 \xb1 10 years) were recruited as controls. Based on an interview, they were all considered physically and psychiatrically healthy. Results of routine laboratory analyses were all within the laboratory reference ranges. All of them were light social drinkers with a reported alcohol consumption of less than 100 g of pure ethanol weekly. In the statistics, an unpaired t-test was used for comparisons between groups, since the data on MAO-B activity appeared to have normal distributions.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Fig. 1, when the criterion for bluntness of a GH response to APO of less than 8 mU/l was used, the platelet MAO-B activity was 3.8 \xb1 1.2 (mean \xb1 SD) \xb5kat/kg protein in the patients with blunted GH responses (n = 11), 5.7 \xb1 0.6 \xb5kat/kg protein in the patients with non-blunted GH responses (n = 3), and 5.2 \xb1 1.6 \xb5kat/kg protein in the controls (n = 12). The platelet MAO-B activity was therefore significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the patients with blunted GH responses in comparison both to patients with non-blunted GH responses and to controls. When the lower criterion for bluntness of 2 mU/l was used the platelet MAO-B activity was 3.6 \xb1 1.2 \xb5kat/kg protein in the patients with blunted GH responses (n = 9) and 5.3 \xb1 0.7 \xb5kat/kg protein with non-blunted GH responses (n = 5). Platelet MAO-B activity was thus significantly lower in the patients with blunted GH responses in comparison to patients with non-blunted GH responses and to controls (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when platelet MAO-B activity was correlated with the GH response to APO, a significant correlation was obtained in the patients when using either Pearson's product moment correlation (r = 0.58, P < 0.05) or Spearman's rank-correlation (r = 0.72, P < 0.01); the latter probably being more appropriate, since the GH data appeared to have an abnormal distribution. That is, low platelet MAO-B activity was found in patients with low GH response to APO. There was no correlation between platelet MAO-B activity and GH response to APO in the controls.\r\n\r\nThus, in our study, patients with alcohol-dependence with reduced DA D2 receptor function, as assessed by the GH response to APO, did have significantly lower platelet MAO-B activity in comparison to those patients with normal DA D2 receptor function. This finding is, however, in disagreement with the report by Farren and Dinan (1996) in which, as mentioned earlier, no difference was found between alcoholics with blunted and non-blunted GH responses to bromocriptine. The reason(s) for this discrepancy is unknown. There have been numerous studies of platelet MAO-B activity in alcoholics or in subtypes of alcoholics and the results of these studies have been contradictory. Platelet MAO-B activity has been shown to be either decreased in alcoholics or no different from that in controls (see e.g. Anthenelli et al., 1998Go).\r\n\r\nIn the recent study by Anthenelli et al. (1998), it was reported that cigarette smoking, but not alcohol dependence, is associated with decreased platelet MAO-B activity, and it was thus concluded that decreased platelet MAO-B activity is not a trait marker for alcoholism or its subtypes, but rather a state marker of cigarette smoking. This is not in agreement with the results from the present study, where platelet MAO-B activity did not differ between smokers (4.9 \xb1 0.8 \xb5kat/kg protein; n = 5) and non-smokers (4.0 \xb1 1.6 \xb5kat/kg protein; n = 9). The present report therefore suggests that alcoholics with reduced DA D2 receptor function may be the subgroup of alcohol-dependent individuals who have low platelet MAO-B activity.\r\n\r\nFinally, from a neurobiological point of view, it is of interest that platelet MAO-B activity and the GH response to DA D2 receptor agonists are two methods for assessment of DA function in alcoholics, as mentioned by Farren and Dinan (1996). Platelet MAO-B activity has been reported to be highly correlated with brain MAO-B activity in humans (Bench et al., 1991Go). Since MAO-B activity is involved in the metabolism of DA in the presynaptic neuron, it is tempting to speculate on the possibility that the reduced platelet MAO-B activity, which reflects brain MAO-B activity, represents an adaptive mechanism to the reduced postsynaptic DA D2 receptor function. Thus, the presynaptic DA neuron reduces the metabolism of DA in order to increase the amount of the neurotransmitter available for release, in order to compensate for the down-regulated postsynaptic DA D2 receptor function and thereby maintain a normal level of central DA neurotransmission.""",0
"b""Isabella Leitch's paper1 is exciting reading in many ways. Our main difficulty in writing this commentary was choosing a single topic from her several original ideas that have major relevance to the nutritional problems of developing countries today. We opted to discuss the possible hazards of catch-up growth.\r\n\r\nLeitch's analogy of the growth of pigs and humans is thought-provoking. Based on research on pigs who were starved early in life and then fed appropriately, she observed that \x91skeleton and muscle will not grow as they would have done if they had had the opportunity at the right time, and the extra food will be used mainly to lay on fat\x92. She then uses this analogy of the \x91low\x96high\x92 pig to propose that humans who suffered malnutrition in early life would be better off by remaining thin than by putting on weight: \x91growth potential is not something that one can speed up and slow down ... and get the same result in the end\x92. She concludes by arguing that this condition \x91can probably be prevented only by the continuation of a spartan regime throughout life, which seems a bit hard\x92.\r\n\r\nLeitch's \x91low\x96high human\x92 has short legs, since leg length is more heavily compromised by malnutrition than trunk (or crown-rump) length. Her discussion of the aesthetic appeal of long legs and of its associated health benefits is both amusing and scientifically challenging.\r\n\r\nRecent data suggest that low\x96high humans are indeed becoming increasingly prevalent, as obesity rapidly escalates in developing countries2,3 affecting individuals who also faced childhood malnutrition. Although small size at birth is not usually associated with greater adiposity in adults,4 children who are stunted in early childhood may have a greater risk of later obesity in countries undergoing the nutrition transition. Studies from Brazil, China, Russia and South Africa suggest that stunted children have a 2\x968 times greater risk of becoming overweight.5 In Guatemala, stunted children are particularly prone to central fatness as adults.6 Leitch's low\x96high human might well be referred to as the \x91stunted\x96obese\x92 human.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, it is useful to distinguish two types of catch-up growth. Early catch-up refers to children who are born small but catch up in weight and height in infancy or early childhood. Late catch-up affects children who may or may not be born small, but who became stunted in infancy or childhood and catch up later in weight but not in height, becoming \x91stunted\x96 obese\x92.\r\n\r\nIn less developed countries, about one in every four newborns is growth-retarded.7 Growth monitoring programmes provide nutritional advice to mothers whose children are underweight or not gaining weight as expected.8,9 For children aged 6 months or older, this implies providing additional energy-dense and micronutrient-rich foods to promote catch-up growth.10 Since measuring child length in first-level health facilities is problematic, weight-for-age is used to assess risk and progress. Growth promotion programmes do not differentiate early from late catch-up and provide feeding advice to all malnourished children under 5 years. They have been strongly endorsed by the international paediatric and nutrition communities, and by agencies such as WHO and UNICEF during the last 30 years.\r\n\r\nLeitch is concerned primarily with the long-term effects of late catch-up. Her hypothesis is consistent with the rapid increase in chronic disease that is already taking place in developing countries,11\x9613 and with the well-known detrimental effects of trunk and upper body fatness.14 However, recent literature arising from the Barker hypothesis15 suggests that early catch-up may also be detrimental. This is cause for much greater concern.""",3
"b'The feto-acinar pancreatic protein or FAPP, the oncofetal glycoisoform of bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL), is characterized by the presence of the J28 glycotope recognized by mAbJ28. This fucosylated epitope is carried out by the O-linked glycans of the C-terminal mucin-like region of BSDL. This glycotope is expressed by human tumoral pancreatic tissues and by human pancreatic tumoral cell lines such as SOJ-6 and BxPC-3 cells. However, it is not expressed by the normal human pancreatic tissues and by MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells. Due to the presence of many putative sites for O-glycosylation on FAPP and BSDL, the structure of the J28 glycotope cannot be attained by classical physical methods. In the first part of the present study, we have determined which glycosyltransferases were differently expressed in pancreatic tumoral cell lines compared to normal tissues, focusing in part on fucosyltransferases (Fuc-T) and core-2 [beta]6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core2GlcNAc-T). Our data suggested that [alpha]2-Fuc-T activity was decreased in the four cell lines tested (SOJ-6, BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, and Panc-1). The [alpha](1-3) and [alpha](1-4) fucosylations were decreased in tumor cells that do not express the J28 glycotope whereas [alpha]4-Fuc-T and Core2GlcNAc-T activities were significantly increased in SOJ-6 cells which best expressed the J28 glycotope. Therefore, we wished to gain information about glycosyltransferases involved in the building of this structure by transfecting the cDNA encoding the mucin-like region of BSDL in CHO-K1 also expressing Core2GlcNAc-T and/or FUT3 and/or FUT7 activities. These CHO-K1 cells have been previously transfected with the cDNA encoding Core2GlcNAc-T and/or FUT3 and/or FUT7. Data indicated that the C-terminal peptide of BSDL (Cter) produced by those cells did not carry out the J28 glycotope unless Core2GlcNAc-T activity is present. Further transfection with FUT3 cDNA, increased the antibody recognition. Nevertheless, transfection with FUT3 or FUT7 alone did not generate the formation of the J28 glycotope on the C-terminal peptide. Furthermore, the Cter peptide produced by CHO-K1 cells expressing Core2GlcNAc-T was more reactive to the mAbJ28 after in vitro fucosylation with the recombinant soluble form of FUT3. These data suggested that the J28 glycotope encompasses structures initiated by Core2GlcNAc-T and further fucosylated by [alpha]3/4-Fuc-T such as FUT3, likely on GlcNAc residues.'",2
"b'Early generated layers of neocortex are important factors in forming the subsequent architecture of the cerebral cortex. To further explore the role of early generated cortex, we disrupted formation of an early generated cohort of cells by intraperitoneal injections of the mitotic inhibitor methylazoxymethanol (MAM) into pregnant ferrets timed to coincide with generation of subplate neurons in the ventricular zone. Our studies demonstrate that if early development of the neocortex is interrupted by injection of MAM during embryogenesis (on embryonic day 24 or 28; E24 or E28), a distinct laminar pattern fails to form properly in the parietal cortex. A reduced number of MAP2-positive cells were observed in the region of the subplate when compared with the number of MAP2-positive cells found in normal animals. Interference with the superficial neocortical layers that form later during development (on embryonic day 33) by appropriately timed MAM injections does not result in a severely disrupted laminar pattern. The interrupted laminar pattern that arises after early MAM injections coincides with distorted radial glial cells (identified by immunoreactivity to the intermediate filament protein, vimentin), which occur after early, but not late, MAM injections. Further analysis suggests that interference with early development of neocortex leads to premature differentiation of radial glial cells into astrocytes, as demonstrated by the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Experiments involving injections of the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU), demonstrated that 4 days after E24 MAM injection cells are generated and migrate into the thin cortical plate. By E38, however, cells continue to be generated in animals treated with MAM on E24 but do not reach their normal positions in the cortical plate. In addition, immunoreactivity using the CR50 antibody, which identifies presumptive Cajal\x96Retzius cells present in layer 1, demonstrates that the CR50-positive cells, normally precisely located in the outer portion of layer 1, are distributed in disarray throughout the thickness of the neocortex and intermediate zone in early MAM-treated animals, but not in those treated with MAM injections later during gestation. These findings are consistent with the idea that early generated layers are important in providing factors that maintain the environment necessary for subsequent neuronal migration and formation of neocortical layers.'",1
"b'In addition to the established areas of endogenous psychoses, the concept of abnormal hemispheric organization in the field of psychiatry is also generating ever greater interest in the area of research into addiction. On the basis of the demonstrably higher rate of developmental risk factors (pre-, peri-, postnatal), in particular the marker left-handedness (LH) has been interpreted as an indication of induced hemispheric \x91malcontrol\x92 in endogenous psychoses. In various studies, elevated rates of LH have also been shown in alcoholics. Alcoholism could be related to biological factors associated with anomalous cerebral dominance. In a joint study carried out by the Anton Proksch Institut in Vienna (Austria), and the University of Erlangen\x96Nuremberg (Germany) involving a total of 250 alcohol-dependent inpatients, the hypothesis of deviant laterality in the presence of an elevated frequency of developmental risk factors has been confirmed exclusively in male alcoholics. A comparison of subtypes has also revealed that Type IV in the Lesch typology, and Type II in the Cloninger classification, are more vulnerable subtypes. These results clearly show that there are differences to be found within the overall group of alcoholics, and underscore the need for subtyping and gender-specific studies.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""Lesion evidence indicates that words from different lexical categories, such as nouns and verbs, may have different cortical counterparts. In this study, processing of nouns and verbs was investigated in the intact brain using (i) behavioral measures, (ii) stimulus-triggered event-related potentials and (iii) high-frequency electrocortical responses in the gamma band. Nouns and verbs carefully matched for various variables, including word frequency, length, arousal and valence, were presented in a lexical decision task while electrocortical responses were recorded. In addition, information about cognitive processing of these stimuli was obtained using questionnaires and reaction times. As soon as ~200 ms after stimulus onset, event-related potentials disclosed electrocortical differences between nouns and verbs over widespread cortical areas. In a later time window, 500\x96800 ms after stimulus onset, there was a significant difference between high-frequency responses in the 30 Hz range. Difference maps obtained from both event-related potentials and high-frequency responses revealed strong betweencategory differences of signals recorded above motor and visual cortices. Behavioral data suggest that these different physiological responses are related to semantic associations (motor or visual) elicited by these word groups. Our results are consistent with a neurobiological model of language representation postulating cell assemblies with distinct cortical topographies as biological counterparts of words. Assemblies representing nouns referring to visually perceived objects may include neurons in visual cortices, and assemblies representing action verbs may include additional neurons in motor, premotor and prefrontal cortices. Event-related potentials and high-frequency responses are proposed to indicate two different functional states of cell assemblies: initial full activation (`ignition') and continuous reverberatory activity.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'The catalytic {alpha} and glycoprotein \xdf subunits of the gastric H/K ATPase are major molecular targets in human and mouse autoimmune gastritis. We have previously shown that the H/K ATPase \xdf subunit is required for the initiation of mouse gastritis and identified a gastritogenic H/K ATPase \xdf subunit peptide (H/K\xdf253\x96277). Here we report the generation of MHC class II-restricted TCR transgenic mice using V{alpha}9 and V\xdf8.3 TCR chains with specificity for the gastritogenic H/K\xdf253\x96277 peptide. We found an 8-fold reduction in CD4+ T cells in the thymus of the transgenic mice. Despite the reduction in intrathymic CD4+ T cells, V\xdf8.3-expressing T cells comprised the majority (>90%) of peripheral spleen and lymph node T cells. These peripheral T cells retained their capacity to proliferate in vitro to the H/K\xdf253\x96277 peptide. Using the responsive T cells, we have restricted the gastritogenic T cell epitope to H/K\xdf261\x96274. Despite the capacity of the peripheral T cells to proliferate in vitro to the peptide, the majority (~80%, 13 of 16) of transgenic mice remained free of gastritis while a minority (20%, three of 16) spontaneously developed an invasive and destructive gastritis. Our results confirm that H/K\xdf261\x96274 is a gastritogenic peptide. The data also suggest that CD4 T cell tolerance to the gastritogenic peptide in the transgenic mice is maintained by a combination of intrathymic and peripheral tolerance mechanisms.'",4
"b""Aim and Methods To discuss evidence for and against genetic \x91causes\x92 of type 2 diabetes, illustrated by standardized study of glucose intolerance and high blood pressure in four representative African origin populations. Comparison of two genetically closer sites: rural (site 1) and urban Cameroon (2); then Jamaica (3) and Caribbean migrants to Britain (80% from Jamaica\x974).\r\n\r\nBackground Alternatives to the reductionist search for genetic \x91causes\x92 of chronic disease include Rose's concept that populations give rise to \x91sick\x92 individuals. Twin studies offer little support to genetic hypotheses because monozygotic twins share more than genes in utero and suffer from ascertainment bias. Non-genetic intergenerational mechanisms include amniotic fluid growth factors and maternal exposures. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension incidence accelerate in low-risk European populations from body mass >=23 kg/m2, well within \x91desirable\x92 limits. Transition from subsistence agriculture in West Africa occurred this century and from western hemisphere slavery only six generations ago, with slow escape from intergenerational poverty since.\r\n\r\nResults \x91Caseness\x92 increased clearly within and between genetically similar populations: age-adjusted diabetes rates were 0.8, 2.4, 8.5 and 16.4% for sites 1\x964, respectively; for \x91hypertension\x92, rates were 7, 16, 21 and 34%, with small shifts in risk factors. Body mass index rose similarly.\r\n\r\nConclusion Energy imbalance and intergenerational socioeconomic influences are much more likely causes of diabetes (and most chronic disease) than ethnic/genetic variation, which does occur, poorly related to phenotype. The newer method of \x91proteomics\x92 holds promise for identifying environmental triggers influencing gene products. Even in lower prevalence \x91westernized\x92 societies, genetic screening per se for diabetes/chronic disease is likely to be imprecise and inefficient hence unreliable and expensive.""",3
"b'Background To compare the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) paediatric classification system with the long-term course of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.\r\n\r\nMethods Prospective study on 366 perinatally infected children followed-up from birth and checked at least every 2 months. Survival, smoothed hazard, adjusted hazard ratio of death, and transition probabilities in clinical and immunological categories were outcome measures.\r\n\r\nResults Survival was 49% (95% CI : 40\x9658%) at 8 years. The risk of death was high before the age of 2, relatively low between ages 2 and 7, and contained thereafter. Children did not advance through the categories sequentially. Survival at 8 years was 61.7% (95% CI : 49.8\x9673.6%) in those children who had passed through clinical category A; the hazard ratio of death was 2.5 (95% CI : 1.7\x963.8) for 175 (47.9%) children who skipped this category. Transition probability in clinical category B was 39.9% (95% CI : 32.3\x9645.6%) after one year, but 59.1% (95% CI : 51.4\x9666.8%) after 5 years. Before 2 years of age, the probability of entry into category C (40%; 95% CI : 35\x9645%) was higher than that of entry into immunological category 3 (28%; 95% CI : 22\x9634%).\r\n\r\nConclusions The classification system stands comparison with the clinical reality, but the CD4-positive cell thresholds in infancy should be adjusted and category B indicator diseases better distributed to improve their predictive value.'",3
"b'Background Few studies have examined the influence of country of birth and acculturation status on indicators of obesity using national samples of Mexican\x96American women and men.\r\n\r\nMethods We analysed data for 1387 Mexican\x96American women and 1404 Mexican\x96 American men, ages 25\x9664, from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\x961994). We examined whether waist circumference and abdominal obesity varied by country of birth and acculturation status (primary language spoken), and whether among those with abdominal obesity, number of associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors varied by country of birth and acculturation status.\r\n\r\nResults Both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation status were significantly associated with waist circumference and abdominal obesity. Mexican-born women and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm respectively), US-born English-speaking women and men had intermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and US-born Spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for age, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking. All women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly US-born Spanish-speaking women (68.7%). In addition, US-born Spanish-speaking women with abdominal obesity were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have one or more of the following CVD risk factors: high serum insulin, non-insulin dependent diabetes, high blood lipids, and/or hypertension.\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings illustrate the heterogeneity of the Mexican\x96American population and suggest that country of birth and lack of acculturation to the majority culture, as well as secondary lifestyle changes, may explain the significant clinical differences observed in abdominal obesity within Mexican\x96American population subgroups.'",3
"b'To investigate brain mechanisms of sound location memory, we studied the distribution of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in subjects performing an audiospatial n-back task with three memory load levels. Working memory processing of audiospatial information activated areas in the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, and in the posterior parietal and middle temporal cortices. In a control experiment, fMRI during audio- and visuospatial 2-back task performances revealed only few differentially activated subregions between the two tasks. These results demonstrate that working memory processing of auditory locations involves a distributed network of brain areas and suggest that mnemonic processing of audio- and visuospatial information is directed along a common neural pathway in the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices.'",1
"b""T cell neonatal tolerance to self evolves perturbation of the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2-type self-specific T cells. In the current study we have demonstrated that a tolerant state could be extended to another encephalitogenic determinant only if the neonatally tolerizing determinant was co-administered in adult life with an emulsion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (i.e. complete Freund's adjuvant). The mechanisms underlying tolerance elicitation and expansion were then explored by an in vitro system in which indirect suppression could be measured. Addition of a tolerizing epitope to splenic T cells from neonatally tolerized animals induced a marked suppression of the anti-MT response. This response could be restored by neutralizing antibodies to IL-4. In contrast, the neutralizing antibodies to IL-4 had no affect on the response of these cells to the tolerizing determinant. These findings are highly significant not only because they explore the important role of microbial antigens in neonatal tolerance, but also because they distinguish, for the first time, between tolerizing and tolerized T cells.""",4
"b'The pattern of cognitive deficits and their time-dependent recovery were investigated in a cohort of 49 male alcohol-dependent patients using a repeated measurement design with 49 healthy male controls matched for age, education, and marital status. We combined parts of the Halstead Reitan Battery and the Wechsler Memory Scale with tests that are widely used in German-speaking countries. Patients were tested in the first week (T1) and 5 weeks later (T2) at the end of the in-patient treatment programme. Matched controls were tested also at T1 and T2, which enabled us to take learning effects into account. At T1, the patients showed distinct cognitive deficits on 5 of 12 neuropsychological parameters (perceptual-motor speed, verbal short-term memory, verbal knowledge, non-verbal reasoning, spatial imagination). At T2, significant improvements had occurred in four of the five dysfunctional domains with a significant difference remaining in verbal short-term memory. Duration of dependency and length of abstinence prior to testing had no essential effects on neuropsychological functions. Our results provide evidence for the well-established fact that chronic alcoholism has detrimental effects on cognitive performance, but that performance improves with neuropsychological recovery which occurs rapidly within weeks when abstinence is maintained. Cognitive deficits seem to be similar across different studies and cultures.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Background Oropharyngeal carriage studies of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and the rapid drop in Hib invasive disease in countries with widespread Hib conjugate vaccine immunization programmes for infants have indicated there may be significant indirect effects (herd immunity) associated with these vaccines. Our goal was to quantify the magnitude of these effects in an American Indian population during its early years of Hib immunization.\r\n\r\nMethods In a synthetic case-cohort study, we combined data from an efficacy trial, an immunization uptake records survey, and ongoing surveillance for Hib disease on the Navajo Nation from 1988 to 1992. Decline in the incidence of invasive Hib disease among children <2 years old was estimated via proportional hazards survival models as a function of individual immunization status and the proportion of immunized children in a community.\r\n\r\nResults The predominant vaccine during the study period was Hib-OMPC (92% of immunizations). The effectiveness of receipt of at least one dose was 97.2%. Compared to communities with 0\x9620% coverage with at least one dose, residence in communities with 20\x9640% and 40\x9660% coverage was associated with risk reductions of 56.5% and 73.2%, respectively.\r\n\r\nConclusions The results indicate substantial indirect effects of Hib-OMPC immunization may occur even at relatively low levels of immunization coverage. Countries that implement Hib immunization programmes may receive greater benefits at the community level than those due to the direct protection conferred to the individual through vaccination.'",3
"b'As part of a study of protein-carbohydrate interactions, linear N-acetyl-polyllactosamines [Gal[beta]1,4GlcNAc[beta]1,3]n were synthesized at the 10-100 \xb5mol scale using enzymatic methods. The methods described also provided specifically [1-13C]-galactose-labeled tetra- and hexasaccharides ([1-13C]-Gal[beta]1,4GlcNAc[beta]1,3Gal[beta]1,4Glc and Gal[beta]1,4GlcNAc[beta]1,3[1-13C]Gal[beta]1,4GlcNAc[beta]1,3Gal[beta]1,4Glc) suitable for NMR studies. Two series of oligosaccharides were produced, with either glucose or N-acetlyglucosamine at the reducing end. In both cases, large amounts of starting primer were available from human milk oligosaccharides (trisaccharide primer GlcNAc[beta]1,3Gal[beta]1,4Glc) or via transglycosylation from N-acetyllactosamine. Partially purified and immobilized glycosyltransferases, such as bovine milk [beta]1,4 galactosyltransferase and human serum [beta]1,3 N- acetylglucosaminyltransferase, were used for the synthesis. All the oligo-saccharide products were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The target molecules were then used to study their interactions with recombinant galectin-1, and initial 1H NMR spectroscopic results are presented to illustrate this approach. These results indicate that, for oligomers containing up to eight sugars, the principal interaction of the binding site of galectin-1 is with the terminal N-acetyllactosamine residues.'",2
"b'Background Several countries have reported an increase in life expectancy at advanced ages. This paper analyses recent changes in life expectancy at age 60 and 85 in The Netherlands, a low mortality country with reliable mortality data.\r\n\r\nMethods We used data on the population and the number of deaths by age, sex and underlying cause of death for 1970\x961994. Life expectancy at age 60 and 85 was estimated using standard life-table techniques. The contribution of different ages and causes of death to the change in life expectancy during the 1970s (1970/74\x96 1980/84) and the 1980s (1980/84\x961990/94) were estimated with a decomposition technique developed by Arriaga.\r\n\r\nResults Life expectancy at age 60 increased in the 1970s and 1980s, whereas life expectancy at age 85 decreased (men) and stagnated (women) in the 1980s, and has decreased in both sexes since 1985/89. The decomposition by age showed that constant mortality rates in women aged 85\x9689, and increasing mortality rates at ages 85+ (men) and 90+ (women) have caused this lack of increase in life expectancy. The decomposition by cause of death showed that smaller mortality reductions from other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which contributed most to the increase in life expectancy at age 85 in the 1970s, and mortality increases from, amongst others, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mental disorders and diabetes mellitus produced the decrease (men) and plateau (women) in life expectancy at age 85.\r\n\r\nConclusions Life expectancy at advanced ages stopped increasing during the 1980s in The Netherlands due to mortality increases at ages 85+ (men) and 90+ (women). Cause-specific trends suggest that, in addition to (past) smoking behaviour in men, changes in the distribution of morbidity and frailty in the population might have contributed to this stagnation.'",3
"b'Background Most previous studies on marital status and mortality did not adjust for the effect of \x91marital selection\x92. Little research has been done about the relation between marital status and mortality in British women, with the exception of research on bereavement.\r\n\r\nMethods Subjects consisted of women aged >=35 in a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample. Marital status and covariates were enumerated at a baseline interview in 1984/85 and a follow-up interview in 1991/92. Death data up to May 1997 were obtained from the National Health Service Central Register. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the single, divorced and widowed states in relation to the married state.\r\n\r\nResults Having adjusted for age and martial selection factors, being single (HR = 1.45) was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality. Being divorced and being widowed showed no excess mortality risk (each HR = 1.09).\r\n\r\nConclusions Being single was associated with higher mortality. A causal interpretation is plausible. Being divorced and being widowed were not associated with higher mortality.'",3
"b'We found previously that short-term (3 and 6 h) exposure to ethanol (100 and 200 mM) induced the transient arrest of L929 cells at the G2+M phase. To identify the exact site blocked during the G2+M phase, we carried out flow cytometry and microscopic analysis with asynchronous L929 cells exposed to ethanol (12.5\x96330 mM) for 3, 6 or 24 h. Flow cytometry (the simultaneous analysis of cellular DNA and cyclin B1 content) revealed that the percentage of 4c (tetraploid) cells with a high level of cyclin B1 increased after continuous 6 h exposure to ethanol (>=82.5 mM) and decreased after 24 h exposure, which supports the idea of a transient M-phase block. To determine the sub-M phase of 4c cells with high levels of cyclin B1 based on spindle microtubules and their karyotype, we viewed immunofluorescent images by double staining with Hoechst 33258 (bis-benzimide trihydrochloride) for DNA and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled antibody for cyclin B1 or \xdf-tubulin. A 6 h exposure to intermediate concentrations (50\x96100 mM) of ethanol increased the number of early-anaphase cells, compared with the control, suggesting an inhibition of the elongation of polar microtubules. Both 6 and 24 h exposure to higher concentrations (100\x96200 mM) of ethanol increased metaphase cells, indicating an arrest at the spindle assembly checkpoint and suggesting an inhibition of the shortening of kinetochore microtubules and/or the degradation of cyclin B1. Moreover, 6 h exposure to 330 mM ethanol increased round, probably early-prophase, cells, suggesting inhibition of the formation of spindle microtubules. Thus, it is likely that higher concentrations of ethanol affect the elongation, contraction, and formation of the spindle microtubules of L929 cells dose-dependently and also disrupt the correlation between microtubule organization and the synthesis and degradation of cyclin B1, thereby delaying the progress of karyokinesis, which may lead to an ethanol-induced G2+M block.'",0
"b'The main objective of this study was to compare platelet serotonin (5-HT) uptake between early-onset alcoholics (EOA) and late-onset alcoholics (LOA). Subjects were 24 dependent male alcoholic in-patients and 21 healthy control subjects. 5-HT uptake was quantified by incubating platelets with [3H]5-HT at various concentrations (0.5 to 1000 nM). 5-HT uptake was higher in EOA, compared to both the LOA and control groups (P < 0.02) at the highest 5-HT concentration (1000 nM). No significant difference was found between LOA and controls or between EOA + LOA and controls. Previous studies have shown that 5-HT uptake was higher in platelets, lymphocytes, and brain of alcoholics vs controls, but our data suggest that higher platelet serotonin transporter function is limited to EOA, not LOA.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The neuronal diversity of the subplate and developing white matter in the mouse was studied using a variety of neuronal markers. The subplate was first visible in lateral cortical areas at E13, coinciding with the emergence of the cortical plate. During prenatal development, this layer was formed by morphologically heterogeneous neurons, subsets of which were immunoreactive for GABA- and calcium-binding proteins. From E18 onwards, a few subplate cells also contained neuropeptides. Colocalization experiments demonstrated that the percentages of neurons immunoreactive for each antigen were similar to those described in adult neocortex. By E15, subplate cells had received synaptic contacts. Moreover, a second early-neuronal population was conspicuous from E13 in the lower intermediate zone: the intermediate\x96subventricular population. Unlike subplate cells, these neurons were morphologically uniform, smaller and horizontally oriented. Nevertheless, a few of these cells also appeared within the ventricular zone, with a perpendicular/ oblique orientation. Most of these cells were GABA-positive and showed calbindin immunoreactivity. At the electron microscopic level, no synaptic contacts were found in these neurons. Tracing studies using DiI showed that subplate neurons were the first to send axons outside the neocortex towards the ganglionic eminence at E13. At E14, subplate axons and ingrowing thalamic fibers met in the striate primordium. Subplate cells retained their projection to the thalamus during prenatal development. Thalamocortical axons reached the subplate at E15, and 1 day later began to invade the upper cortical layers. Early callosal axons, in contrast, did not run through the subplate to reach the contralateral hemisphere, nor did subplate cells send out callosal fibers. Callosal axons ran just above the subventricular zone, intermingled with the intermediate\x96subventricular neuronal population. We conclude that the subplate neuronal population has a chemical heterogeneity reminiscent of that of the adult cortex and is crucial to the establishment of thalamocortical relationships, whereas the intermediate\x96subventricular neurons constituted a particular GABAergic population, which includes resident cells and tangentially migrating postmitotic neurons spatially related to the development of callosal connections.'",1
"b'Donor T cells that are activated by host alloantigens initiate graft versus host disease (GVHD) but their long-term fate is poorly understood. The behavior of alloreactive donor T cells was studied in sublethally irradiated SCID mice. Intravenous injection of 106 allogeneic lymphocytes caused a severe form of GVHD, characterized by host hematopoietic atrophy. Fifty-fold fewer donor cells did not induce disease and were not simply rejected by radioresistant host mechanisms. Instead, low numbers of allogeneic T cells expanded 20- to 50-fold and remained for >1 year without causing evidence of GVHD. Persistent non-cycling donor cells with an activated phenotype were mainly found in the spleen. Tolerance was inferred by the recovery of host hematopoiesis, despite the presence of donor allogeneic T cells, and the inability of long-term persisting donor T cells to mediate cellular cytotoxicity or proliferate in response to exogenous IL-2 or antigenic stimulation in vitro. The TCR density of long-term persisting donor T cells was down-regulated. These findings suggest that the development of GVHD depends on the magnitude of the initial anti-host response. Subsequently donor cells differentiate, over several months, into a senescent-like state. This behavior questions the rationale for current treatment approaches to GVHD and is of relevance to any clinical situation where chronic T cell activation takes place in the absence of thymic development.'",4
"b""Ligands for a leukocyte adhesion molecule, L-selectin, are expressed not only in the specific vascular endothelium in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches but also in the extravascular tissues such as the brain white matter, choroid plexus and the kidney distal straight tubuli. However, the biological significance of these extravascular ligands is currently unknown. We now report the purification and characterization of a novel extravascular ligand for L-selectin in the kidney using a tubule-derived cell line, ACHN. Binding of L-selectin\x96IgG chimera (LEC\x96IgG) to the isolated ligand was specifically blocked with either (i) anti-L-selectin mAb, (ii) EDTA, (iii) fucoidan, (iv) chondroitin sulfate (CS) B or CS E, or (v) treatment with chondroitinases. Partial amino acid sequencing, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analyses showed that a major ligand for L-selectin in ACHN cells is versican of 1600 kDa. Histochemical as well as biochemical analyses verified that a versican subspecies in the kidney was indeed reactive with L-selectin. Studies with cell lines including those derived from the kidney indicated that a certain glycoform and/or splice form of versican is reactive with L-selectin. Under pathological conditions such as those induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, versican was shed from the distal straight tubuli and became localized in the adjacent vascular bundles around which a substantial leukocyte infiltration was concomitantly observed. Possible involvement of versican in leukocyte trafficking into the kidney under diseased conditions is discussed.""",4
"b'Accumulating evidence suggests that proteins tethered to the plasma membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors share common biological properties. In the present study we demonstrate that GPI-anchored proteins regulate T cell growth. Specifically, anti-TCR-induced proliferation was profoundly inhibited by co-immobilized mAb specific for Thy-1, CD48 and Ly6A/E. However, neither IL-2 production nor the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes was impaired in these circumstances. Analysis of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling pathway revealed that the association of IL-2R \xdf and {gamma} chains with the Janus kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, was not perturbed in the presence of mAb specific for GPI-linked proteins. However, in these conditions,\r\n\r\nIL-2-mediated recruitment of IL-2R{alpha}, \xdf and {gamma} chains, resulting in the formation of the high-affinity hetero-trimeric IL-2R, was inhibited. The resulting phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3, indicative of their activation states, was correspondingly reduced. These results characterize a novel state of T cell physiology in which effector function is maintained, in the absence of clonal expansion. A physiological role for GPI-anchored proteins in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and function is discussed.'",4
"b'Background To examine whether induced abortion increases the risk of low birthweight in subsequent singleton live births.\r\n\r\nMethods Cohort study using the Danish Medical Birth Registry (MBR), the Hospital Discharge Registry (HDR), and the Induced Abortion Registry (IAR). All women who had their first pregnancy during 1980\x961982 were identified in the MBR, the HDR, and the IAR. We included all 15 727 women whose pregnancy was terminated by a first trimester induced abortion in the induced abortion cohort and 46 026 women whose pregnancy was not terminated by an induced abortion were selected for the control cohort. All subsequent pregnancies until 1994 were identified by register record linkage.\r\n\r\nResults Low birthweight (<2500 g) in singleton term live births occurred more frequently in women with one, two, three or more previous induced abortions, compared with women without any previous induced abortion of similar gravidity, 2.2% versus 1.5%, 2.4% versus 1.7%, and 1.8% versus 1.6%, respectively. Adjusting for maternal age and residence at time of pregnancy, interpregnancy interval, gender of newborn, number of previous spontaneous abortions and number of previous low birthweight infants (control cohort only), the odds ratios (OR) of low birthweight in singleton term live births in women with one, two or more previous first trimester induced abortions were 1.9 (95% CI : 1.6, 2.3), and 1.9 (95% CI : 1.3, 2.7), respectively, compared with the control cohort of similar gravidity. High risks were mainly seen in women with an interpregnancy interval of more than 6 months.\r\n\r\nConclusions The findings suggest a positive association between one or more first trimester induced abortions and the risk of low birthweight in subsequent singleton term live births when the interpregnancy interval is longer than 6 months.

"b'The transcription factor cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) has been implicated in long-term plasticity processes in vertebrate and invertebrate species. In the absence of the alpha/delta CREB isoforms, performance is impaired in long-term memory tasks and the long-term maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the hippocampus. However, it is not known whether CREB plays a role in neocortical plasticity. Antibodies to CREB revealed that CREB-immunoreactive nuclei are present in all cortical layers but are more numerous in layers II/III, where they composed at least two-thirds the total population of cells. CREB-immunopositive cells were therefore present and densest in the very cortical layers that exhibit experience-dependent plasticity at this age. In order to assess the role of CREB in neocortical plasticity, we studied the effect of vibrissae deprivation on receptive field plasticity in the barrel cortex of mutant mice lacking the alpha/delta isoforms of CREB. A single vibrissa was spared and the others removed for 18 days. In wild-types this caused potentiation of the spared vibrissa response. However, in adult mutants (>6 months) spared vibrissa responses from homozygotes were potentiated less than in any adolescent animals or in adult wild-type littermates. Surround receptive field responses were abnormally large in homozygotes and failed to increase by the same amount as they did in wild-types. In contrast, the alpha/delta CREB mutation had no discernible effect on plasticity in cortical layers II/III of the younger adolescent age group (1\x962 months), suggesting that different plasticity processes may operate at this age. Further tests showed that the beta isoform of CREB was up-regulated in the barrel cortex of the alpha/delta CREB knock-outs, suggesting that this subunit may have compensated partly for the loss of the alpha/ delta isoforms. These studies suggests that CREB plays a role in experience-dependent plasticity in the adult neocortex.'",1
"b""IL-5, IL-10 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are known to activate B-1 cells in vivo in normal mice and anti-red blood cell autoantibody transgenic mice (HL mice).

In IL-5R{alpha}\x96/\x96 x HL mice, Ig-producing B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity were negligible, although the total number of B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity were as many as 30% of that in HL mice. Moreover, LPS- or IL-10-induced differentiation of B-1 cells into antibody-producing cells was severely impaired in IL-5R{alpha}\x96/\x96 x HL mice. We also used in vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling to estimate the proliferation of B-1 cells in IL-5R{alpha}\x96/\x96 mice. The absence of IL-5R{alpha} did not affect spontaneous proliferation of peritoneal B-1 cells. However, induced proliferation of peritoreal B-1 cells by oral administration of LPS was markedly impaired in IL-5R{alpha}\x96/\x96 mice. These results suggest that IL-5 is required for activation-associated proliferation of B-1 cells but not for their spontaneous proliferation and support the idea that IL-5 plays an important role on the induction of autoantibody production from B-1 cells.""",4

Following the suggestion that spines may \x91twitch\x92, it has been recently shown that spines are capable of rapid morphological rearrangements. Because of the role of the small GTPases from the Rho family in controlling neuronal morphogenesis, we investigated the effects of several members of this biochemical signaling pathway in the maintenance of the morphology of extant dendritic spines by combining biolistic transfection of pyramidal neurons in cultured cortical and hippocampal slices with two-photon microscopy. We find a variety of effects on the density and morphology of dendritic spines by expressing either constitutively active or dominant negative forms of several small GTPases of the Rho family, by blocking the entire pathway with Clostridium difficile toxin B or by blocking Rho with C3 transferase. We propose a model where Rac promotes spine formation, while Rho prevents it. We conclude that the small GTPases provide antagonistic control mechanisms of spine maintenance in pyramidal neurons.'",1
"b'Background It is unclear which of the number or the density of naevi on the skin is the more appropriate measure of risk of melanoma. Furthermore, the relationship between the number of naevi and their density in an individual has not been explored. Thus, for example, it is unknown if larger people tend to have more naevi by virtue of having a larger skin area, or if the density of naevi is similar in people of different body sizes. In this study, we explored the relationship between the number and the density of naevi in a sample of adolescents.\r\n\r\nSubjects and Methods A sample survey of naevi in 472 grade 9 secondary school students (aged 14\x9615 years) was conducted in Tasmania, Australia during 1992, and a subset of these individuals was followed up in 1997. Counts of naevi of various sizes were taken on the arm, leg, and back. Naevus density was estimated by using an algorithm to estimate body surface area from the height and weight of an individual. More general relationships of the naevus counts to height and weight were also explored. Finally, we considered whether the relationship between naevus density and the anthropometric variables could be confounded by exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\r\n\r\nResults The mean number of naevi was very similar in the two samples. Naevus density was slightly lower in the 1997 sample, mainly because of increasing body size in the cohort. The numbers of naevi were only weakly related to height and weight in males, and there was essentially no relationship in females. Regression analysis showed significant relationships of weight to the back naevus counts in males in 1992 and 1997, and to the arm naevus count in males in 1997; otherwise, none of the regression coefficients for height and weight were statistically significant. This picture did not change following adjustment for potentially confounding variables indicating time spent outdoors or in the sun. Furthermore, there was no evidence that time spent in the sun was related to the body mass index.\r\n\r\nConclusions It appears that the number and density of naevi in an individual are unrelated. Accordingly, with the present state of knowledge concerning the risk of melanoma, both the number and density of naevi should be considered as equally valid in future studies as markers of the risk of melanoma, and in studies on the natural history of naevi. If the disease mechanism is systemic, and not related to particular naevi, naevus density might form the better marker of risk. However, if the disease mechanism is related to effects on particular naevi, then the risk would vary in proportion to the number of naevi.'",3
"b'In the primary visual cortex of higher mammals, orientation preferences are represented continuously except for singular points, so-called pinwheel centers. In spite of the uniqueness of orientation pinwheel centers, very little is known about the pattern of their arrangement. In this study we examined the arrangement of orientation pinwheel centers in the cat visual cortex by optical imaging of intrinsic signals. Our results demonstrate that orientation pinwheel centers are arranged in a unique geometric pattern around the area 17/18 transition zone: pinwheel centers of the same type are arranged in rows parallel to the transition zone, and rows of clockwise and counterclockwise pinwheel centers are arranged alternately. We suggest that the areal border imposes a strong restriction on the pattern formation of orientation preference maps in the visual cortex.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The expression of type-1 Lewis antigens on erythrocytes and in digestive organs is determined by a Lewis type [alpha](1,3/1,4)-fucosyltransferase (Lewis enzyme) encoded by the Fuc-TIII gene (FUT3 gene; Lewis gene). We have classified the Lewis alleles in the Japanese population into four types, the wild-type allele (Le) and three mutated alleles, i.e., le1, which has missense mutations T59G and G508A, le2, which has T59G and T1067A, and le3, which has only T59G. Here we carried out an extensive study on the biological properties of the three mutant Lewis enzymes, the le1, le2, and le3 enzymes, using native tissues and obtained the following results. (1) In in vivo and in vitro experiments, the le1 and le2 enzymes were found to be susceptible to protease digestion probably because the one missense mutation in the catalytic domains, i.e., Gly170 to Ser in the le1 enzyme and Ile356 to Lys in the le2 enzyme, makes the three-dimensional structures of the enzymesunstable, while the le3 and wild-type Lewis enzymes wereresistant to protease digestion. (2) The le1 and le2 enzymes cannot synthesize type 1 Lewis antigens on either glycolipids or mucins. The le3 enzyme cannot synthesize Lewis-active glycolipids, which result in the Lewis antigen-negative phenotype of erythrocytes, while it can synthesize Lewis antigens on mucins in normal and cancerous colon tissues. The missense mutation, Leu20 to Arg, in the transmembrane domain reduces retention of the le3 enzyme in the Golgi membrane resulting in an apparent reduction of enzyme activity as revealed by the lack of Lewis antigen synthesis. (3) The Lewis gene dosage actually has effects in vivo on the amount of the Lewis enzyme, its activity, and finally the amounts of Lewis carbohydrate antigens. This is the first article that clearly demonstrates the gene dosage effects on the amount of the glycosyltransferase protein, its activity, and the amounts of carbohydrate products in vivo.'",2
"b'Background To explore Bacillus Calmette-Gu\xe9rin vaccine (BCG) as a protective factor against tuberculosis (TB) and how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection modifies the effect of BCG on TB.\r\n\r\nMethods Two matched case-control studies were conducted. One study compared TB cases and controls who were HIV positive. The second compared TB cases and controls who were HIV negative. The study population consisted of 88 TB cases and 88 controls among HIV-positive individuals and 314 TB cases and 310 controls among HIV-negative individuals. Cases were new TB diagnoses, confirmed by either bacteriology, pathology, radiology or clinical response to treatment; controls were selected from people without TB symptoms and who sought medical attention in the same institution where a case was enrolled. BCG was assessed by the presence of a typical scar.\r\n\r\nResults The level of protection against all clinical forms of TB was 22% among HIV positive individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, 95% CI : 0.48\x961.26) and 26% among HIV negatives (OR = 0.74, 95% CI : 0.52\x961.05). There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in the level of protection against extrapulmonary TB (ETB) between HIV-negative (OR = 0.54, 95% CI : 0.32\x960.93) and HIV-positive individuals (OR = 1.36, 95% CI : 0.72\x962.57).\r\n\r\nConclusion BCG has a modest protective effect against all forms of TB independent of HIV status, and BCG confers protection against extrapulmonary TB among HIV-negative individuals. However, HIV infection seems to abrogate the protective effect of BCG against extrapulmonary TB. Our data support the public health importance of BCG vaccine in the prevention of extrapulmonary TB among immunocompetent individuals.'",3
"b'The mannose/glucose-binding Dolichos lablab lectin (designated DLL) has been purified from seeds of Dolichos lablab (hyacinth bean) to electrophoretic homogeneity by affinity chromatography on an ovalbumin-Sepharose 4B column. The purified lectin gave a single symmetric protein peak with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa on gel filtration chromatography, and five bands ranging from 10 kDa to 22 kDa upon SDS-PAGE. N-Terminal sequence analysis of these bands revealed subunit heterogeneity due to posttranslational proteolytic truncation at different sites mostly at the carboxyl terminus. The carbohydrate binding properties of the purified lectin were investigated by three different approaches: hemagglutination inhibition assay, quantitative precipitation inhibition assay, and ELISA. On the basis of these studies, it is concluded that the Dolichos lablab lectin has neither an extended carbohydrate combining site, nor a hydrophobic binding site adjacent to it. The carbohydrate combining site of DLL appears to most effectively accommodate a nonreducing terminal [alpha]-d-mannosyl unit, and to be complementary to the C-3, C-4, and C-6 equatorial hydroxyl groups of [alpha]-d-mannopyranosyl and [alpha]-d-glucopyranosyl residues. DLL strongly precipitates murine IgM but not IgG, and the recent finding that this lectin interacts specifically with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the Flt3 tyrosine kinase receptor and preserves human cord blood stem cells and progenitors in a quiescent state for prolonged periods in culture, make this lectin a valuable tool in biomedical research.'",2
"b'Collagen type II (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice is a model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which the role of T lymphocytes remains controversial. To clarify this, we have bred a targeted gene deletion of TCR \xdf or {delta} loci into two mouse strains susceptible to CIA, the B10.Q and DBA/1 strains. The TCR\xdf\x96/\x96 mice lacked {alpha}\xdf T cells, which was compensated by an expansion of B cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells and NK cells. The \xdf\x96/\x96 mice, but not control \xdf+/\x96 littermates, were completely resistant to CIA. The production of anti-CII IgG antibodies was also abolished in \xdf\x96/\x96 mice, revealing a strict {alpha}\xdf T cell dependency. In contrast, \xdf\x96/\x96 mice produced reduced, but significant, anti-CII IgM titers after immunization with either CII or ovalbumin, indicating a multispecificity for these {alpha}\xdf T cell-independent IgM antibodies. The TCR{delta}\x96/\x96 mice lacked {gamma}{delta} T cells but had no other significant changes in lymphocyte or monocyte subsets. The cytokine response (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-{gamma}) in {delta}\x96/\x96 mice, quantified by flow cytometry staining of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, was indistinguishable from normal mice. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were observed in CIA between mice lacking {gamma}{delta} T cells and control littermates, considering arthritis incidence, day of disease onset, maximum arthritic score, anti-CII IgG titers and disease course. We conclude that {alpha}\xdf T cells are necessary for CIA development and for an IgG response towards CII, whereas {gamma}{delta} T cells are neither necessary nor sufficient for development of CIA.'",4
"b'This experiment examined the effect of electrical kindling on the morphology of frontal (Fr1) neocortical layer III pyramidal cell dendrites in both male and female rats. Repeated elicitation of afterdischarge resulted in an increase in the severity of the behavioural seizures and an increase in afterdischarge duration, frequency and amplitude in all rats. The late component of the transcallosal evoked responses also increased following both 7 and 25 kindling sessions in male rats and following 25 kindling sessions in female rats. Analysis of the Golgi\x96Cox impregnated pyramidal cell dendrites indicated a significant decrease in the amount of apical and basilar dendritic spine density, length and branching in female rats following 7 days, but not 25 days, of kindling. Male rats had significantly lower apical and basilar dendritic spine density and branching measures following 25 days, but not 7 days, of kindling, as well as significantly lower apical and basilar dendritic length following 7 days of kindling. The differential gender effect suggests that males and females recruit similar plastic mechanisms although at different times in response to electrical kindling.'",1
"b'Brefeldin A reversibly disassembles the Golgi complex, causing mixing of the Golgi cisternae with the ER while the trans Golgi network persists as part of a separate endosomal membrane system. Because of this compartmental separation, Brefeldin A treatment has been used to map the sub-Golgi locations of several Golgi enzymes including GM2 synthase. We previously proposed that GM2 synthase might be located in a distal portion of the Golgi complex which in the presence of Brefeldin A would be separated from the substrate ganglioside GM3 present in the mixed ER-Golgi membrane system. In the present study we show using GM2 synthase chimeras that GM2 synthesis was blocked by Brefeldin A when GM2 synthase was distributed throughout all Golgi subcompartments or even when it was restricted to the medial Golgi. Because these findings opposed our speculation regarding a distal location of this enzyme, we sought an alternative explanation for the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis by Brefeldin A. However, Brefeldin A did not degrade GM2 synthase, prevent its homodimerization, or inhibit its in vitro activity. Brefeldin A did result in the conversion of a portion of membrane bound GM2 synthase into a soluble form which has minimal capability to produce GM2 in whole cells. However, this conversion was not sufficient to explain the nearly total loss of GM2 production in intact cells in the presence of Brefeldin A. Nevertheless, the results of this study indicate that Brefeldin A-induced inhibition of ganglioside synthesis cannot be used to deduce the location of GM2 synthase.'",2
"b""It is widely reported that women drink less and have a lower prevalence of drink problems than men, but the gender differences in the relationship between level of drinking and drink problems have rarely been investigated quantitatively. This paper reports results from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (the 1946 British Cohort) when the subjects were 43 years old. Using 7-day recall for alcohol consumption and CAGE scores of 2, 3 or 4 for drink problems, it was found that the prevalence of drink problems increased with level of alcohol consumption. Women were more likely than men to report drink problems at the same level of alcohol consumption. However, this gender difference was largely accounted for by individual differences in weight of body water. Beer accounted for the excess of men's drinking over women's and the proportion of alcohol consumed as beer was inversely related to drink problems. Eighty per cent of women and 52% of men who had drink problems in the past year reported drinking less than an average of 3 U (women) or 4 U (men) a day in the past week. As drinking levels in women begin to approach those in men, rates of drink problems in women are likely to overtake those in men because of women's greater physiological sensitivity to the effects of alcohol.""",0
"b'Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells, promoting IgE synthesis by B cells. The molecular basis for increased IL-4 gene expression in atopy is not fully understood. IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells. Recently, a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse. In a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts of highly polarized Th2 clones from atopics and Th1 clones from controls we compared DNA-binding activities at the two NFAT-binding elements P0 and P1 of the crucial proximal human IL-4 promoter. At the most proximal P0 site, NFAT-containing complexes devoid of NFAT2 were readily inducible in the Th1 clones, but hardly or not in the Th2 clones. In contrast, both in Th1 and Th2 clones NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the P1 site, consisting of NFAT2 and a P0-competable NFAT activity, without apparent differences between Th1 and Th2 clones. Like in Th2 clones, suppressed NFAT\x96P0 complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum IgE levels, but not in control PBMC. These findings suggest that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level.'",4
"b'The capacity to deliberately control attention in order to hold and manipulate information in working memory is critical to higher cognitive functions. This suggests that between-subject differences in general cognitive ability might be related to observable differences in the activity of brain systems that support working memory and attention control. To test this notion, electroencephalograms were recorded from 80 healthy young adults during spatial working memory tasks. Measures of task-related neurophysiological and behavioral variables were derived from these data and compared to scores on a test battery commonly used to assess general cognitive ability (the WAIS-R). Subjects who scored high on the psychometric test also tended to respond faster in the experimental tasks without any loss of accuracy. The amplitude of the late positive component of the event-related potential was larger in high-ability subjects, and the frontal midline theta component of the EEG signal was also selectively enhanced in this group under conditions of sustained performance and high working memory load. These results suggest that subjects who scored high on the WAIS-R were better able to focus and sustain attention to task performance. Changes in the EEG alpha rhythm in response to manipulations of task practice and load were also examined and compared between frontal and parietal regions. The results indicated that high-ability subjects developed strategies that made relatively greater use of parietal regions, whereas low-ability subjects relied more exclusively on frontal regions. Other analyses indicated that hemispheric asymmetries in alpha band measures distinguish between individuals with relatively high verbal aptitude and those with relatively high nonverbal aptitude. In particular, subjects with a verbal cognitive style tended to make greater use of the left parietal region during task performance, and subjects with a nonverbal style tended to make greater use of the right parietal region. These results help clarify relationships between task-related brain activity and individual differences in cognitive ability and style.'",1
"b'Recent research indicates that non-tonal novel events, deviating from an ongoing auditory environment, elicit a positive event-related potential (ERP), the novel P3. Although a variety of studies examined the neural network engaged in novelty detection, there is no complete picture of the underlying brain mechanisms. This experiment investigated these neural mechanisms by combining ERP and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses were measured in the same subjects using the same experimental design. The ERP analysis revealed a novel P3, while the fMRI responses showed bilateral foci in the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus. When subjects attended to the novel stimuli only identifiable novel sounds evoked a N4-like negativity. Subjects showing a strong N4-effect had additional fMRI activation in right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) as compared to subjects with a weak N4-effect. This pattern of results suggests that novelty processing not only includes the registration of deviancy but may also lead to a fast access and retrieval of related semantic concepts. The fMRI activation pattern suggests that the superior temporal gyrus is involved in novelty detection, whereas accessing and retrieving semantic concepts related to novel sounds additionally engages the rPFC.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Alcohol problems have increased considerably in Thailand in recent years, in common with many other countries in South East Asia. Little is known about the patterns or contexts of alcohol consumption in these countries, and so efforts to develop preventative strategies have been hampered. To identify current patterns related to alcohol consumption, we recruited 91 alcohol-dependent subjects, 77 hazardous or harmful drinkers, and 144 abstainers or light drinkers. A structured interview incorporating the World Health Organization \x91tri-level\x92 method to determine the amount and frequency of drinking, and the Alcohol Use Disorders and Associated Disabilities to diagnose alcohol dependence and harmful drinking was used. Median alcohol intake was 75 and 49 g/drinking day in the alcohol-dependent and harmful or hazardous groups respectively. The former group drank on average 25 days/month, whereas the harmful or hazardous drinkers drank 10 days/month. Drinking alone was more common in the alcohol-dependent group (67%), whereas harmful or hazardous drinkers typically drank with friends (58%), and infrequent drinkers drank only at social functions (61%). Only 28% of alcohol-dependent subjects perceived themselves as dependent on alcohol. The alcohol-dependent subjects and hazardous or harmful drinkers were more likely to currently smoke cigarettes and have a history of marijuana use than were non-drinkers, infrequent or light drinkers. Antisocial personality disorder was more commonly associated with alcohol dependence. In conclusion, alcohol dependence was characterized by continual drinking, whereas hazardous or harmful consumption was associated with an intermittent pattern. Other forms of substance use and personality disorder were associated with alcohol dependence. Clearer understanding of these factors would be of great benefit in planning an intervention programme for excessive drinking in Thailand.'",0
"b""Perhaps one useful response to the thesis advanced by Zielhuis and Kiemeney, summed up in the article's title, \x91Social epidemiology? No way\x92,1 can be provided by four evidence-based linked logical arguments.2\x9617 These are:\r\n\r\nArgument #1\r\n\r\nThesis 1: People are social beings who live in socially-constituted societies. \r\nThesis 2: People are biological organisms, Homo sapiens. \r\nDeduction: People live in the world simultaneously as social and biological beings. \r\nArgument #2\r\n\r\nThesis 1: Expression of biological traits depends on the conditions under which biological organisms live, including their interactions with other organisms. \r\nThesis 2: Disease, disability, death, and health are states of being involving expression of biological traits. \r\nDeduction: Disease, disability, death, and health are embodied expressions of conditions under which organisms live. \r\nArgument #3\r\n\r\nThesis 1: One component of explaining a phenomenon is HOW it occurs. \r\nThesis 2: One component of explaining a phenomenon is WHY it occurs. \r\nDeduction: Explanations of phenomena that address HOW and WHY they occur are more complete than explanations addressing only HOW they occur. \r\nArgument #4\r\n\r\nThesis 1: Epidemiology is the study of population distributions of disease, disability, death, and health and their determinants and deterrents, across time and space. \r\nThesis 2: Population patterns of disease, disability, and death reflect population distributions of exposure, susceptibility, and resistance to conditions comprising sufficient causes for (or deterrents to) the specified outcomes and occurring during the aetiologically relevant time interval. \r\nDeduction: Epidemiological explanations of current and changing patterns of disease, disability, and death must be compatible with temporally relevant and changing distributions of determinants of and deterrents to the specified outcomes. \r\nTaken together, these arguments imply that epidemiologically adequate explanations of current and changing distributions of population health entail simultaneous social and biological explanations.18\x9619 Thus, training in\x97and application of\x97social and biological theories and reasoning are important for epidemiologists, as is development of an historical perspective on changing epidemiological profiles across diverse societies.2,18\x9622 Also relevant is training in concepts and methods of quantitative population sciences, including but not limited to biostatistics.2,20,22\x9623 Training in or comprehension of solely biomedical sciences is insufficient. The study of biological phenomena is broader than \x91biomedicine\x92: other non-medical aspects of biological sciences are highly relevant, including constructs and content of evolutionary biology and ecology.5\x967\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the challenge of explaining excess hypertension among African Americans.24,25 Despite advances in population genetics, which emphasize the non-biological and social basis of \x91racial\x92 categories as well as the tremendous \x91mixing\x92 of African, European, and American Indian lineages (by both rape and consensual unions),26,27 biomedical literature remains rife with studies attempting to discern whether \x91race\x92\x97as an alleged biological trait\x97explains US black/white disparities in hypertension (not to mention other health outcomes).25,28,29 Hidden from view are other relevant and promising hypotheses, especially regarding the role of racial discrimination in the aetiology of hypertension and other conditions related to chronic exposure to threats to mental and somatic well-being.30\x9635 As the small but burgeoning literature on social inequalities in health reveals, ignoring social determinants of social disparities in health precludes adequate explanations for actual and changing population burdens of disease and death, thereby hampering efforts for prevention.13,36,37\r\n\r\nConsider, too, the phenomenon of parity in relation to risk of cancer. The focus of epidemiological research informed solely by biomedical assumptions is on links between parity and risk of cancer via pathways related to pregnancy-induced changes in diverse hormone levels.38,39 Add, however, the question of whether parity reflects social factors that are also determinants of risk of cancer, investigate links between parity and risk of cancer among men, and new knowledge emerges.38 Notably, parity is equally associated, among women and men, with risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer and malignant melanoma\x97for which the parity/risk association had been previously interpreted in other terms. One implication is not to presume parity exerts effects solely by pregnancy-related biological processes; the other is to consider the social meaning of parity even when the biology of pregnancy is relevant. Simplistic divisions of the social and biological will not suffice. Study adrenal glands only among cadavers of the poor, long since hypertrophied due to excess excretion of cortisol, and\x97as occurred in the early 20th century\x97the wealthy will be diagnosed with adrenal deficiency disorders.40\r\n\r\nIn summary, if Zielhuis and Kiemeney choose to conduct epidemiological work premised solely upon \x91biomedical theory\x92, and to castigate \x91social epidemiology\x92 for producing \x91trivial statements, useless for society\x92, that is their prerogative. It would, however, be interesting to know what texts Zielhuis and Kiemeney would recommend to aspiring epidemiologists for the study of \x91biomedical theory\x92. As any systematic search of library databases will show, none exist, at least by this name, even as medical textbooks abound. Instead, tenets of \x91biomedicine\x92 typically have been named and analysed by its critics who, while generally appreciating the knowledge gained by study of biological phenomena, nevertheless highlight the ignorance produced and knowledge forsaken by restricting inquiry to questions generated by individualistic frameworks which deliberately ignore social determinants of health, disease, and well-being.41\x9644 If logic and an open mind are prized features of scientific inquiry, the illogic and narrowness of Zielhuis and Kiemeney's argument are surely counterproductive to the further development of the enlightening and useful epidemiological research that we all desire.""",3
"b'Classes of intracellular lectins that recognize core-type structures and mediate intracellular glycoprotein trafficking are present in vertebrates, model invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, plants, and yeasts. Lectins that recognize more complex structures at the cell surface, such as C-type lectins and galectins, are also found in invertebrate organisms as well as vertebrates, but the functions of these proteins have evolved differently in different animal lineages.\r\nComplex oligosaccharide structures displayed at cell surfaces, incorporated into the extracellular matrix, and attached to secreted glycoproteins can serve structural roles, mediate movement of glycoconjugates to the cell surface, or act as markers that mediate cell\x96cell and cell-matrix recognition events. The nonstructural roles of sugars generally require the participation of sugar-binding lectins (Drickamer and Taylor, 1998Go). Lectins are often complex, multidomain proteins, but sugar-binding activity can usually be ascribed to a single protein module within the lectin polypeptide. Such a module is designated a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). CRDs in vertebrate lectins fall into a number of structurally distinct families of protein modules. Some of the best characterized of these CRD groups are summarized in Table I. The list is by no means complete, as sugar-binding activity has also been described for other protein modules that have folds not represented in this list. For example, several structurally distinct types of proteins have been shown to bind glycosaminoglycans. Although it has been proposed that these proteins might share a common local binding motif (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989Go), such a motif would have to be presented in the context of many different protein structures. For reasons of space, this survey of potential CRDs in model organisms discussed is restricted to the structural categories '",2
"b'Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I; McKusick 25280) results from a deficiency in {alpha}-L-iduronidase activity. Using a bioinformatics approach, we have previously predicted the putative acid/base catalyst and nucleophile residues in the active site of this human lysosomal glycosidase to be Glu182 and Glu299, respectively. To obtain experimental evidence supporting these predictions, wild-type {alpha}-L-iduronidase and site-directed mutants E182A and E299A were individually expressed in Chinese hamster ovary\x96K1 cell lines. We have compared the synthesis, processing, and catalytic properties of the two mutant proteins with wild-type human {alpha}-L-iduronidase. Both E182A and E299A transfected cells produced catalytically inactive human {alpha}-L-iduronidase protein at levels comparable to the wild-type control. The E182A protein was synthesized, processed, targeted to the lysosome, and secreted in a similar fashion to wild-type {alpha}-L-iduronidase. The E299A mutant protein was also synthesized and secreted similarly to the wild-type enzyme, but there were alterations in its rate of traffic and proteolytic processing. These data indicate that the enzymatic inactivity of the E182A and E299A mutants is not due to problems of synthesis/folding, but to the removal of key catalytic residues. In addition, we have identified a MPS I patient with an E182K mutant allele. The E182K mutant protein was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and also found to be enzymatically inactive. Together, these results support the predicted role of E182 and E299 in the catalytic mechanism of {alpha}-L-iduronidase and we propose that the mutation of either of these residues would contribute to a very severe clinical phenotype in a MPS I patient.'",2
"b'Ethanol exerts its behavioural effects largely by interacting with receptors for brain neurotransmitters. However, the molecular mechanisms involving these interactions and the pathogenesis of alcohol-withdrawal symptomatology are still not well understood. Until recently, no data were available about homocysteine (Hcy) levels in acute alcohol intoxication of chronic alcoholics and in patients undergoing withdrawal from alcohol. Hcy, blood-alcohol concentrations, vitamins B6, B12, and folate concentrations were assessed in 29 chronic alcoholics, who underwent withdrawal from alcohol. We observed increased Hcy levels in most patients. Hcy levels steadily decreased during the observation period. We postulate that hyperhomocysteinaemia and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, by their agonism at the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, may partly mediate alcohol-associated withdrawal symptomatology. The importance of assessing serum Hcy levels in order to detect methylation deficiency in patients with chronic alcoholism and for possible therapeutic strategies is discussed.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The size of the cerebral cortex is determined by the rate of production of neurons and glial cells in the proliferative ventricular and subventricular zones. Recent studies from targeted mutations of different death-effector gene families indicate that programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in cell production and early morphogenesis of the mammalian forebrain before the formation of neuronal connections. For example, disruption of the c-Jun N-kinase signaling pathway by double-targeted mutation of both Jnk1 and Jnk2 results in increased PCD in the forebrain leading to precocious degeneration of cerebral precursors. In contrast, disturbance of the caspase cascade by targeted disruption of either casp-9 or casp-3 leads to decreased PCD causing expansion and exencephaly of the forebrain as well as supernumerary neurons in the cerebral cortex. The supernumerary neurons in these knockout mice align radially and form an expanded cortical plate which begins to form cerebral convolutions. Thus, the precise coordination of different apoptotic signaling pathways during early stages of neurogenesis is crucial for regulation of the proper cortical size and shape.\r\n\r\n'",1

We now report the thymic generation of dual {alpha}\xdfTCR+ T cells in the H-2Db/H-Y-specific TCR transgenic (Tg) mouse. Dual TCR+ thymocytes were positively selected less efficiently than single TCR+ thymocytes, although a subset attained maturity. Importantly, when TCR Tg mice were bred onto a negatively selecting background, auto-specific cells survived central deletion and matured as CD4+ dual TCR+ cells. These cells were autoreactive when CD8 expression was restored. The existence of autospecific, dual TCR+ T cells may have implications for the maintenance of self tolerance.'",4
"b'Drawing on metaphors from linguistics and information theory, Atlan and Cohen challenge us to take a very different view of the immune system, one that engages in constant chatter among the constituents and allows the immune system to arrive at a decision about what to, and not to, destroy. Our commentary responds to this challenge and points out many logical biological flaws in their view. We seem to agree that specificity is important, and that there is some kind of somatic selection process at work to distinguish self from non-self. Our analysis of models depends on the basis of how self and non-self are separated. There are only two possibilities, time or space; and space-based models are all but ruled out. There are two major kinds of time-based model, one based on the time taken for an organism to develop from embryo to adult, the other based on the time taken for a cell to differentiate from one state to another. With so many ambiguities in the metaphors and so little attention to mechanism, the Atlan and Cohen challenge is, we suspect, based on time measured in cell differentiation units. They also make the common mistake of assuming repertoires that are transcendental in size (>1010), making it impossible to have a functional immune system in animals smaller than a rabbit\x97a feature that does not instil confidence in the biological relevance of such models.\r\n\r\n'",4
"b'Studies that have investigated the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on the level of oestrogens and progesterone in both pre- and post-menopausal women are reviewed. It is concluded that several lines of evidence point to an alcohol-induced rise in natural or synthetic oestrogen levels in women. Proposed mechanisms include an increased rate of aromatization of testosterone or a decreased rate of oxidation of oestradiol to oestrone. Moderate alcohol consumption has also been linked to decreased progesterone levels in pre-menopausal women. The relevance of these findings to female health, fertility and the timing of the menopause is considered.'",0
"b'Anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma are frequent and malignant brain tumors that are infiltrated by T lymphocytes. Whether these cells result from non-specific inflammation following blood\x96brain barrier disruption or an antigen-driven specific immune response is unknown. In this study, an in-depth characterization of TCR diversity in tumor and blood RNA biopsies was performed in a series of 16 patients with malignant astrocytoma. Whilst there was no obvious restriction of the AV and BV gene segment usage, complementarity-determining region 3 size analysis and sequencing of amplified TCR transcripts revealed multiple T cell oligoclonal expansions in all astrocytomas analyzed. Unique T cell clones were present in different adjacent areas of a given tumor, but never detected in the blood. Quantification of the number of TCR clonal transcripts per \xb5g of tumor RNA indicated that certain T cell clonal expansions may represent at least 300 cells/106 tumor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the in vivo expanded clones were almost exclusively confined to the CD8+ subset. Overall, these data suggest that spontaneous antigen-driven immune responses may be elicited against human astrocytoma despite the immunosuppressive microenvironment generated by the brain and the tumor itself. However, the ultimate failure of the immune system to control tumor growth could be the consequence of a deficient CD4 Th component of the response. This observation could have important consequences for the development of immunotherapies for astrocytoma patients.'",4
"b""Routine data from the Dutch Transition project on 236 027 episodes of care collected by 54 family physicians (FPs) for 93 297 patient years in their listed practices and classified with the International Classification of Primary Care, were used to analyse chronic alcohol abuse episodes of care in Dutch family practices. Data on 332 episodes are presented. In a subsample with a 4-year registration period, 70 patients were identified. Important reasons for an encounter are the patient's explicit presentation of the problem and the FPs' initiatives. FPs show considerable sensitivity to psychosocial problems, including alcohol abuse. It is concluded that over the years registered FPs actively deal with chronic alcohol abuse in approximately 2% of all visiting men aged 25\x9664 years. In an average Dutch family practice with 2200 listed patients, approximately 20 patients are known by the FP to have chronic alcohol abuse. Real life studies in registered family practice populations are necessary to better establish how patients with abundant alcohol consumption as a risk factor develop the chronic alcohol abuse episode of care, and what FPs can do to prevent this effectively.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most prominent sialic acid in eukaryotes. The structural diversity of sialic acid is exploited by viruses, bacteria, and toxins and by the sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids involved in cell\x96cell recognition in their highly specific recognition and binding to cellular receptors. The physiological precursor of all sialic acids is N-acetyl D-mannosamine (ManNAc). By recent findings it could be shown that synthetic N-acyl-modified D-mannosamines can be taken up by cells and efficiently metabolized to the respective N-acyl-modified neuraminic acids in vitro and in vivo. Successfully employed D-mannosamines with modified N-acyl side chains include N-propanoyl- (ManNProp), N-butanoyl- (ManNBut)-, N-pentanoyl- (ManNPent), N-hexanoyl- (ManNHex), N-crotonoyl- (ManNCrot), N-levulinoyl- (ManNLev), N-glycolyl- (ManNGc), and N-azidoacetyl D-mannosamine (ManNAc-azido). All of these compounds are metabolized by the promiscuous sialic acid biosynthetic pathway and are incorporated into cell surface sialoglycoconjugates replacing in a cell type\x96specific manner 10\x9685% of normal sialic acids. Application of these compounds to different biological systems has revealed important and unexpected functions of the N-acyl side chain of sialic acids, including its crucial role for the interaction of different viruses with their sialylated host cell receptors. Also, treatment with ManNProp, which contains only one additional methylene group compared to the physiological precursor ManNAc, induced proliferation of astrocytes, microglia, and peripheral T-lymphocytes. Unique, chemically reactive ketone and azido groups can be introduced biosynthetically into cell surface sialoglycans using N-acyl-modified sialic acid precursors, a process offering a variety of applications including the generation of artificial cellular receptors for viral gene delivery. This group of novel sialic acid precursors enabled studies on sialic acid modifications on the surface of living cells and has improved our understanding of carbohydrate receptors in their native environment. The biochemical engineering of the side chain of sialic acid offers new tools to study its biological relevance and to exploit it as a tag for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.'",2
"b""Sir\x97The relation of perinatal health to child health was addressed by Gissler et al.1 using unique data resources in Finland. The Medical Birth Register allowed them to study a cohort of over 60 000 births with virtually complete follow-up for most outcomes over a 7-year period. While they documented the expected increased mortality and long-term morbidity associated with being born early or small, they had an opportunity to examine effects of mild degrees of prematurity or small size but did not present the data to do so. Preterm birth, for example, is usually defined as birth prior to completion of 37 weeks' gestation, but in the obstetric community, births as early as 34 weeks are of little concern and births of 35 or 36 weeks are considered normal. Similarly, infants below 2500 g at birth are defined as low birthweight, but there is a widely held view that births as low as 2000 g are of little or no concern.\r\n\r\nThis perception is valid, in part at least, because modest degrees of prematurity or small size have limited adverse consequences for short-term survival, though there is still a measurable increase in mortality as late as 36 weeks' gestation (US National Center for Health Statistics, personal communication). The question of whether there are long-term, subtle adverse health effects associated with marginally early or small births is an important and unresolved public health question. Many intervention trials evaluate such endpoints as preterm birth but not severe preterm birth,2 and the large number of marginally preterm or low birthweight infants may result in sizeable impact on a population basis even if the increments in risk are modest. Therefore, the question of whether mild degrees of prematurity or reduced size are worthy of concern is critical, and the only way to address that issue is in studies of large populations of births with long-term follow-up of outcomes more sensitive than death alone.\r\n\r\nGissler et al.1 present data on gestational age grouped as 22\x9627, 28\x9636, and 37\x9644 weeks, but stratification within the 28\x9636 week group would be necessary to answer the question of what degree of prematurity incurs increased risk. Similarly, dividing the birthweight interval of 1500\x962499 g into two groups, 1500\x961999, 2000\x962499 would be informative. If there are truly no measurable adverse consequences to being born at the margins of prematurity or low birthweight, the standards should be revised. If there are adverse sequelae, even if delayed and subtle, clinicians would need to take those risks into account as they make decisions about delivering infants early for medical indications""",3
"b'CD44 is a family of mucin-like membrane proteins generated by alternative splicing of several exons, and participate in T cell adhesion and activation. CD44-mediated signaling involves activation of p56lck and leads to ZAP-70 phosphorylation. The aim of the present study was to identify the signaling pathways that follow CD44-triggered ZAP-70 phosphorylation and the molecular mechanisms underlying the CD44 interaction with p56lck. We found that CD44 cross-linking by mAb in CD4+ peripheral blood T cells promotes formation of a trimeric complex of Grb2, phospholipase (PLC)-{gamma}1 and a 36\x9638 kDa phosphoprotein, and the activation of PLC-{gamma}1. The amount of inositol triphosphate and the time kinetics of its generation were comparable to those following CD3 cross-linking. Co-capping, co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments showed that CD44 associates with CD4 and CD3 on the cell surface. This association suggests functional interplay between the CD4\x96TCR complex and CD44. In line with this possibility, we found that CD4 triggering by gp120, a natural ligand of CD4, potentiates CD44-mediated adhesion to hyaluronic acid. Moreover, Ca2+ mobilization induced by CD44 cross-linking by mAb was higher in a subclone of the HUT78 cell line expressing CD4 than in a non-expressing subclone.'",4
"b'Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of high titers of anti-\xdf2-glycoprotein I (\xdf2GPI) antibodies, lupus anticoagulant associated with thromboembolic phenomena, thrombocytopenia and recurrent fetal loss. Single-chain Fv (scFv) were prepared from four anti-\xdf2GPI mAb, CAM, CAL, CAR and 2C4C2, and one anti-ssDNA. All five scFv showed the same antigen binding properties as the original mAb. Replacement of the pathogenic CAM VH domain with the non-pathogenic CAL VH or anti-ssDNA VH decreased the binding affinity of the scFv to \xdf2GPI and completely abrogated the anticoagulant activity. Exchanging the CAM VH with anti-DNA VH resulted in a shift from anti-\xdf2GPI to anti-ssDNA binding of the scFv. Replacement of the CAM VL with CAL VL did not affect the binding and activity. BALB/c mice were immunized with the anti-\xdf2GPI scFv, and the scFv resulting from the substitution of the heavy (H) and light (L) chains. The mice which were immunized with CAM, 2C4C2 and CAR scFv developed clinical manifestations of experimental anti-phospholipid syndrome. Elevated titers of mouse anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-\xdf2GPI, associated with lupus anticoagulant activity, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and a high percentage of fetal resorptions were detected, in the CAM scFv group and in the scFv composed of CAM VH groups. High titers of aCL, anti-\xdf2GPI, anti-ss/dsDNA and anti-histone associated with lupus findings were observed in the sera of the 2C4C2 scFv-immunized mice. Immunization with CAL scFv did not lead to any clinical findings. The current study shows that scFv of pathogenic antibodies are capable of inducing the same clinical manifestations as the whole antibody molecule upon active immunization. Replacement of H/L chains point to the importance of the VH domains in the pathogenic potential of anti-\xdf2GPI.'",4
"b'The establishment of CD4+ T cell tolerance requires that self-reactive thymocytes are negatively selected during thymic development. A threshold of antigen concentration appears to exist for both MHC class I- and class II-mediated negative selection, below which clonal deletion of a self-reactive transgenic TCR does not occur. Similarly, both the specificity and thymic concentration of MHC molecules affect the efficiency with which autoreactive thymocytes are deleted. However, this threshold for MHC class II concentration has not been well established. Here, we show that this threshold must be extraordinarily low. We have used the human lysozyme promoter to re-express an A\xdfb cDNA on macrophages and other phagocytic myelomonocytic cells of class II-deficient A\xdfb \x96/\x96 mice. Surface expression of I-Ab could be detected on mature peritoneal macrophages and, minimally, on thymic dendritic cells; however, this level of expression was not sufficient for antigen-specific T cell activation. Nevertheless, when backcrossed onto an autoreactive K14 background, this minimal level of class II was sufficient to induce negative selection of a polyclonal self-reactive population. We conclude that provision of extremely low levels of class II to thymic dendritic cells confers on them the ability to mediate clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells.'",4
"b'Disease registers are used for two main purposes: to measure the incidence or prevalence of a disease, or to study its natural history. For example, the WHO MONICA collaboration was established in the early 1980s to register myocardial infarction and stroke in different populations worldwide, and thus allow comparisons of incidence to be made.1 Similarly, cancer registries are routinely used to provide data for comparisons of incidence of different cancers between areas of the UK. These purposes clearly require a different breadth of data than a register intended to study the natural history of a disease. For instance, a stroke register in South London, UK, was established not only to measure the incidence of stroke in this area, but also to follow stroke patients over time in order to examine factors affecting outcome and risk factor management.2 Quality criteria for stroke incidence registers have been defined, emphasizing the importance of complete, community-based case ascertainment.3\r\n\r\nIn either case, a register needs to provide an accurate, unbiased estimate of the number of cases of disease in the population. This should be done by estimating the number of cases missed by the register. In practice however, it is often assumed that if the register has been conducted \x91carefully\x92 then it will be 100% complete, or at least have missed so few cases that the implications of the study will be unaffected by incompleteness. For example, the MONICA study set out criteria (more than 10% of fatal cases not hospitalized, more than 5% of non-fatal cases not hospitalized, 28-day case fatality less than 40% and a ratio of fatal cases to stroke deaths from routine mortality statistics greater than 1) for assuming equal completeness of case ascertainment across different centres.4 However, an estimate of the completeness of the register was not made, and there was no evidence that the criteria were necessary or sufficient for completeness. Using the number of cases from a register to estimate incidence assumes that no cases are missing.5 In addition, if the cases missed differ from those observed (e.g. less severe cases are less likely to be registered) then using only the observed cases will lead to biased inferences.\r\n\r\nCapture-recapture methods have been advocated for use in estimating completeness of a register.6 These methods were originally developed to estimate the size of a closed animal population. The procedure is that at one time as many animals as possible in an area are captured, tagged and released\x97the \x91capture\x92 stage. At a later time this is repeated\x97the \x91recapture\x92 stage. The number of animals in each sample, and the number common to both, are used to estimate the number in the total population (assuming that capture and recapture are independent)'",3
"b'Thalamic nuclei adjacent to the medial geniculate body play a pivotal role in processing of sensory stimuli during emotional situations. These nuclei, which include the suprageniculate nucleus (SG), the posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN), the peripeduncular nucleus (PP) and the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGm), project to both cortex and amygdala, but target areas and the extent of the projection of individual nuclei are not known yet. The aim of the present study was to analyze the contribution of individual nuclei to the cortical projection with modern sensitive tracing techniques. Small injections of Miniruby or PHA-L were made into single thalamic nuclei. All thalamic nuclei have in common a projection into the upper portion of layer I of the temporal aspect of the cortical mantle. Furthermore, SG, PIN, MGm and PP each demonstrated a convergent projection to lower layer III and to layer IV of the ectorhinal and visceral cortex. Only MGm projects to layer VI of primary auditory and temporal association cortices. Within the perirhinal cortex zones of convergence and divergence exist. The present results demonstrate a differential thalamocortical projection of single thalamic nuclei to those cortical areas which are involved in the transmission of sensory signals to the amygdala via the thalamocortico-cortical pathway and to the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex. The thalamic nuclei are thus in a position to activate the amygdala and to modulate the information flow of the thalamocortico-cortical pathway to both amygdala and hippocampus.'",1
"b'The measurement of liver volume has gained practical use in relation to liver transplantation (Kawasaki et al., 1993Go). Liver volume may also relate to the many metabolic processes in which the liver is engaged (Homeida et al., 1979Go; Marchesini et al., 1988Go; Murry et al., 1995Go; Reichel et al., 1997Go; Kwo et al., 1998Go; Andersen et al., 1999Go). The present study was undertaken to measure liver volume by computerized tomography (CT) in patients and to investigate its potential correlation to height, age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), drinking, and smoking habits.\r\n\r\nPatients were eligible for the study if they were referred for an abdominal CT scan and fulfilled the following criteria: (1) normal CT scan of the liver without focal lesions; (2) attenuation comparable to the spleen; (3) no history or clinical signs of liver disease. Patients who had received chemotherapy during the 2 years prior to the study, or upper abdominal radiation therapy, were excluded, as were patients below the age of 18 years, pregnant women, and patients with disorders known to affect the liver. All gave informed consent. Daily tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were established by interview. Body height and weight were measured. BMI was calculated as body weight/height2. Twenty-three women entered the study. They were 57.4 (51.8\x9663.0) years of age; height 165 (163\x96167) cm, body weight 69.6 (64.4\x9674.8) kg, BMI 26.0 (24.2\x9627.8) kg/m2 [means (95% CI)]. Eight subjects smoked 3.3 (0\x967.2) g of tobacco/day and seven alcohol consumers drank 6 (0\x9614) g alcohol/day [means (95% CI)]. All except one were out-patients. Thirty-three men entered the study. They were 51.9 (34.2\x9669.6) years of age; height 178 (176\x96180) cm, body weight 80.1 (76.8\x9683.4) kg, BMI 25.3 (24.2\x9626.4) kg/m2. Sixteen subjects smoked 5.7 (2.9\x9614.3) g tobacco/day and 26 alcohol consumers drank 31 (26\x9636) g alcohol/day. Only two men were not out-patients. The CT examinations and calculation of liver volume were performed as described earlier (Andersen et al., 1999Go). Multiple forward regression analysis using the liver size as dependent value was performed. The alcohol consumed was log 10 transformed before analysis and the analysis of tobacco consumption was done for smokers and non-smokers, respectively. The remaining parameters were distributed normally. Significance level (P) was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was done using the computer program manual Statistica for Windows (1996) (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).\r\n\r\nLiver volume was 1398 (1294\x961502) ml [mean (95% CI)] in female and 1831 (1796\x961956) ml in male patients. The liver volume (LV) correlated to body weight (BW) in females LV (ml) = 389 + 14.5 x BW (kg) (P < 0.01) and to body weight and alcohol consumption (AC) in males LV (ml) = 415 + 17.3 x BW (kg) + 210.5 x log10AC (drinks/day) (P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation to height, age or smoking habits (P > 0.05). The liver volume corrected for body weight (LV/BW) was 20.2 (19.1\x9621.3) ml/kg in females and 22.9 (21.5\x9624.3) ml/kg in males (P < 0.01). Men and women not consuming alcohol had LV of 1602 (1350\x961854) ml and 1341 (1233\x961449) ml, respectively.\r\n\r\nTable 1Go gives the data from the present study together with previously published data on liver volume and liver volume related to body weight. A considerable variation in liver volume is seen. This is mainly due to differences in body weight. Indeed, correcting the liver volume according to the body weight gives comparable values (Table 1Go). We found higher liver volumes in men than in women. However, we found no differences in liver volume corrected for body weight between women and men who did not consume alcohol. Thus, the higher liver volume found in men in our study was presumably due to higher body weight and alcohol consumption among men. This is in accordance with an investigation by ultrasound scanning, which showed no differences in LV/BW between men and women (Rasmussen, 1977Go). This was, however, in contrast with data from a recent study (Kwo et al., 1998Go). We found a significant relation between alcohol consumption and liver volume in male patients. The same relation was not found in females, probably due to the small number of drinkers and their modest alcohol consumption. Another study addressing this question (Barrison et al., 1987Go) found clinical hepatomegaly among \x91drink-watchers\x92, who had been heavy drinkers for at least 2 years. No significant correlation between liver volume and age, height or tobacco smoking was found in this study.'",0
"b'ucleotide sequences were determined for {alpha}1,3 galactosyltransferases ({alpha}1,3 GalTs) from several species (bat, mink, dog, sheep, and dolphin) and compared with those previously determined for this enzyme and members of the {alpha}1,3 galactosyl/N-acetylgalactosyltransferase ({alpha}1,3 Gal(NAc)Ts) family of enzymes. Sequence comparison of the newly characterized {alpha}1,3 GalT nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences with those previously characterized for other {alpha}1,3GalT enzymes demonstrated a remarkable level of sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The identity of each sequence as an {alpha}1,3 GalT was confirmed by expressing the encoded protein and characterizing the resulting enzyme.\r\n\r\nThe {alpha}1,3 GalTs have a significant degree of sequence homology with A and B transferases, the {alpha}1,3 GalNAcT that catalyzes the synthesis of Forssman antigen, and the recently cloned iso-globotriaosylceramide synthase. Among the conserved residues, there are two Cys residues. To determine if these conserved residues are free or involved in the formation of a disulfide bond, bovine {alpha}1,3 GalT was characterized by chemical modification and mass spectrometry. Each peptide containing a Cys residue was chemically labeled with an alkylating reagent demonstrating that these enzymes do not contain disulfide bonds. Similar results have recently been reported for A and B transferases (Yen et al., 2000Go, J. Mass. Spectrom., 35, 990\x961002). Thus, the highly conserved Cys residues found in these members of the {alpha}1,3 Gal(NAc)Ts family of enzymes are likely involved in other important aspects of enzyme structure/function within this enzyme family.'",2
"b'Heparanases are endoglycosidases that cleave the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans from proteoglycan core proteins and degrade them to small oligosaccharides. Inside cells, these enzymes are important for the normal catabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), generating glycosaminoglycan fragments that are then transported to lysosomes and completely degraded. When secreted, heparanases are thought to degrade basement membrane HSPGs at sites of injury or inflammation, allowing extravasion of immune cells into nonvascular spaces and releasing factors that regulate cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Heparanases have been described in a wide variety of tissues and cells, but because of difficulties in developing simple assays to follow activity, very little has been known about enzyme diversity until recently. Within the last 10 years, heparanases have been purified from platelets, placenta, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Characterization of the enzymes suggests there may be a family of heparanase proteins with different substrate specificities and potential functions.'",2
"b'In addition to a topographic map of the retina, mammalian visual cortex contains superimposed, orderly periodic maps of features such as orientation, eye dominance, direction of motion and spatial frequency. There is evidence that these maps are overlaid so as to ensure that all combinations of the different parameters are represented as uniformly as possible across visual space. However, it is unknown to what extent geometrical factors limit the number of periodic maps which might simultaneously be present, given this constraint. This paper attempts to investigate the question by using a dimension reduction model to generate maps of simple, many- dimensional feature spaces onto a model two-dimensional cortex. The feature space included a model retina, plus N binary variables, corresponding to parameters such as ocular dominance or spatial frequency. The results suggest that geometrical factors do not sharply limit the ability of the cortex to represent combinations of parameters in spatially superimposed maps of similar periodicity. Considerations of uniform coverage suggest an upper limit of six or seven maps. A higher limit, of about nine or ten, may be imposed by the numbers of neurons (or minicolumns) available to represent each of 2N features within a given small region of cortex.'",1
"b""The intronic IgH enhancer E\xb5, which consists of the core enhancer (cE\xb5) flanked by 5' and 3' matrix attachment regions (MAR), has been implicated in the control of IgH locus recombination and transcription. Both cE\xb5 and the MAR are required to enhance transcription of an IgH transgene. To elucidate the regulatory functions of cE\xb5 versus its associated MAR in IgH class switch recombination (CSR), we have assayed ES cell lines which have targeted deletions of these elements, both individually and in combination, by the Rag-2-deficient blastocyst complementation method. Mutant B cells from chimeric mice were activated in culture and the influence of the mutations on CSR was assessed by analysis of B cell hybridomas. We find that the cE\xb5 is necessary and sufficient for providing the functions of E\xb5 required for efficient CSR at the IgH locus. However, the 5' and 3' MAR sequences, as well as the known I\xb5 transcription start sites and the bulk of I\xb5 coding sequences, were dispensable for the process.""",4
"b'Background The cardiovascular risk factor levels of the population have been assessed in Finland since 1972. In the beginning the surveys were done to evaluate the North Karelia Project, which was a community-based preventive programme. A national cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention strategy was developed and implemented during the late 1970s. Subsequently, a national cardiovascular risk factors monitoring system was developed to assess the effectiveness of the national strategy.\r\n\r\nMethods Cross-sectional population samples were studied in 1972 and 1977 in North Karelia and Kuopio provinces in eastern Finland. An area in southwestern Finland was included in 1982, followed by the Helsinki metropolitan area in 1992 and Oulu province in northern Finland in 1997. A total of 19 761 men and 20 761 women aged 30\x9659 participated in the six surveys (1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997).\r\n\r\nResults The serum cholesterol levels of both genders have continuously declined. Systolic blood pressure levels have declined since 1972, but no further decline in diastolic blood pressure was found in 1997. Smoking prevalence among men continued to decline mainly due to an increase in the percentage of never-smokers. For the first time the increase in smoking prevalence among women levelled off and started to decline, mainly because the number of female quitters had increased.\r\n\r\nConclusions These data suggest that the cardiovascular health programme in Finland has succeeded in decreasing the general risk factor level of the population.'",3
"b'Ly49 receptors are inhibitory receptors expressed on subsets of both NK cells and NK1.1+ T cells. The function of these receptors on NK cells is believed to be important in maintaining self-tolerance, yet their role on T cells is unclear. In this report we investigated how an Ly49A transgene alters T and NK cell development in an in vivo environment, where a ligand for Ly49A is expressed. Ly49A transgenic mice that co-expressed an MHC ligand for Ly49A, H-2Dd, developed a severe inflammatory disorder that resulted in death within the first weeks of age. T cells expressing forbidden TCR V\xdf chains were found both in the thymus and periphery of transgenic mice, while non-transgenic littermates had successfully deleted these T cell subsets. These data indicate that the expression of Ly49A on T cells could alter T cell selection and allow survival of potentially self-reactive T cells.'",4
"b'Transgenic lpr/lpr mice expressing functional Fas selectively on B cells were produced in an attempt to elucidate the role of Fas on B cells in the regulation of autoantibody production. The homozygous lpr/lpr mice carrying the transgene did not produce anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies throughout their lives, whereas the development of abnormal lpr T cells (double negative, B220+) was not suppressed. Further analyses, however, revealed that the expression of the transgenic Fas on B cells of lpr/lpr homozygous mice resulted in severe impairment of the B cell function. The defect was characterized by a decrease in the number of mature peripheral B cells, a reduction in the serum Ig level and the total failure of B cells to mount antibody responses to stimulations of T-dependent as well as T-independent antigens. Such a defect was prominent only when the transgene was expressed on the lpr/lpr homozygous background. On the contrary, B cells of the transgenic lpr/lpr mice were shown to be capable of producing Ig when stimulated with anti-CD40 in the presence of IL-4 and IL-5. Furthermore, lpr/lpr T cells showed enhanced non-specific cytolytic activity. These observations suggested that the observed B cell defect was probably attributable to the destruction of activated B cells expressing transgenic Fas by aggressive lpr/lpr T cells.'",4
"b""espite decades of research, the role of free radicals in alcohol-induced organ injury is still a matter of debate. The present work was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of melatonin, a reported radical scavenger and antioxidant, on free radical toxicity induced by chronic ethanol administration. The major end-point of oxidative damage measured in this report was lipid peroxidation. Four groups of male Sprague\x96Dawley rats were used. The first group served as untreated controls and received a daily injection of alcoholic (<1% ethanol) saline. The second group of rats received daily at 18:00 a single subcutaneous injection of melatonin (10 mg/kg). Group 3 rats received only ethanol (3 g/kg) for 30 consecutive days; the ethanol was given at 18:30. The final group of rats was given both melatonin and ethanol with melatonin preceding ethanol by 30 min. Products of lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HDA)] were measured in the brain, heart, liver, lung and testes. At the conclusion of the study, MDA + 4-HDA levels were significantly increased in brains, hearts, lungs and testes, but not livers, of alcohol-treated compared with control rats. The percentage increases in lipid peroxidation products were 21.8%, 28.8%, 35.9% and 45.3% for brain, heart, lung and testes, respectively. In animals given melatonin 30 min before ethanol, the increases in MDA + 4-HDA levels were significantly reduced in all organs investigated, with levels not different from those in control rats. Based on these findings, it is speculated that melatonin's direct and indirect antioxidative actions inhibited alcohol-induced lipid peroxidation. These results suggest a new strategy for the treatment of alcohol-related diseases using melatonin as an antioxidant to reduce the damage inflicted by aggressive radical species.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'The sulci and gyri found within the anterior cingulate (AC), and across the cerebrum generally, have been found to vary in location and complexity from one individual to the next, making it difficult to analyze imaging data accurately and systematically. In this study, we examined the nature of morphometric variance in the AC of the left and right cerebral hemispheres using high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired from 176 healthy volunteers. Depending on the presence of a paracingulate sulcus (PCS) and its antero-posterior extent, three types of AC patterns were identified: \x91prominent\x92, \x91present\x92 and \x91absent\x92. Hemispheric comparisons across the whole sample showed the PCS to be more commonly \x91prominent\x92 in the left hemisphere and more commonly \x91absent\x92 in the right hemisphere. There was a significant gender difference, such that males showed an asymmetric pattern characterized by increased fissurization of the left AC, while females showed greater symmetry, with less fissurization of the left AC. Overall cerebral morphology, namely hemispheric volume and hemispheric fissurization, were also measured and used as independent variables as well as covariates in the analyses in order to ascertain the specificity of the results regarding AC morphology. Results showed that cerebral volume for males was larger on the right than on the left while fissurization showed the reverse asymmetry of greater leftward fissurization. In contrast, females were symmetric in both respects. The findings regarding AC morphology could not be explained by differences in these overall cerebral measures or by differences in age and handedness within the population. The results suggest that in the normal male brain, there exist morphological asymmetries at both the global and local levels that are less apparent in the female brain. The findings have implications for future studies examining the organization, development and functional anatomy of the AC.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The inner core structures of the lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of Neisseria meningitidis are potential vaccine candidates because both bactericidal and opsonic antibodies can be generated against these epitopes. In an effort to better understand LOS biosynthesis and the potential immunogenicity of the LOS inner core, we have determined the LOS structure from a meningococcal rfaK mutant CMK1. The rfaK gene encodes the transferase that adds an {alpha}-N-acetylglucosaminosyl residue to O-2 of the inner core heptose (Hep) II of the LOS. The LOS oligosaccharide from this mutant was previously shown to contain only Hep, 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo), and multiple phosphoethanolamine (PEA) substituents (Kahler et al., 1996aGo, J. Bacteriol., 178, 1265\x961273). The complete structure of the oligosaccharide (OS) component of the LOS from mutant CMK1 was determined using glycosyl composition and linkage analyses, and 1H, 13C, and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The CMK1 OS structure contains a PEA group at O-3 of Hep II in place of the usual glucosyl residue found at this position in the completed L2 LOS glycoform from the parent NMB strain. The PEA group at O-6 of Hep II, however, is present in both the CMK1 mutant LOS and parental NMB L2 LOS structures. The structure of the OS from CMK1 suggests that PEA substituents are transferred to both the O-3 and O-6 positions of Hep II prior to: (1) the incorporation of the {alpha}-GlcNAc on Hep II; (2) the synthesis of the {alpha}-chain on Hep I; and (3) the substitution of the glycosyl residue at the O-3 Hep II, which distinguishes L2 and L3 immunotypes. The LOS structure of the CMK1 mutant makes it a candidate immunogen that could generate broadly cross-reactive inner-core LOS antibodies.'",2
"b'Two different types of peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) were identified in developing embryos of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Because the optimum pH values for their activities were acidic and neutral, they were designated as acid PNGase M and neutral PNGase M, respectively. The acid PNGase M corresponded to the enzyme that had been partially purified from medaka embryos (Seko,A., Kitajima,K., Inoue,Y. and Inoue,S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem., 266, 22110-22114). The apparent molecular weight of this enzyme was 150 K, and the optimal pH was 3.5-4.0, and the Km for L-hyosophorin was 44 \xb5M. L-Hyosophorin is a cortical alveolus-derived glycononapeptide with a large N-linked glycan chain present in the perivitelline space of the developing embryo. Acid PNGase M was competitively inhibited by a free de-N-glycosylated nonapeptide derived from L-hyosophorin. This enzyme was expressed in ovaries and embryos at all developmental stages after gastrulation, but activity was not detected in embryos at developmental stages between fertilization and gastrula. Several independent lines of evidence suggested that acid PNGase M may be responsible for the unusual accumulation of free N-glycans derived from yolk glycoproteins (Iwasaki,M., Seko,A., Kitajima,K., Inoue,Y. and Inoue,S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem., 267, 24287-24296). In contrast, the neutral PNGase M was expressed in blastoderms from the 4-8 cell stage and in cells up to early gastrula. The general significance of these findings is that they show a developmental stage-dependent expression of the two PNGase activities, and that expression of the neutral PNGase M activity occurs concomitantly with the de-N-glycosylation of L-hyosophorin. These data thus support our conclusion that the neutral PNGase M is responsible for the developmental-stage-related de-N-glycosylation of theL-hyosophorin.'",2
"b'As a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, tenascin-R is located exclusively in the CNS. It is believed to play a role in myelination and axonal stabilization and, through repulsive properties, may contribute to the lack of regeneration of CNS axons following damage. The contrary functions of the tenascins have been localized to the different structural domains of the protein. However, little is known concerning the influence of the carbohydrate conjugated to the many potential sites for N- and O-glycosylation (10-20% by weight). As a first analytical requirement, we show that >80% of the N-glycans in tenascin-R are neutral and dominated by complex biantennary structures. These display the ""brain-type"" characteristics of outer-arm- and core-fucosylation, a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine and, significantly, an abundance of antennae truncation. In some structures, truncation resulted in only a single mannose residue remaining on the 3-arm, a particularly unusual consequence of the N-glycan processing pathway. In contrast to brain tissue, hybrid and oligomannosidic N-glycans were either absent or in low abundance. A high relative abundance of O-linked sialylated glycans was found. This was associated with a significant potential for O-linked glycosylation sites and multivalent display of the sialic acid residues. TheseO-glycans were dominated by the disialylated structure, NeuAc[alpha]2-3Gal[beta]1-3(NeuAc[alpha]2-6)GalNAc. The possibility that these O-glycans enable tenascin-R to interact in the CNS either with the myelin associated glycoprotein or with sialoadhesin on activated microglia is discussed.'",2
"b'Background A case-control study was conducted in Honduras to identify co-factors in the carcinogenic pathway by which human papillomavirus (HPV) causes invasive cervical cancer.\r\n\r\nMethods Ninety-nine cases aged 23\x9665 (median 47) years participated. Two controls were matched to each case by age and clinic where they first presented for cytological screening; controls had no cervical abnormalities. Information on risk factors was obtained by personal interviews in the clinics regarding sociodemographic, reproductive and behavourial characteristics. Human papillomavirus was detected in cervical scrapes by general primer-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis to identify the different types present.\r\n\r\nResults All cases had squamous cell tumours and most were FIGO (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians) class II or higher; HPV was strongly associated with cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 7.66, 95% CI : 3.88\x9615.1). Among HPV-positive women, dose-response relationships were observed for education, age at first intercourse and exposure to wood smoke that persisted after adjustment for previous screening. Among HPV-negative women, the number of sexual partners and parity were associated with cervical cancer. The protective effect of previous cytological screening operated independently of HPV.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our findings speak for the powerful role that both primary and secondary education plays in fostering a lifestyle that reduces the risk of invasive cervical cancer. The data suggest that important elements of such a lifestyle include later age at first sexual intercourse, a limited number of pregnancies, greater likelihood of undergoing cytological screening and reduced exposure to carcinogens in the household environment.'",3
"b'Background Early outbreak detection is necessary for control of meningococcal meningitis epidemics. A weekly incidence of 15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants averaged over 2 consecutive weeks is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for detection of meningitis epidemics in Africa. This and other thresholds are tested for ability to predict outbreaks and timeliness for control measures.\r\n\r\nMethods Meningitis cases recorded for 1990\x961997 in health centres of northern Togo were reviewed. Weekly and annual incidences were determined for each district. Ability of different weekly incidence thresholds to detect outbreaks was assessed according to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The number of cases potentially prevented by reactive vaccination in 1997 was calculated for each threshold.\r\n\r\nResults Outbreaks occurred in 1995\x961996 and in 1996\x961997. The WHO-recommended threshold had good specificity but low sensitivity. Thresholds of 10 and 7 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in one week had sensitivity and specificity of 100% and increased the time available for intervention by more than one or two weeks, respectively. A maximum of 65% of cases could have been prevented during the 1997 epidemic, with up to 8% fewer cases prevented for each week of delay in achieving vaccine coverage.\r\n\r\nConclusions In northern Togo, thresholds of 7 or 10 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per week were excellent predictors of meningitis epidemics and allowed more time for a reactive vaccination strategy than current recommendations.'",3
"b""Cerebroside (monohexosylceramide) components were identified in neutral lipids extracted from both the yeast and mycelial forms of the thermally dimorphic mycopathogen Histoplasma capsulatum. The components were purified from both forms and their structures elucidated by 1- and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and low energy tandem collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/CID-MS). Both components were characterized as \xdf-glucopyranosylceramides (GlcCers) containing (4E,8E)-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine as the long-chain base, attached to 18-carbon 2-hydroxy fatty N-acyl components. However, while the fatty acid of the yeast form GlcCer was virtually all N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoate, the mycelium form GlcCer was characterized by almost exclusive expression of N-2'-hydroxy-(E)-{Delta}3-octadecenoate. These results suggest that the yeast\x97mycelium transition is accompanied by up-regulation of an as yet uncharacterized ceramide or cerebroside 2-hydroxy fatty N-acyl (E)-{Delta}3-desaturase activity. They also constitute further evidence for the existence of two distinct pathways for ceramide biosynthesis in fungi, since glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), the other major class of fungal glycosphingolipids, are found with ceramides consisting of 4-hydroxysphinganine (phytosphingosine) and longer chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids. In addition to identification of the major glucocerebroside components, minor components (<5%) detectable by molecular weight differences in the ESI-MS profiles were also characterized by tandem ESI-MS/CID-MS analysis. These minor components were identified as variants differing in fatty acyl chain length, or the absence of the sphingoid 9-methyl group or (E)-{Delta}8-unsaturation, and are hypothesized to be either biosynthetic intermediates or the result of imperfect chemical transformation by the enzymes responsible for these features. Possible implications of these findings with respect to chemotaxonomy, compartmentalization of fungal glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathways, and regulation of morphological transitions in H.capsulatum and other dimorphic fungi are discussed.""",2
"b'\xdf-Catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene Armadillo and plays roles in both cell\x96cell adhesion and transduction of the Wnt signaling cascade. Recently, members of the Lef/Tcf transcription factor family have been identified as protein partners of \xdf-catenin, explaining how \xdf-catenin alters gene expression. Here we report that in T cells, Tcf-1 also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with \xdf-catenin, suggesting that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is operational in T lymphocytes as well. However, although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3\xdf (GSK-3\xdf), resulting in increased levels of \xdf-catenin, we find no evidence for involvement of GSK-3\xdf in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells. That is, a dominant negative GSK-3\xdf does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli (lithium or phytohemagglutinin) that inhibit GSK-3\xdf activity also do not activate Tcf reporter genes. Thus, inhibition of GSK-3\xdf is insufficient to activate Tcf-dependent transcription in T lymphocytes. In contrast, in C57MG fibroblast cells, lithium inactivates GSK-3\xdf and induces Tcf-controlled transcription. This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter gene expression of Tcf-responsive genes, and points to a difference in regulation of Wnt signaling between fibroblasts and lymphocytes.'",4
"b'Background Cervical malignancies are the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality among women in developing countries. Although early detection programmes using cytological methods, followed by aggressive treatment of precursor lesions are accepted as the main disease control strategy, fiscal limitations make this strategy unfeasible in many countries.\r\n\r\nMethods To screen selectively, we developed two risk scores using data from a population-based case-control study in Jamaica with 202 cases and 363 controls. Independent risk factors for cervical neoplasia were determined using logistic regression. An unweighted risk score for each subject was developed by a simple count of risk factors present and a weighted risk score was calculated by summing regression coefficients for each risk factor.\r\n\r\nResults Four patient characteristics were independently predictive of cervical neoplasia, older age (OR = 3.4, 95% CI : 1.8\x966.7), >=4 pregnancies (OR = 5.6, 95% CI : 1.2\x96 18.7), poverty (OR = 2.1, 95% CI : 1.3\x963.3) and cigarette smoking (OR = 1.9, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.2). Using cut-off points of >=20 for the weighted scores and >3 for unweighted scores, the sensitivity and specificity were 65% and 69% for the unweighted score and 75% and 61%, respectively, for the weighted score. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the weighted versus the unweighted scores were similar, suggesting similar overall accuracy.\r\n\r\nConclusion Selective screening using risk assessment strategies is potentially useful, particularly in resource-poor settings. However, whether weighting factors is essential is dependent on prevalence of factors in a given setting. Although this approach needs validation in other populations, women at highest risk for cervical neoplasia can be identified using demographic factors available during a regular clinic visit.'",3
"b""Background For the first time, models using multilevel analysis of Indian data and related simulation results are reported. They take hierarchical structure into account and incorporate variables from all levels to get correct analysis and proper interpretation of data on current contraceptive use (including sterilization and modern methods).\r\n\r\nMethods The data from an Indian State, Uttar Pradesh (UP), collected by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted during 10 October 1992 to 22 February 1993 was used. For model I, 7851 currently married women who were neither pregnant nor had continuing post-partum amenorrhoea (PPA) were considered. For model II, these women with at least one child (n = 6748) were used. Two-level logistic regression analysis was carried out for which women's level (level 1) and PSU (Primary Sampling Unit) level (level 2) variables were considered. The results were considered significant at the 5% level of significance. Simulation analysis using each model was also carried out.\r\n\r\nResults Model I reveals that those more likely to adopt contraception were women exposed to a TV message (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3; 95% CI : 1.1\x961.6); whose houses were pucca (bricks and mortar) (OR = 1.3; 95% CI : 1.1\x961.5); who were educated to high school level and above (OR = 2.9; 95% CI : 2.2\x963.7); whose husbands were literate with schooling of >=11 years (OR = 1.7; 95% CI : 1.4\x962.1); and who had >=2 living sons (OR = 2.2; 95% CI : 1.1\x964.4). Muslim and other religious women were less likely than Hindu women to adopt contraception (OR = 0.5; 95% CI : 0.4\x960.6). Also, the PSU level availability of all weather road was positively associated with contraceptive adoption (OR = 1.4; 95% CI : 1.1\x961.7). The PSU level variance, which is the unexplained PSU level variation after controlling for the considered characteristics, was significantly higher. The simulation results revealed that public health education (a TV message) was found to be more effective among less educated women. The PSU level availability of all weather road was as effective as public health education. Similar results were evident from the analysis of second data set (model II) with the noticeable finding that those whose last child is surviving are most likely to adopt contraception (OR = 8.82; 95% CI : 1.01\x9677.38).\r\n\r\nConclusions These results reveal that the survival status of the last child has a marked effect on the adoption of contraception in UP. They further support the idea that public health education (a TV message) is more effective among less educated women. Also, the PSU level presence of all weather road is equally effective. Consideration of higher level variables provides not only more accurate results but also important public health clues to help the policy planners.""",3
"b""A highly sensitive method to identify and quantify heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharides by using nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS) is described. The new approach allows us to detect approximately 50 nM of a chemically synthesized pentasaccharide with a structure of GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6SOMe (3-OH pentasaccharide). Typically, solutions were infused for a total of 5 min, at an average flow rate of 30 nl/min, and the remaining sample was recovered from the nanovial. The spectra shown were obtained by summing scans for 1\x963 min. Hence, our data indicated that as little as 3 x 10\x9615 mole of the pentasaccharide was consumed to obtain a reasonable spectrum at the concentration as low as 50 nM. In addition, we found a linear relationship between the relative response of the molecular ion and the concentration of the analyzed 3-OH pentasaccharide, demonstrating that this approach can be used to determine the amount of HS oligosaccharides. To this end, a 3-O-sulfated pentasaccharide was prepared by incubating the 3-OH pentasaccharide with purified HS 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phospho[35S]sulfate. The resulting 3-O-sulfated pentasaccharide was purified and analyzed by nESI-MS. Based on the standard curve constructed with the 3-OH pentasaccharide, we calculated the concentration of the 3-O-sulfated pentasaccharide by the relative response. The result indicates that this value is very close to the value measured by [35S]sulfate radioactivity. In conclusion, nESI-MS provides both high sensitivity and the capacity to quantify HSs. This approach is likely to become a very important tool for structural analysis and sequencing of HS and heparin oligosaccharides.""",2
"b'The different patchy organizations of neurons projecting from primary visual cortex (area 17) to the various extrastriate areas may contribute to functional differences in the output to each of these areas. The pattern of neurons projecting to extrastriate area 21a was examined using large injections of retrograde tracers and compared to the pattern shown by neurons projecting to the lateral suprasylvian area (LS). Patches of neurons projecting to 21a showed a bimodal laminar distribution, with numerous labeled cells in the upper and lower third of layer 3 bracketing a sparsely labeled central third; LS-projecting neurons were confined to the lower and middle thirds of layer 3. The 21a projecting cells were relatively tighter in their clustering pattern than the LS projecting cells, i.e. the difference in labeling density between patch and interpatch zones was greater for 21a-projecting cells than for LS-projecting cells. As previously shown for the LS-projecting cells, patches of 21a-projecting cells colocalized with CO blob columns in area 17. Combined with our earlier results, this study shows that the CO blob compartments in area 17 give rise to at least two distinct efferent pathways, one projecting to LS and the other to 21a, and furthermore suggest that each pathway may carry unique information to its extrastriate target.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Background Analyses of time trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality have generally revealed cohort-based changes in the rates. These have been linked to cohort-based changes in lifestyle factors. The effect of the changes in the reproductive risk factors on the changes in the rates, and the relative importance of the reproductive characteristics in Slovenia, a country which has not had much breast cancer screening, are investigated.\r\n\r\nMethods Data on breast cancer incidence for 1971\x961993 were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Slovenia (Registry). The Registry covers the whole population of the Republic of Slovenia (1.99 million on 30 June 1993). The statistical analysis uses parametric age-period-cohort models.\r\n\r\nResults Breast cancer incidence has increased by 70% in Slovenia from 1971 to 1993, These changes are dominated by cohort effects and the cohorts born in 1907\x961922 have the greatest increase in incidence. Period effects on changes in incidence were modest. The percentage of nulliparous women in the cohort and the average family size in the cohort explained 38% of the variation in the cohort effects.\r\n\r\nConclusions The percentage of nulliparous women in the cohort is the most important reproductive variable associated with the trends in the rates, with breast cancer risk predicted to be higher in cohorts with a larger percentage of nulliparous women. As the cohorts born 1932\x961946 have a more favourable reproductive pattern as regards breast cancer risk, compared to the 1907\x961922 cohorts, age-specific incidence rates in Slovenia would be predicted to decline in the future in the absence of changes in the other risk factors.'",3
"b'Objective To investigate the association between alcohol consumption and HIV sero-positivity in a rural Ugandan population.\r\n\r\nMethods The adult population residing in a cluster of 15 neighbouring villages has been kept under epidemiological surveillance for HIV infection using annual censuses and sero-surveys since 1989. At the eighth annual survey all respondents were asked about their history of alcohol consumption, the sale of alcohol in their household, and other socio-demographic information. After informed consent, blood was drawn for HIV serology.\r\n\r\nResults Of the total adult population 3279 (60%) were interviewed; 48% were males; 905 (27%) had not started sexual activity and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 2374, 8% were HIV infected, 57% had ever drunk alcohol, and 4% lived in households where alcohol was sold. Living in a household where alcohol was sold was associated with a history of having ever drunk alcohol (OR 2.9, 95% CI : 1.7\x964.8). HIV prevalence among adults living in households selling alcohol was 15% compared with 8% among those living in households not selling alcohol (OR 2.0, 95% CI : 1.1\x963.6). Individuals who had ever drunk alcohol experienced an HIV prevalence twice that of those who had never drunk, 10% versus 5% (OR 2.0, 95% CI : 1.5\x962.8). This association remained after adjusting for potential confounders including sale of alcohol in the household and Muslim religion (OR 1.8, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.7). Only age, marital status and having ever drunk alcohol independently predicted HIV sero-positivity in a logistic regression model.\r\n\r\nConclusions We have demonstrated an association between a history of alcohol consumption and being HIV sero-positive. This unexplored factor may explain in part the observed lower prevalence of HIV infection among Muslims. Public health campaigns need to stress the relationship between HIV and alcohol.'",3
"b'2-Keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) is a sialic acid (Sia) that is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates during normal development and tumorigenesis. Its expression is thought to be regulated by multiple biosynthetic steps catalyzed by several enzymes, including CMP-Sia synthetase. Using crude enzyme preparations, it was shown that mammalian CMP-Sia synthetases had very low activity to synthesize CMP-KDN from KDN and CTP, and the corresponding enzyme from rainbow trout testis had high activity to synthesize both CMP-KDN and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (Terada et al. [1993] J. Biol. Chem., 268, 2640\x962648). To demonstrate if the unique substrate specificity found in the crude trout enzyme is conveyed by a single enzyme, cDNA cloning of trout CMP-Sia synthetase was carried out by PCR-based strategy. The trout enzyme was shown to consist of 432 amino acids with two potential nuclear localization signals, and the cDNA sequence displayed 53.8% identity to that of the murine enzyme. Based on the Vmax/Km values, the recombinant trout enzyme had high activity toward both KDN and Neu5Ac (1.1 versus 0.68 min\x961). In contrast, the recombinant murine enzyme had 15 times lower activity toward KDN than Neu5Ac (0.23 versus 3.5 min\x961). Northern blot analysis suggested that several sizes of the mRNA are expressed in testis, ovary, and liver in a tissue-specific manner. These results indicate that at least one cloned enzyme has the ability to utilize both KDN and Neu5Ac as substrates efficiently and is useful for the production of CMP-KDN.'",2
"b'The main aim of the present study was to estimate total alcohol-related mortality in Sweden. For natural deaths, a meta-analysis carried out in Australia was updated to the end of March 1998, and pooled estimates of the relative risks were calculated for different diseases based on data from scientific studies that have been published in the international literature. The proportion of current alcohol drinkers from recent Swedish surveys, and the pooled relative risk estimates were used to estimate disease-specific alcohol-attributable fractions. Natural deaths \x91caused\x92 or \x91prevented\x92 by alcohol were estimated for the period 1992\x961996. For unnatural deaths, all cases from 1992 through 1996 in Sweden were analysed (n = 23 132). Alcohol was regarded to attribute to the death: if the deceased was a \x91known alcoholic\x92; if the underlying or contributing cause of death was alcohol-related; if the deceased had an alcohol-related in-patient diagnosis during a 3-year period prior to death; if the case tested positive for blood alcohol. Person years of life lost/gained (<70 years) due to alcohol were also assessed. The assumptions underlying the attributable risk methods used to analyse alcohol-related mortality due to natural causes need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results on natural deaths. Moreover, the preventive effect of alcohol on coronary heart disease and stroke is still controversial. The findings of alcohol-related mortality due to unnatural causes were much more reliable. About 3.5% of deaths were attributed to alcohol; alcohol involvement was more than twice as common in deaths of males (4.8%) than in those of females (2.0%). About one-quarter of the deaths in those aged below 50 years were attributed to alcohol. In those (<=69 years, alcohol had a net harmful effect in that it \x91caused\x92 more deaths than it \x91prevented\x92; 7% of deaths were in net \x91caused\x92. More person years of life were in net lost than were saved by alcohol, suggesting that alcohol has a negative effect on premature mortality. We conclude that alcohol accounted for about 3.5% of deaths in all ages, and 25% of deaths in those aged below 50 years, and about 10% of person years of life lost in Sweden. The balance of harm and benefit does not weigh in favour of making a recommendation to the public to drink in order to prevent death.'",0
"b'Background For a female population with a high lung cancer mortality rate, such as Taiwanese women, who smoke relatively rarely, but live in an environment with high male smoking prevalence, the risk and population burden of lung cancer due to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are relatively important.\r\n\r\nMethods An age-matched case-control study was designed to investigate the effects of cumulative environmental exposure to tobacco smoke during childhood and adult life on lung cancer risk among non-smoking women in Taiwan. Information on passive smoking from all possible sources and life periods were obtained from interviews with 268 and 445 lifetime non-smoking cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression and synergism \x91S\x92 index were applied to the data to assess the independent and joint effects of passive smoking in different life stages while controlling for possible confounding variables.\r\n\r\nResults Risks of contracting lung cancer among women near-distantly exposed to the highest level of ETS in childhood (>20 smoker-years) and in adult life (>40 smoker-years) were 1.8-fold (95% CI : 1.2\x962.9) and 2.2-fold (95% CI : 1.4\x963.7) higher than that among women being never exposed to ETS, and the two variables accounted for about 37% of tumours in this non-smoking female population. Children were found to be more susceptible to ETS than adults and such early exposure was found to modify the effect of subsequent tobacco smoke exposure in adult life based on an additive interaction model.\r\n\r\nConclusions Environmental tobacco smoke exposure occurring in childhood potentiates the effect of high doses of exposure in adult life in determining the development of lung cancer. Smoking prohibition would be expected to protect about 37% of non-smoking Taiwanese women against lung cancer.'",3

A registered nurse conducted a review of the children's medical files in each hospital. Demographic data and vital status were ascertained from the Israeli National Registry, using a unique identity number. Subsequently, the study cohort was linked with the Israeli National Cancer Registry, in order to identify cancer cases that had been diagnosed through December 1996, the last follow-up date of the study.\r\n\r\nResults Over 75% of the study participants were native-born; 56.2% were males. Approximately 78% of the cohort subjects were alive at the end of follow-up; 28.6% of the participants underwent more than one procedure. All of the diagnosed cases occurred in males. Expected number of malignancies for all sites was 4.75, while the observed number was 11.0 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 2.3; 95% CI : 1.2\x964.1). Of the 11cancer cases, 4 lymphomas were observed (0.63 were expected, SIR = 6.3; 95% CI : 1.7\x9616.2). One of these was Hodgkin's Disease. There were also three cases of melanoma as opposed to 0.62 expected (SIR = 4.9; 95% CI : 1.0\x9614.2).\r\n\r\nConclusions This finding is compatible with current knowledge about the carcinogenic effect of low-dose irradiation but differs in the occurrence of an excess of lymphoma in the absence of an excess of leukaemia, which has not been reported before. The dissonance between males and females is yet to be resolved.\r\n\r\nImplications Radiation doses that are used currently during cardiac catheterization are lower than in the past. Yet, the procedure is more common and frequently involves longer duration due to therapeutic interventions. The possible long-term results of such an exposure should be kept in mind.""",3
"b'We quantified cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Ca2+c) levels in cells dissociated from the embryonic (E) rat cortex during neurogenesis. Dualrecordings by flow cytometry using calcium and voltage-sensitive dyes revealed that, at the beginning of cortical development (E11\x9612), precursor cells exhibited either low (<100 nM), moderate (~250 nM) or high (>1 \xb5M) resting Ca2+c levels and well-polarized (\x9670 mV) or less-polarized (\x9640 mV) resting membrane potentials which reflected postmitotic or proliferative stages of the cell cycle. Ca2+c levels of all cells included a Ca2+o entry component, which was also Mn2+-permeant in actively proliferating precursors. Postmitotic, but not premitotic, precursors exhibited thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) stores, which had similar capacities throughout neuronal lineage development. Differentiating neurons, but not precursors expressed Ca2+i stores with ryanodine and caffeine sensitivity and baseline Ca2+c levels that depended on Na+\x96Ca2+ exchange activity. Voltage-dependent Ca2+o entry was not detected in precursors, but emerged during neuronal differentiation, with most of the neurons expressing functional L-type Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ imaging of individually immunoidentified cells acutely recovered in culture confirmed that precursors differentiate into neurons which stereotypically exhibit Ca2+o entry at the level of the membrane with increased Ca2+i release mechanisms on Ca2+i stores, Na+\x96Ca2+ exchange activity and expression of voltagedependent Ca2+ channels.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers/scientists are frequently quoted as expressing an awareness of potential harm associated with drinking during pregnancy. However, the statements attributed to these authors were not made by them. Instead, they are interpretations, presented in the form of verbatim statements, of their views relating to procreation. Although they did have something to say about the role of alcohol in procreation, it was the effects of drinking on the male body at the time of conception, and especially alcohol's effects on male body temperature, that concerned them. A cold body at the time of conception was believed to enhance the likelihood of conceiving a female, which to the Greeks and Romans was a \x91deformity\x92.""",0
"b'Eotaxin potentially plays an integral role in tissue eosinophilia. Inasmuch as Th2-derived cytokine IL-4 has been shown to stimulate eotaxin generation, we investigated here the effect of Th1-derived cytokine IFN-{gamma} on human eotaxin production. IFN-{gamma} but not -{alpha} or -\xdf potently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha}-induced eotaxin generation by dermal fibroblasts. The inhibitory effect was unique to eotaxin, because production of IL-8 or monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 protein was not affected by the treatment with IFN-{gamma}. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of IFN-{gamma} was not cell-type or stimulus specific. The level of eotaxin mRNA increased within 2 h after activation with TNF-{alpha} and continued to increase up to 72 h. IFN-{gamma} did not inhibit, but rather augmented the TNF-{alpha}-induced accumulation of mRNA in the early phase (~6 h). However, in the later phase, IFN-{gamma} completely prevented the subsequent elevation of eotaxin mRNA and sustained it at low levels. Although the protective effect of IFN-{gamma} against allergic inflammation has been assumed to result from its sole regulation of the proliferation of Th2-type T lymphocytes, these results imply that IFN-{gamma} can also directly act on stromal cells to inhibit eotaxin production and consequently intervene in eosinophil recruitment.'",4
"b'The Baltic Sea region today is a scene of a double transition: the eastern transformation and the western integration. As a consequence, alcohol-related issues are undergoing extensive changes. As part of a study of prevalence and perception of social problems around the Baltic Sea (the Baltica Study), alcohol issues have been studied from four perspectives: official statistics, mass media, public opinion and views of influential groups. The Baltic Sea region contains countries from the top and from the bottom of the European statistics on alcohol consumption (Latvia and Sweden respectively). Alcohol has been an important political issue in the transition of many countries (Russia and Poland just before the transition, Sweden and also Finland in their processes of European Union integration). For the medically oriented alcohol research community, the most important finding is that the medical profession and medical and epidemiological arguments play a secondary role in most of the countries when it comes to the definition of the problem.'",0
"b'Recombinant mammalian glycoproteins produced by the baculovirus\x96insect cell expression system usually do not have structurally authentic glycans. One reason for this limitation is the virtual absence in insect cells of certain glycosyltransferases, which are required for the biosynthesis of complex, terminally sialylated glycoproteins by mammalian cells. In this study, we genetically transformed insect cells with mammalian {beta}1,4-galactosyltransferase and {alpha}2,6-sialyltransferase genes. This produced a new insect cell line that can express both genes, serve as hosts for baculovirus infection, and produce foreign glycoproteins with terminally sialylated N-glycans.'",2
"b'In this study we have investigated the capacity of human fetal thymocytes to differentiate in vitro into subsets of T cells with polarized Th1 or Th2 cytokine profiles. Stimulation of freshly isolated human fetal thymocytes with anti-CD3 mAb, cross-linked onto CD32,CD58,CD80-expressing mouse fibroblasts and subsequent culture in the presence of exogenous rIL-2 for 6 days, induced the production of both IL-4 and IFN-{gamma}, which was mainly produced by CD4+ single-positive (SP) and CD8+ SP cells respectively. Addition of rIL-4 during priming augmented IL-4 production in cultures of human fetal thymocytes, which was mainly due to an increased production of IL-4 by CD8SP cells. In contrast, addition of IL-4 to the cultures only slightly enhanced IL-4 production and had little effect on frequencies of IL-4-producing CD4SP cells. Both CD4SP and CD8SP cells produced IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 at comparable levels, following priming in the presence of rIL-4. Priming in the presence of rIL-12 strongly enhanced the production of IFN-{gamma} in both CD4SP and CD8SP cells. No correlation between expression of CD27, CD30 and CD60, and a particular cytokine profile of differentiated thymocytes could be demonstrated. Together, these results demonstrate the full capacity of fetal human thymocytes to differentiate into cytokine-producing T cells in a priming milieu with appropriate stimulatory molecules and exogenous cytokines. In addition, CD4SP thymocytes rapidly differentiate into polarized Th2 cells following stimulation in vitro in the absence of exogenous rIL-4.'",4
"b'The most frequent type of N-glycan synthesized by lepidopteran Sf9 cells appears to be fucosylated Man3GlcNAc2, and this has been a limitation for a large scale production and utilization of therapeutic glycoproteins in cultured insect cells. The current knowledge of the protein glycosylation pathway derived from structural studies on recombinant glyco-proteins expressed by using baculovirus vectors. In this work we provide more direct evidence for the sequential events occurring in the processing of endogenous N-glycoproteins of noninfected Sf9 cells. By metabolic labeling with radioactive mannose, we characterized the glycan structures which accumulated in the presence of processing inhibitors (castanospermine and swainsonine) and in the presence of an intracellular trafficking inhibitor (monensin). We thus demonstrated that from the glycan precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to GlcNAcMan5(Fuc)GlcNAc2 intermediate, the processing pathwayin Sf9 cells paralleled the one demonstrated in mammalian cells. By using monensin, we demonstrated the formationof Man3(Fuc)GlcNAc2 from GlcNAcMan3(Fuc)GlcNAc2, a reaction which has not been described in mammalian cells. Our results support the idea that the hexosaminidase activity is of physiological relevance to the glycosylation pathway and is Golgi located.'",2
"b'The history of science tells us that the rise and fall of scientific disciplines depends on the successes and failures of respective research programmes rather than on the claims expressed and pressures exerted by individual members or groups. In this process, disciplines may even overcome their original paradigm by developing new cross-fertilizations, as is the case, for instance, in molecular biology. At a less prominent level, social epidemiology has evolved as one such cross-fertilization where theoretical and methodological knowledge and expertise derived from social and behavioural sciences (in particular sociology and psychology) have been introduced into epidemiology and public health research on determinants of human health and disease. In its short history social (or psychosocial) epidemiology has witnessed remarkable scientific progress. To mention just a few examples, a social gradient has been identified for a broad range of highly prevalent chronic diseases, and explanations of this gradient have been successfully advanced using models of health-related behaviour and of psychobiological stress research.1\x963 Measures of innovative sociological and psychological concepts were introduced into prospective epidemiological investigations, and their direct and indirect effects on disease incidence were estimated.\r\n\r\nExamples of newly discovered protective or risky psychosocial conditions for chronic diseases include social support,4 social network,5 high demand and low control at work,6 effort-reward imbalance,7 hostility,8 self-efficacy9 and optimism,10 among others. Above and beyond this prospectively established evidence some of these concepts have been associated with markers of psychobiological or pathophysiological mechanisms linking social environment and cognitive/affective processes in individuals with their physical responses.11\x9613\r\n\r\nInstead of evaluating this body of knowledge Zielhuis and Kiemeney14 put their energy into identifying a few authors who have used the term \x91social epidemiology\x92 in a broad way that does not reflect mainstream science. So what?\r\n\r\nIt is probably time to approach the problem of causality in biomedical epidemiology in a more critical way than is the case in the Zielhuis and Kiemeney article. Clearly, the causality criteria established by Hill15 in 1965 remain an important achievement, but we can no longer disregard epistemological advances taking place in contemporary biology and in a growing number of biomedical fields where modern systems theory calls into question simple notions of causality.16 It may well be that biopsychosocial research on health and illness is better equipped to face these challenges than traditional biomedical epidemiology.'",3
"b'We have determined the crystal structure of the methyl glycoside of Man [alpha]1-2 Man in complex with the carbohydrate binding legume lectin concanavalin A (Con A). Man [alpha]1-2 Man [alpha]-OMe binds more tightly to concanavalin A than do its [alpha]1-3 and [alpha]1-6 linked counterparts. There has been much speculation as to why this is so, including a suggestion of the presence of multiple binding sites for the [alpha]1-2 linked disaccharide. Crystals of the Man [alpha]1-2 Man [alpha]-OMe-Con A complex form in the space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 119.7 \xc5, b = 119.7 \xc5, c = 68.9 \xc5 and diffract to 2.75\xc5. The final model has good geometry and an R factor of 19.6% (Rfree = 22.8%). One tetramer is present in the asymmetric unit. In three of the four subunits, electron density for the disaccharide is visible. In the fourth only a monosaccharide is seen. In one subunit the reducing terminal sugar is recognized by the monosaccharide site; the nonreducing terminal sugar occupies a new site and the major solution conformation of the inter-sugar glycosidic linkage conformation is adopted. In contrast, in another subunit the non reducing terminal sugar sits in the so called monosaccharide binding site; the reducing terminal sugar adopts a different conformation about its inter-sugar glycosidic linkage in order for the methyl group to access a hydrophobic pocket. In the third subunit, electron density for both binding modes is observed. We demonstrate that an extended carbohydrate binding site is capable of binding the disaccharide in two distinct ways. These results provide an insight in to the balance of forces controlling protein carbohydrate interactions.'",2
"b'Background This paper examines (1) the accuracy of self-reported height, leg length and weight in a group of subjects aged 56\x9678; (2) whether recent measurement of height and weight influences the accuracy of self-reporting and (3) associations between childhood and adult height, leg length and BMI measured in old age.\r\n\r\nMethods All 3182 surviving members of the Boyd Orr cohort were sent postal questionnaires in 1997\x961998 and a sub-sample (294) was also clinically examined.\r\n\r\nResults Self-reported height was overestimated and body mass index (BMI), based on reported height and weight, underestimated. The mean difference between self-report and measured values were for height: 2.1 cm in males and 1.7 cm in females; for BMI the difference was \x961.3 kg/m2 in males and \x961.2 kg/m2 in females. Shorter individuals and older subjects tended to over-report their height more than others. The overweight under-reported their weight to a greater extent. Recent measurement appeared to decrease over-reporting of height but not weight. Correlations between self-report and measured height and BMI were generally over 0.90, but weaker for leg length (r = 0.70 in males and 0.71 in females). Adult height and leg length were quite closely related to their relative values in childhood (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.66 to 0.84), but associations between adult and childhood BMI were weak (r = 0.19 in males and 0.21 in females).\r\n\r\nConclusions Self-reported measures of height and weight may be used in studies of the elderly although systematic reporting errors may bias effect estimates. As overweight individuals tend to under-report and the short and underweight tend to over-report, studies investigating associations of disease with height and weight using self-reported measures will underestimate effects. The weak associations between childhood and adult BMI indicate that associations between childhood adiposity and adult cardiovascular disease found in this cohort may reflect the specific effect of childhood overweight, rather than its persistence into adulthood. This suggests that avoidance of adiposity may be as important in childhood as in adulthood.'",3
"b'We have chosen E. coli K92, which produces the alternating structure {alpha}(2-8)neuNAc {alpha}(2-9)neuNAc as a model system for studying bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. We have shown that the polysialyltransferase encoded by the K92 neuS gene can synthesize both {alpha}(2-8) and {alpha}(2-9) neuNAc linkages in vivo by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of polysaccharide isolated from a heterologous strain containing the K92 neuS gene. The K92 polysialyltransferase is associated with the membrane in lysates of cells harboring the neuS gene in expression vectors. Although the enzyme can transfer sialic acid to the nonreducing end of oligosaccharides with either linkage, it is unable to initiate chain synthesis without exogenously added polysialic acid. Thus, the polysialyltransferase encoded by neuS is not sufficient for de novo synthesis of polysaccharide but requires another membrane component for initiation. The acceptor specificity of this polysialyltransferase was studied using sialic acid oligosaccharides of various structures as exogenous acceptors. The enzyme can transfer to the nonreducing end of all bacteria polysialic acids, but has a definite preference for {alpha}(2-8) acceptors. Gangliosides containing neuNAc {alpha}(2-8)neuNAc are elongated, whereas monsialylated gangliosides are not. Disialylgangliosides are better acceptors than short oligosaccharides, suggesting a lipid-linked oligosaccharide may be preferred in the elongation reaction. These studies show that the K92 polysialyltransferase catalyzes an elongation reaction that involves transfer of sialic acid from CMP\x96sialic acid to the nonreducing end of two different acceptor substrates.'",2
"b'Background Although active smoking is well established as the main cause of lung cancer, there is accumulating evidence that history of prior lung diseases may be an independent risk factor for lung cancer.\r\n\r\nMethods A population-based case-control study in Gansu Province, China identified 886 lung cancer cases (656 male, 230 female) diagnosed between January 1994 and April 1998. A standardized interview collected information on a variety of potential risk factors including a history of physician-diagnosed non-malignant lung diseases (pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, asthma, pneumonia), age and year in which each condition was first diagnosed, and any therapy or hospitalization received.\r\n\r\nResults Pulmonary tuberculosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% CI : 1.4\x963.1) and chronic bronchitis/emphysema (OR = 1.4, 95% CI : 1.1\x961.8) were associated with increased risk of lung cancer, after adjustment for active smoking and socioeconomic status. The OR for asthma (OR = 1.4, 95% CI : 0.9\x962.1) and pneumonia (OR = 1.5, 95% CI : 1.0\x962.3) were also elevated. The risk of lung cancer remained significant for pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis/emphysema when analysis was limited to the pathologically confirmed cases and self-responders.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study provides additional evidence that previous pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis/emphysema are causally related to lung cancer, although the precise mechanism is still unclear. The results for asthma and pneumonia, while suggestive of a positive association, did not reach the traditional level of statistical significance and should be interpreted with caution.'",3
"b'Previous studies indicated that signaling through lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), a MHC class II ligand, induced by multivalent anti-receptor antibodies led to unresponsiveness to TCR stimulation. Here, lateral distribution of the LAG-3 molecules and its topological relationship (mutual proximity) to the TCR, CD8, CD4, and MHC class I and II molecules were studied in the plasma membrane of activated human T cells in co-capping experiments and conventional fluorescence microscopy. Following TCR engagement by either TCR-specific mAb or MHC\x96peptide complex recognition in T\x96B cell conjugates, LAG-3 was found to be specifically associated with the CD3\x96TCR complex. Similarly, following CD8 engagement LAG-3 and CD8 were co-distributed on the cell surface while only a low percentage of CD4-capped cells displayed LAG-3 co-caps. In addition, LAG-3 was found to be associated with MHC class II (i.e. DR, DP and DQ) and partially with MHC class I molecules. The supramolecular assemblies described here between LAG-3, CD3, CD8 and MHC class II molecules may result from an organization in raft microdomains, a phenomenon known to regulate early events of T cell activation.'",4
"b'Proliferating cells of the developing murine neocortex couple together into clusters during neurogenesis. Previously, we have shown that these clusters contain neural precursors in all phases of the cell cycle except M phase, and that they extend a nestin- expressing process from the cluster to the pial surface. In addition, coupling within neocortical cell clusters is a dynamic process related to the cell cycle, with maximal coupling in S/G2 phase, uncoupling in M phase and then recoupling during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. In the present study, we use immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that cycling neocortical cells as well as radial glial cells express the gap junction proteins connexin 26 and connexin 43. Furthermore, we demonstrate that biocytin labeled clusters extend processes to the pial surface that express the glial cell antigen RC2. Lastly, by combining bromodeoxyuridine and connexin immunohistochemistry on acutely dissociated neocortical cells, we show that the percentage of cycling cells immunoreactive to connexin 26 and connexin 43 changes through the cell cycle. These results indicate that radial glial cells as well as neural precursors couple into clusters, and suggest that through differential regulation of connexins, neocortical precursors may compartmentalize as they progress through the cell cycle.'",1
"b""Several isolated dimorphisms recur in many HLA class II alleles, but it is not clear whether they merely influence the binding of peptides locally or have more general effects on their recognition by T cells. For example, interchanges in HLA-DR\xdf include 86Gly {leftrightarrow} Val and 57Asp {leftrightarrow} Ser at either end of its {alpha} helix, and 71Arg {leftrightarrow} Lys in the middle. In DR4, the existence of six subtypes differing by single substitutions at these sites enabled us to assess their functional effects\x97both in isolation and in their natural context\x97on peptide presentation to a specific T cell clone with unusually broad cross-restrictions. Unexpectedly, the restriction imposed by 86Val was much more severe in the context of 71Arg than 71Lys, but was also more readily overcome by reducing the bulk of the `p1' peptide `anchor' residue (149Trp -> Phe). Moreover, when there was also a distant 57Asp->Ser substitution, compensating similarly for 86Val proved much more difficult. Thus 86Val and 57Ser in combination had far more drastic effects on peptide presentation than they did separately, when peptide binding was also largely unchanged. These and other interactions with position 71 together provide strong evidence that the configuration of the peptide\x96DR4 complex is critical for T cell recognition, which could be affected by subtle conformational influences on the p1\x969 core of the peptide or on the {alpha} helix of DR4\xdf (between positions 86 and 57). Ideally, therefore, the effects of individual class II substitutions should be considered in their natural context rather than in isolation.""",4
"b'A limited number of glycosylation products were generated in a cell-free system from a portion of the MUC2 tandem repeat, PTTTPITTTTK, when microsome fractions of human colon carcinoma LS174T cells were used as the source of UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminide:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (pp-GalNAc-T) in our previous work. The structures of all products suggested that there were only two biosynthetic pathways in the GalNAc incorporation into this peptide. In the present report, the putative biosynthetic intermediates, PTTT*PITTTTK (asterisk designates a GalNAc residue), PT*TTPITTTTK, PTT*T*PITT*T*TK, and PT*TTPIT*T*T*TK, of these two hypothetical pathways were used as acceptors to prove that these two pathways do exist. The incubation products of these glycopeptides, microsome fractions of LS174T cells, and UDP-GalNAc were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC and their structures were determined using MALDI-TOF MS and peptide sequencing. The products from PTTT*PITTTTK were PTTT*PITTT*TK, PTTT*PITT*T*TK, PTT*T*PI-TT*T*TK, PTT*T*PIT*T*T*TK, PT*T*T*PIT*T*T*TK, and PT*T*T*PIT*T*T*T*K. The products from PTT*-T*PITT*T*TK exactly corresponded to the products with five to seven GalNAc residues from PTTT*PITTTTK. The products from PT*TTPITTTTK were PT*TTPITT*TTK, PT*TTPIT*T*TTK, and PT*TTPIT*T*T*TK. PT*TTP-IT*T*T*TK was not converted further under the applied condition. All the products detected and analyzed were the same as those obtained when the unsubstituted peptide and microsome fractions of LS174T cells were incubated. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that LS174T cells contain at least four pp-GalNAc-Ts (-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4), suggesting that control of the order and the maximum number of GalNAc incorporation into this peptide is regulated through the coordinated actions of these and possibly other pp-GalNAc-Ts.'",2
"b'Previous studies have shown that cortical interneurons, presumably GABAergic, are among the targets of the noradrenaline (NA)-containing cortical afferents and that NA interacts with neuropeptides at various cellular levels. The present study attempts to characterize further the cortical targets of the NA afferents by examining, at the light and the electron microscopic level, the anatomical relationships of the NA fibers with three subpopulations of cortical interneurons, those containing somatostatin (SRIF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). For this purpose, a double preembedding immunoprocedure with antibodies against NA and SRIF, NPY or VIP was combined with the gold-substituted silver peroxidase method. Light microscopic examination showed that NA fibers contact perikarya and proximal dendrites of the SRIF, NPY and VIP neurons. However, NA fibers, while found to form pericellular arrays around NPY neurons and, to a lesser extent, around SRIF neurons, were seen to target VIP cortical cells with single terminal varicosities. Electron microscopy revealed that all peptidergic populations examined represent synaptic targets for the NA fibers. The NAergic synapses, localized onto the cell body and proximal dendrites of the peptidergic neurons, were always of the symmetrical variety. Results of the present study provide the morphological basis for the explanation of the functional interaction between the NA cortical afferent system and the intrinsic cortical elements.'",1
"b'The processing of single words that varied in their semantic (concrete/abstract word) and syntactic (content/function word) status was investigated under different task demands (semantic/ syntactic task) in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Task demands to a large degree determined which subparts of the neuronal network supporting word processing were activated. Semantic task demands selectively activated the left pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and the posterior part of the left middle/superior temporal gyrus (BA 21/22/37). In contrast, syntactic processing requirements led to an increased activation in the inferior tip of the left frontal operculum (BA 44) and the cortex lining the junction of the inferior frontal and inferior precentral sulcus (BA 44/6). Moreover, for these latter areas a word class by concreteness interaction was observed when a syntactic judgement was required. This interaction can be interpreted as a prototypicality effect: non-prototypical members of a word class, i.e. concrete function words and abstract content words, showed a larger activation than prototypical members, i.e. abstract function words and concrete content words. The combined data suggest that the activation pattern underlying word processing is predicted neither by syntactic class nor semantic concreteness but, rather, by task demands focusing either on semantic or syntactic aspects. Thus, our findings that semantic and syntactic aspects of processing are both functionally distinct and involve different subparts of the neuronal network underlying word processing support a domain-specific organization of the language system.'",1
"b'Background Face-to-face assessment of research outcomes is expensive and may introduce bias. Postal questionnaires offer a cheaper alternative which avoids observer bias, but non-response and incomplete response reduce the effective sample size and may be equally serious sources of bias. This study examines the extent and potential effects of missing data in the postal collection of outcomes for a large rehabilitation trial.\r\n\r\nMethods Questionnaires containing a number of established scales were posted to participants in a trial of occupational therapy after stroke. Response was maximized by telephone and postal reminders, and incomplete questionnaires were followed up by telephone. Scale scores obtained by imputing values to questionnaire items missing on return were compared with those achieved by telephone follow-up.\r\n\r\nFindings Response to the initial posting was 60%, rising to 85% after reminders. Participants receiving the experimental treatment were more likely to respond without a reminder. There were no significant differences on any known factors between eventual responders and non-responders. Of the questionnaires, 43% were incomplete on return: partial responders were significantly different to complete responders on baseline disability and home circumstances. Of the incomplete questionnaires, 71% were resolved by telephone follow-up. In these, the scale scores achieved by telephone were generally higher than those derived by conventional imputation.\r\n\r\nConclusion Postal outcome assessment achieved a good response rate, but considerable effort was needed to minimize non-response and incomplete response, both of which could have been serious sources of bias.'",3
"b'Gut-derived endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) complexed to LPS-binding protein (LBP) activate liver Kupffer cells via their CD14 receptor. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are released and this is postulated to promote liver injury. We previously demonstrated enhanced expression of CD14 endotoxin receptor after 2 weeks of alcohol administration. A similar result, based on 6 weeks of ethanol treatment, was recently reported and suggested to correlate with alcohol-induced liver injury. To establish whether this occurs prior to or after the initiation of damage, we investigated the temporal effect of continuous ethanol exposure on the expression of CD14 and the associated LBP. In addition, we studied the effect of treatment with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) that inactivates Kupffer cells and alleviates alcohol-induced liver damage. The amount of CD14 and LBP mRNA, as determined by reverse transcriptase\x96polymerase chain reaction (RT\x96PCR), was unchanged 4\x968 h after intragastric ethanol administration. However, after 24\x9648 h of repeated ethanol administration, CD14 and LBP mRNA both increased significantly and reached a level similar to that observed after 6 weeks of ethanol exposure by liquid diet. Immunostaining experiments with ED2 antibody demonstrated that GdCl3 efficiently inactivated Kupffer cells. However, there was no concomitant reduction in the expression of CD14 mRNA, suggesting that compensatory infiltration by ED2-negative, but CD14-positive, macrophages had occurred. Our results demonstrate that soon after the initiation of ethanol exposure, i.e. within 24\x9648 h, the hepatic expression of both the CD14 receptor and LBP is increased. This suggests that these increases could contribute to the initiation of alcoholic damage rather than being a consequence of the injury.'",0
"b'Isolated murine splenic B cells gradually undergo spontaneous apoptosis while WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells undergo activation-induced apoptosis. Unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in a particular sequence context (CpG motif) in bacterial DNA or in synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG DNA) rescue both splenic B cells and WEHI-231 cells from apoptosis, an effect which could potentially contribute to autoimmune disease. Chloroquine has been used as an effective therapeutic agent for some autoimmune diseases, although the mechanism of action is not clearly understood. Low concentrations of chloroquine (<5 \xb5M) selectively abolished CpG DNA-mediated protection against spontaneous apoptosis of splenic B cells and against anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells without affecting anti-apoptotic activities of anti-CD40 or lipopolsaccharide. CpG DNA effectively prevented mitochondrial membrane potential disruption through a chloroquine-sensitive pathway in splenic B cells. Apoptosis protection by CpG DNA was also associated with increased expression of several proto-oncogenes and oncoproteins directly and/or indirectly through a rapid and sustained activation of NF{kappa}B in splenic B cells and WEHI-231 cells. These effects were also suppressed by chloroquine. Our results suggest that despite the difference in maturation phenotype of splenic B cells and WEHI-231 cells, CpG DNA rescues both from apoptosis by similar pathway, which is blocked at an early step by chloroquine.'",4
"b'In plants as well as in animals [beta]1,2N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI) is a Golgi resident enzyme that catalyzes an essential step in the biosynthetic pathway leading from oligomannosidic N-glycans to complex or hybrid type N-linked oligosaccharides. Employing degenerated primers deduced from known GlcNAc-TI genes from animals, we were able to identify the cDNA coding for GlcNAc-TI from a Nicotiana tabacum cDNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence revealed a 1338 base pair open reading frame that codes for a polypeptide of 446 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that of already known GlcNAc-TI polypeptides revealed no similarity of the tobacco clone within the putative cytoplasmatic, transmembrane, and stem regions. However, 40% sequence similarity was found within the putative C-terminal catalytic domain containing conserved single amino acids and peptide motifs. The predicted domain structure of the tobacco polypeptide is typical for type II transmembrane proteins and comparable to known GlcNAc-TI from animal species. In order to confirm enzyme activity a truncated form of the protein containing the putative catalytic domain was expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell system. Using pyridylaminated Man5- or Man3GlcNAc2 as acceptor substrates and HPLC analysis of the products GlcNAc-TI activity was shown. This demonstrates that the C-terminal region of the protein comprises the catalytic domain. Expression of GlcNAc-TI mRNA in tobacco leaves was detected using RT-PCR.

DP molecules were specifically retarded on a column of the FN1 immunosorbent; binding of FITC-labeled FN1 to B cell lines was completely blocked by excess of mAb to DR/DP \xdf chains, partially by several mAb to DP and weakly by some mAb to DR. The binding of two other CDw78 mAb, FN4 and MR11, to the B cell surface was most strongly inhibited by excess of different mAb to DR. Kinetics of stable binding of the CDw78 mAb indicated that their monovalent binding is of low affinity and that the stable binding to the surface is due to bivalent binding to two spatially close MHC class II molecules. FN1-based immunosorbent effectively immunoisolated complexes of MHC class II proteins with several tetraspanin molecules from a mild detergent lysate of a B cell line. It is concluded that FN1 and most likely also the other two CDw78 mAb recognize with low affinity determinants on MHC class II molecules (DP or DR) and preferentially bind in a stable fashion to dimerized or aggregated MHC class II molecules. Such dimers or aggregates may either exist as preformed on the cell surface or may be gradually formed and stabilized by bivalent interaction with mAb. These structures may be related to the previously described `superdimers' of MHC class II and/or `MHC\x96tetraspanin complexes'. CDw78 mAb may be valuable tools targeting such aggregated fraction of MHC class II molecules which can exhibit important signaling and antigen-presenting properties.""",4
"b'Background Subfecundity is a frequent and often serious problem and it is important to identify its preventable determinants and to monitor fecundity over time. Since follow-up studies are difficult and expensive to conduct, time to pregnancy (TTP) in pregnant women is often used as a surrogate measure of fecundity. TTP data can be retrieved at low costs and they need no valid population registry as a source for sampling. While TTP may serve as a valid surrogate measure in many situations, its validity rests upon a number of assumptions. We have analysed one of these overlooked assumptions, the importance of persistence in trying to become pregnant.\r\n\r\nMethods By means of computer simulations we estimated bias caused by differences in persistence in pregnancy attempts. We investigated whether the assumptions made in the simulation were realistic by using empirical data from a European study.\r\n\r\nResults The mean waiting time to pregnancy and other estimates of subfecundity (or infertility) strongly depend upon the persistence of couples in pursuing a pregnancy. We show that even moderate changes in the planning behaviour considerably modify the waiting time distribution. Empirical data confirm that persistence in trying to become pregnant is age-related.\r\n\r\nConclusions Persistence in pregnancy attempts affects outcome measures of subfecundity in studies based upon TTP in pregnant women. It is likely that the length of time during which couples keep trying to become pregnant is influenced by a number of factors which would probably change over time or be different between populations to be compared.'",3
"b'Adult atopic dermatitis (AD) patients develop severe facial lesions, which sometimes distribute in sun-exposed areas similar to the rash of systemic lupus erythematosus. To declare autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of AD, we investigated serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) in 256 adult AD patients and identified its ligands. A high titer of ANA was found in 31.3% of AD patients and 75% of the ANA showed a homogenous pattern. Sixty-five percent of ANA+ sera reacted to a 52 kDa protein (p52) in HeLa cell immunoblots. By screening the HeLa cell cDNA expression library with anti-p52 sera, a clearly positive clone was isolated. The sequence of this cDNA was identical to human elongation factor (hEF)-1{alpha}. The eluate of IgG bound to hEF-1{alpha}\x96glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein recognized a band at 52 kDa in a HeLa cell immunoblot, and stained Hep-2 cell nuclei and cytoplasma as reported in hEF-1{alpha} distribution. The anti-p52 AD sera recognized the hEF-1{alpha}\x96GST fusion protein. The anti-hEF-1{alpha} antibody-positive AD patients were characterized by higher facial involvement and lower white blood cell counts compared with antibody-negative patients. The present results suggest the possible involvement of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of adult AD.'",4
"b'The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has different isoforms due to different sizes in its polypeptide and plays a significant role in neural development. In neural development, the function of NCAM is modified by polysialylation catalyzed by two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV. Previously, it was reported by others that ST8Sia II polysialylates only transmembrane isoforms of the NCAM, such as NCAM-140 and NCAM-180, but not NCAM-120 and NCAM-125 anchored by a glycosylphosphotidylinositol. In the present study, we first discovered that ST8Sia II polysialylates all isoforms of the NCAM examined, and we demonstrated that polysialylation of NCAM expressed on 3T3 cells facilitates neurite outgrowth regardless of isoforms of NCAM, where polysialic acid is attached. We then show that neurite outgrowth is significantly facilitated only when polysialylated NCAM is present in cell membranes. Moreover, the soluble NCAM coated on plates did not have an effect on neurite outgrowth exerted by soluble L1 adhesion molecule coated on plates. These results, taken together, indicate that ST8Sia II plays critical roles in modulating the function of all major isoforms of NCAM. The results also support previous studies showing that a signal cascade initiated by NCAM differs from that initiated by L1 molecule.'",2
"b'Background The objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of cause-of-death coding, determine the extent to which coders follow the selection rules of coding set out in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), and the effects of miscoding on mortality statistics in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nMethod A systematic sample of 5621 death certificates was reviewed. The underlying cause of death (UCD) selected by the reviewer for each death certificate was compared with that selected by the original coder. The UCD was selected according to ACME (Automated Classification of Medical Entities)\r\nResults The overall agreement rates between the reviewer and coders according to the three-digit and two-digit categories of ICD-9 were 80.9% and 83.9%, respectively. Good agreement was found for malignant neoplasms (kappa = 0.94) and injuries and poisoning (kappa = 0.97), but there was poor agreement for nephrotic diseases (kappa = 0.74), hypertension-related diseases (kappa = 0.74), and cerebral infarction (kappa = 0.77). Reasons for disagreements included disagreement in nomenclature (42.8%), inappropriate judgement of causal relationships (41.5%), and incorrect interpretation of Selection Rule 3 and Modification Rules (15.7%).\r\nConclusion This study showed various levels of agreement for different diseases between the reviewer and the original coders in selection of the UCD. Owing to the \x91compensatory effect of errors\x92, the national mortality statistics were not affected significantly. The national administration should undertake routine internal studies to control the quality of UCD coding practices.'",3
"b'The compositional complexity of the mycobacterial cell envelope differentiates Mycobacterium species from most other prokaryotes. Historically, research in this area has focused on the elucidation of the structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope with the result that the structures of the mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex from M. tuberculosis are fairly well understood. However, the current impetus for studying M. tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacteria is the need to identify targets for the development of new drugs. Therefore, emphasis has been shifting to the study of cell envelope biosynthesis and the identification of enzymes that are essential to the viability of M. tuberculosis. The publication of the complete M. tuberculosis genome in 1998 has greatly aided these studies. To date, thirteen enzymes involved in the synthesis of the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex of M. tuberculosis have been identified and at least partially characterized. Eleven of these enzymes were reported subsequent to the publication of the M. tuberculosis genome, a clear indication of the rapid evolution of knowledge stimulated by the sequencing of the genome. In this article we review the current understanding of M. tuberculosis arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan structure and biosynthesis.'",2
"b'Background A population-based study on prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiple births has not been carried out in China. The purpose of this paper was to determine the prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiple births and to explore the influence of multiple pregnancy on cerebral palsy after controlling for birthweight.\r\n\r\nMethods A cross-sectional study of cerebral palsy was carried out among 388 192 children aged <7 years in seven cities of Jiangsu province in China. Information about birthweight and plurality was obtained from routine health care records. Pediatricians at city level diagnosed all cases. All the doctors involved had taken part in a training programme held by Beijing Medical University. Stratified analysis by birthweight and its standard normal deviate was employed to compare the prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiples and singletons.\r\n\r\nResults The prevalence of cerebral palsy for children aged <7 years in multiples was 9.7 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5\x9614.0), which was 6.5 times that in singletons (95% CI : 4.4\x969.3). The overall neonatal mortality rate was 60.9 per 1000 liveborn multiples, being highest (944.4 per 1000) in the 500\x96999 g birthweight groups. Most liveborn multiples weighing <1500 g at birth probably died from diseases related to very low birthweight prior to this study. The prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiple births was likely to be higher than that reported in developed countries for children weighing 1500\x962499 g even though our data were from a cross-sectional study. When stratified by birthweight, the prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiples weighing <2500 g had tended to be lower than that of singletons in the same birthweight group. In contrast, in normal birthweight categories multiple births had a higher prevalence of cerebral palsy than singletons. When stratified by birthweight normal deviate, the prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiple births was uniformly higher than that in singletons in all birthweight strata and the prevalence of cerebral palsy among multiples appeared to be augmented as birthweight increased.\r\n\r\nConclusion The prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiples, 9.7 per 1000 children, is 6.5 times that in singletons. Survival of low birthweight infants is lower in China than in developed countries and survival quality of Chinese children weighing 1500\x962499 g needs to be further improved. In terms of birthweight multiples and singletons may be heterogeneous. It might be difficult to directly use actual birthweight specific prevalence to compare the prevalence of cerebral palsy in multiples and singletons. Birthweight normal deviate specific prevalence of cerebral palsy suggests that multiple pregnancy is an independent risk factor for cerebral palsy in all birthweight groups. Multiples are in adverse circumstances very early in gestation and as the foetus matures the risk of cerebral palsy increases.'",3
"b'Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a CD4+ T cell-mediated, inflammatory disease with similarities to multiple sclerosis in humans. Intranasal (i.n.) administration of a myelin basic protein (MBP)-derived peptide can protect susceptible mice from EAE. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, however, remain unclear. To analyze the phenotypic and functional changes taking place during the induction of tolerance by peptide inhalation, we have studied the fate of CD4+ T cells after i.n. peptide application using transgenic mice expressing a TCR specific for the N-terminal peptide (Ac1\x969) of MBP. Peripheral T cell death was variably observed in TCR transgenic mice after a single i.n. administration of antigenic peptide but was transient and incomplete. Transgenic spleen cells and cervical lymph node cells responded with a cytokine burst to peptide inhalation and hyperproliferation when re-stimulated in vitro. Transfer experiments demonstrated that the duration of peptide administration required to induce tolerance depended on the precursor frequency of T cells in recipient animals. The stringency of i.n. peptide treatment was increased so as to test the efficacy of tolerance induction both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of high precursor frequencies of antigen-specific T cells. Multiple i.n. doses of peptide completely protected TCR transgenic mice from EAE induced with myelin. Such repeated peptide administration resulted in down-regulation of the capacity of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells to proliferate or to produce IL-2, IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 but increased the production of IL-10. The role of IL-10 in suppression of EAE in vivo was demonstrated by neutralization of IL-10. This completely restored susceptibility to EAE in mice previously protected by i.n. peptide. Considering the immunosuppressive properties of IL-10, T cells which are resistant to apoptosis might act as regulatory cells and mediate bystander suppression.'",4
"b'The ectoenzyme {gamma}-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) hydrolyzes glutathione (GSH), is required for the maintenance of normal intracellular GSH levels and modifies the activity of GSH-containing adducts. Previous data suggested that this enzyme was present on mitogen-activated T lymphocytes. However, the level of GGT protein expression on human mononuclear cell subsets has not been determined. A novel mAb to human GGT, 3A8, was developed. 3A8 was used to show that the expression of GGT is, in fact, highest on resting T cells that express markers of the memory phenotype, specifically CD45RO and decreased expression of CD45RB. The peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was found to have expanded numbers of T cells expressing levels of GGT up to 10-fold higher than controls. In addition, the CD4+ T cell subset with the capacity to migrate across a human endothelial cell monolayer expresses high GGT levels. GGT expression was up-regulated on peripheral blood T cells following activation in vitro by either superantigen, phorbol ester, or IL-15, a stimulatory cytokine synthesized in rheumatoid synovium. Resting peripheral blood T cells that express GGT have higher levels of intracellular thiols than those that do not. These observations suggest that GGT may play an important role in the regulation of lymphocytes that are at a particular developmental stage.'",4
"b'Specific human milk oligosaccharides, especially fucosylated neutral oligosaccharides, protect infants against specific microbial pathogens. To study the concentrations of individual neutral oligosaccharides during lactation, a total of 84 milk samples were obtained from 12 women at 7 time periods during weeks 1\x9649 postpartum. The neutral oligosaccharides from each sample were isolated, perbenzoylated, resolved, and quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The resultant oligosaccharide peaks, identified by co-elution with authentic standards and mass spectrometry, ranged in size from tri- to octasaccharides. The total concentration of oligosaccharides declined over the course of lactation; the mean concentration at 1 year was less than half that in the first few weeks postpartum. One of the 12 donors produced milk fucosyloligosaccharides that were essentially devoid of {alpha}1,2 linkages (but contained {alpha}1,3- and {alpha}1,4-linked fucose) until late in lactation, consistent with the nonsecretor phenotype. In milk samples from the remaining 11 donors, fucosyloligosaccharides containing {alpha}1,2-linked fucose were prevalent, and their profiles were distinct from those of fucosyloligosaccharides devoid of {alpha}1,2-linked fucose. The ratio of {alpha}1,2-linked oligosaccharide concentrations to oligosaccharides devoid of {alpha}1,2-linked fucose changed during the first year of lactation from 5:1 to 1:1. Furthermore, the absolute and the relative concentrations of individual oligosaccharides varied substantially, both between individual donors and over the course of lactation for each individual. The patterns of milk oligosaccharides among individuals suggest the existence of many genotype subpopulations. This variation in individual oligosaccharide concentrations suggests that the protective activities of human milk could also vary among individuals and during lactation.'",2
"b't has been previously demonstrated that hybrid Ty virus-like particles (VLP) prime effective CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. In this study, we investigated the effect of treating mice with Ty VLP carrying the immunodominant epitope of Der p 1 after sensitizing them to the group 1 allergen of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p 1), under conditions that induce Th2 immunity. We show that i.p. treatment with the hybrid VLP abrogated allergen-specific IL-5 production and reduced allergen-specific cell proliferation. This suppression of the response was mediated by CD4+ T cells and was not accompanied by an increase in IFN-{gamma} production.'",4
"b'There has been a long debate about a possible homology between parts of the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) of reptiles and birds, and parts of the mammalian isocortex. Correspondence between these structures was originally proposed on the basis of connectional similarities between the DVR of birds and the mammalian auditory and extrastriate visual isocortical areas. Furthermore, the proposal of homology includes the possible embryological similarity of cells that give rise to the DVR and cells that give rise to the isocortex. Against this concept it has been claimed that the DVR and the isocortex originate in topographically different pallial compartments, an interpretation that is supported by recent developmental and molecular data. Other studies indicate that migrating cells can cross the borders between adjacent developmental compartments: cells that originate in subcortical components contribute a number of interneurons to the developing isocortex via tangential migration. This mechanism might reconcile the proposed homology with the developmental evidence, since cells originating in one compartment (the one corresponding to DVR) may become included in structures generated in a different compartment (the one corresponding to isocortex). However, there is no evidence in mammals of a structure homologous to the embryonic DVR that can produce isocortical neurons. In order to fully clarify the problem of isocortical origins, further comparative studies are needed of the embryonic development of the lateral and dorsal aspects of the cerebral hemispheres in amphibians, reptiles and mammals.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We have analyzed in organotypic rat visual cortex cultures the way in which expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA depends on synaptically generated spontaneous bioelectric activity (SBA) as monitored by recordings of pyramidal cells. SBA was initially low, but from the fourth week onwards 83% of the neurons fired action potentials at 0.2\x961.2 impulses/s in a well-balanced state of excitation and inhibition. BDNF mRNA expression increased during the second week to a level surprisingly similar to the adult visual cortex in vivo, despite the fact that activity rates in vitro were ~10-fold lower than rates reported in vivo. Thus, SBA generated by a cortical neuronal network in the absence of sensory input is sufficient to elicit and maintain BDNF expression. The transient BDNF peak occurring after eye opening in vivo did not occur in vitro. A blockade of SBA seems not to alter the expression of neurotrophin (NT)-3 and -4/5, and tyrosine kinase receptor C and B mRNA. However, BDNF expression remained extremely low. A recovery of SBA after a period of blockade concurred with a transient hyperexcitability. BDNF immediately increased, driven by calcium influx through voltage-gated channels in synergy with NMDA receptors. Expression transiently reached high levels in neurons of supragranular layers. Infragranular neurons, although firing action potentials, recovered BDNF expression much slower. After 5 days in vitro recovery, the network had de novo established a balanced state of excitation and inhibition. Distribution and expression level of BDNF mRNA had returned to control. Even in \x91adult\x92 cultures an acute blockade of SBA downregulated BDNF, and a subsequent recovery of SBA restored BDNF expression. We conclude that BDNF mRNA expression depends on and responds with a fast kinetic to changes of the SBA. Steady-state levels do not depend on the absolute levels of activity, but more likely on the balance between excitation and inhibition, suggesting a role for BDNF in activity homeostasis.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics have proven to be invaluable pharmaceuticals for the treatment of chronic and life-threatening diseases. Although these molecules are extraordinarly efficacious, many diseases have high dosage requirements of several hundred milligrams of protein for each administration. Multiple doses at this level are often required for treatment. One of the major challenges currently facing the biotechnology industry is the development of large-scale, cost-effective production and manufacturing processes of these biologically synthesized molecules. Metabolic engineering of animal cell expression hosts promises to address this challenge by substantially enhancing recombinant protein quality, productivity, and biological activity. In this report, we describe a novel approach to metabolic engineering in Chinese hamster ovary cells by control of endogenous gene expression. Analysis of the advantages and limitations of using antisense DNA and gene targeting as a means of control are discussed and several gene candidates for regulation with these techniques are identified. Practical considerations for using these technologies to reduce the levels of the CHO cell sialidase (Warner et al., Glycobiology, 3, 455-463, 1993) as a model gene system for regulation are also presented.'",2
"b'The [beta]-chain of human interleukin 12 (IL-12) contains at position 319-322, the sequence Trp-x-x-Trp. In human RNase 2 this is the recognition motif for a new, recently discovered posttranslational modification, i.e., the C-glycosidic attachment of a mannosyl residue to the side chain of tryptophan. Analysis of C-terminal peptides of recombinant IL-12 (rHuIL-12) by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy revealed that Trp-319[beta] is (partially) C-mannosylated. This finding was extended by in vitro mannosylation experiments, using a synthetic peptide derived from the same region of the protein as an acceptor. Furthermore, human B-lymphoblastoid cells, which secrete IL-12, were found to contain an enzyme that carries out the C-mannosylation reaction. This shows that nonrecombinant IL-12 is potentially C-mannosylated as well. This is only the second report on a C-mannosylated protein. However, the occurrence of the C-mannosyltransferase activity in a variety of cells and tissues, and the presence of the recognition motif in many proteins indicate that more C-mannosylated proteins may be found.'",2
"b'Recordings were made from pairs of neurons in cat striate visual cortex in vitro to study the AMPA-channel-mediated components of intracortical excitatory synaptic connections between layer 4 spiny neurons and between layer 6 and layer 4 spiny neurons. Forty-six of the 72 cells recorded were identified morphologically. They consisted of spiny stellate and pyramidal cells in layer 4, and pyramidal cells in layer 6. Connections between layer 4 excitatory cells involve excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) averaging 949 \xb5V, with an average coefficient of variation of 0.21 (n = 30). The synapses operate at very high release probabilities (0.69\x960.98). With repetitive stimulation these EPSPs show varying degrees of depression, largely mediated by presynaptic changes in release probability. Four pairs of layer 4 cells were reciprocally connected. The connections from layer 6 to layer 4 involve smaller, more variable EPSPs, with an average amplitude of 214 \xb5V, and average coefficient of variation 0.72 (n = 7). These synapses operate at moderately high release probabilities (0.37\x960.56). They show facilitation with repetitive stimulation, mediated largely by presynaptic changes in release probability. One excitatory connection from a layer 4 neuron to a layer 6 pyramidal cell was also detected. Thus, layer 4 spiny neurons receive effective excitation from two intracortical sources that have different synaptic dynamics and are likely to contribute significantly to the temporal properties of these cells in vivo.'",1
"b'Sir\x97The call for improved standards in questionnaire design in epidemiology1 is long overdue. The proposed clearing house, committee or working group would likely improve standards. The further proposal of setting up workshops or task forces to address specific issues may also promote better practice. The risk attached to institutionalizing reference points for good practice, however, is that the virtues of validity and comparability become the pressure for conformity.\r\n\r\nEasier access to questionnaires is welcome. The benefit of a clearing house, however, is not a straightforward issue of facilitating research. Questionnaires and their findings can have clinical and legal, and increasingly, commercial significance. Unless the contents of a clearing house were limited to research tools of unknown validity and significance it is inconceivable that rules and conditions of access would not be required.\r\n\r\nGathering experts to administrate a resource could define a committee. The responsible administration of questionnaires has much to commend it. Professional bodies in Psychology have practised it for many years. In Epidemiology, however, the potential for questionnaire use is so broad, that quite apart from encroaching on the expertise of other disciplines, the task is unworkable. A way forward might be to include only those questionnaires used for medical diagnosis. Sadly, this would defeat much of the object of a general improvement in questionnaire use throughout the discipline.\r\n\r\nWe all applaud the standardization of procedures, but can a working group achieve this? In fact, this is the heart of the problem. How can a working group set standards for best practice given the range and variety of questionnaire use in Epidemiology? Standardization may be a necessary part of an ongoing process of reducing uncertainty in data, but the real \x91standard\x92, of course, is comparability of findings. The critical parameters of questionnaire use, those which provide comparable findings, are a matter for research not opinion. Appropriate levels of standardization in any area of research will only come through the comparison of results from a known range of varied practice; not from the deliberations of a working group.\r\n\r\nAt one level, any vehicle which improves the quality of questionnaire data in epidemiology generally, is welcome. It is worth noting, however, that members of the scientific community have a vested interest in improving standards once the issues are understood and publicly acknowledged. Rather than institutionalize the process of improving questionnaire use, perhaps a more fundamental approach is to stimulate the quality of public debate and understanding, in order to improve the judgement of the researcher.2,3 A task which your leading article attempted admirably.'",3
"b""Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a non-volatile, water-soluble, stable-upon-storage, direct metabolite of ethanol and can be detected in body fluids and tissues (and also in post-mortem material) for an extended time period after the complete elimination of alcohol from the body (Alt et al., 1997Go; Schmitt et al., 1997Go; Seidl et al., 1998Go; Wurst et al., 1999aGo,bGo). The aim of the present Letter is to emphasize through our preliminary results that the detection of alcohol consumption that has taken place several weeks or months earlier, via the determination of EtG in hair, could be a useful forensic tool as well as for monitoring alcohol consumption of those in treatment for alcohol dependence.\r\n\r\nThirty-one hair samples from four groups of subjects were analysed: (1) hair was taken post mortem from 16 subjects with a known history of alcoholism; the diagnosis was established by police investigations including information from the subjects' family practitioners; (2) hair from four alcoholics (diagnosed according to ICD-10), who were hospitalized at the Alcohol and Drug Unit, Department of Psychiatry II, University of Ulm, Germany; (3) hair from six social drinkers with a self-reported alcohol consumption of up to 20 g/day; (4) hair from five children.\r\n\r\nThe proximal 2\x968-cm hair segment was used for analysis. The hair samples were first washed with methanol and acetone (10 ml, 5 min) and were then cut into small pieces with an approximate length of 1 mm without any subdivision into segments. To a total of 100 mg of the cut hair samples, 100 ng deuterium-labelled (d5)-EtG (Medichem, Stuttgart, Germany) as internal standard and 2 ml demineralized water were added. After ultrasonication for 2 h at 30\xb0C, the supernatants were separated after centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min), transferred into gas chromatograph vials and evaporated at 30\xb0C under nitrogen. Following evaporation, 50 \xb5l pyridine (Merck) and 100 \xb5l BSTFA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide; Merck) were added. The samples were vortex mixed and then placed in an incubator at 90\xb0C for 30 min. After evaporation, the residues were dissolved in 50 \xb5l ethyl acetate (Merck) for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis.\r\n\r\nGC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5973 mass selective detector. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm (0.25 \xb5m film thickness) HP-5MS (Hewlett Packard) column operated in the splitless mode with valve closed for 0.5 min. The carrier gas was helium. Injector and detector temperatures were 250\xb0C and 280\xb0C, respectively. Oven temperature was set for 100\xb0C for 2 min, then increased at a rate of 15\xb0C/min to 250\xb0C and, finally, at 20\xb0C/min to 280\xb0C, which was maintained for 3 min. The total run time was 17.5 min. Data were acquired in the SIM-mode. The TMS-derivatives were identified with the following masses: m/z 160, 261, and 405 (target ion) for EtG and m/z 165, 266, and 410 for TMS-d5-EtG. For quantitative evaluation of EtG in hair samples, calibration graphs were created by adding EtG concentrations between 50 ng and 300 ng to the hair samples from the children.\r\n\r\nIn 18 out of 31 hair samples analysed, EtG was detected. The characterization of the hair samples as well as the results.Measurable concentrations of EtG were not detected in the hair from six social drinkers with a daily consumption of up to 20 g ethyl alcohol or in the hair from the five children.\r\nThe analysis of EtG in hair might help judge a claimed longer period of abstinence. It remains to be elucidated why EtG could not be detected in two cases (subjects 14 and 26) despite a known history of alcohol misuse. The colour of hair as well as the use of hair colourings could be of importance in this issue. In cases where EtG is not detected alcohol consumption cannot be excluded. However, if the analysis of EtG in hair is positive, alcohol consumption has to be strongly assumed. In interpreting the results, external sources for EtG, e.g. sweat, have to be taken into consideration in every case. It remains to be shown whether or not a correlation between the amount of alcohol consumed and the EtG concentration in hair can be established. Our preliminary data indicate that it might be possible to discriminate social drinkers (up to 20 g/day) from alcoholics and to monitor abstinence by the determination of EtG in hair.""",0
"b'The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a useful host for the production of heterologous proteins through the secretory pathway. However, because of the potential antigenicity of mannan-type sugar chains in humans, yeast cannot be used as a host for the production of glycoprotein therapeutics. To overcome this problem, we are trying to breed a yeast which can produce hybrid- or complex-type carbohydrates. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:[alpha]-3-d-mannoside [beta]-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT-I) is essential for the conversion of high mannose-type N-glycans to hybrid- and complex-type ones. As yeast lacks this enzyme, we have introduced the rat GnT-I cDNA into yeast cells. The transformed yeast cells expressed GnT-I activity in vitro. The expressed GnT-I was localized in all organella, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vacuole, suggesting that the mammalian Golgi retention signal of GnT-I did not function in yeast cells. Analysis of the GnT-I gene product with a c-Myc epitope tag at the C-terminus elucidates that the N-terminal region of GnT-I, including the mammalian Golgi retention signal, should be removed in the yeast ER.'",2

First, by means of an extensive CDR3\xdf sequencing strategy, we show that the naive peripheral CD8 T cell repertoire does not exhibit a major imprint of IF antigens. Second, using MHC\x96peptide tetramers, CDR3\xdf length distribution analyses and TCR sequencing, we show that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses specific for two distinct epitopes are quasi-identical in normal and GF mice. Our findings indicate that, in general, peptides derived from the intestinal microflora have little if any influence on CTL responses in the mouse.'",4
"b'A recent study conducted a factor analysis on 18 behavioural measures obtained from four alcohol-preferring and five alcohol-non-preferring rat lines/strains. It was concluded that variables such as saccharin intake, ultrasonic vocalizations following an air puff, and defaecation in an open field were associated with voluntary and forced alcohol consumption. In contrast, measures such as time immobile in the forced swim test and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze were not consistently associated with voluntary alcohol intake. The present study focuses on alcohol intake and related measures in four inbred strains of Fawn-Hooded (FH) rats that differ in voluntary alcohol intake and the ACI/N inbred rat strain, which voluntarily consumes very little alcohol. FH rats inbred by Jean Dodds (FH/Wjd) drank significantly more alcohol than FH rats inbred by Gordon Harrington (FH/Har) or selectively inbred by Abraham Provoost (FHH/Eur and FHL/EUR). In contrast, only the FH/Har strain was active in the forced swim test, suggesting that immobility and voluntary alcohol intake may be influenced by different genetic factors. The FH/Wjd rats were also much more immobile than the ACI/N rats in the forced swim test and drank almost 10 times as much alcohol voluntarily. Comparing the two parental lines with reciprocal F1 crosses revealed that alcohol consumption was influenced largely by additive genetic factors (F1 progeny had intermediate scores), whereas immobility was also influenced by dominance genetic factors (F1 progeny resembled the FH/Wjd parent). Preliminary analysis of 43 F2 progeny indicated that alcohol intake and immobility were not correlated. Thus, immobility in the forced swim test and high voluntary consumption of alcohol, two prominent features of the FH/Wjd rat strain which may be related to its serotonergic dysfunction, appear to be mediated by different genetic factors.'",0
"b'IgD is a minor component of serum Ig and the control of IgD secretion is virtually unknown. We measured concentrations of IgD (and IgE and IgM as controls) in culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 60 normal donors as well as mononuclear cells from 10 tonsils following culture in the absence or presence of CD40 mAb and cytokines. Low levels of IgD were measured in cultures of PBMC, either unstimulated or stimulated by anti-CD40 antibodies. IL-4 and IL-10 significantly increased IgD production by CD40 mAb-stimulated cells in the majority of normal subjects studied, whereas in a limited number of individuals, spontaneous IgD production was either low or high, but with no increase upon stimulation. Spontaneous IgD production by tonsil-derived mononuclear cells was higher than by PBMC and increased after CD40 stimulation and even more in the presence of IL-10, but not IL-4. IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} exerted a dose-dependent inhibition on spontaneous as well as CD40- and cytokine-induced IgD production by PBMC, but not by tonsil mononuclear cells. Activation by IL-4 of CD40-stimulated purified B cells from tonsil and PBMC, and by IL-10 of tonsil B cells increased IgD production, whereas IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} had no detectable inhibitory effect. This suggests that accessory cells indirectly regulate IgD synthesis. IgD production induced in PBMC by IL-4 or IL-10 appeared to result from an active synthesis, and correlated with an increase in the number of IgD-containing plasma cells as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and increased expression of secreted IgD transcripts. These findings suggest that IgD production by normal peripheral blood human B cells is regulated positively by Th2 cytokines and negatively by Th1 cytokines.'",4
"b'To further explore the localization of the N-deglycosylation involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\x96associated quality control system we studied HepG2 cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and its ts045 mutant, as in this system oligosaccharide release can be attributed solely to the VSV glycoprotein (G protein). We utilized the restricted intracellular migration of the mutant protein as well as dithiothreitol (DTT), low temperature, and a castanospermine (CST)-imposed glucosidase blockade to determine in which intracellular compartment deglycosylation takes place. Degradation of the VSV ts045 G protein was considerably greater at the nonpermissive than at the permissive temperature; this was reflected by a substantial increase in polymannose oligosaccharide release. Under both conditions these oligosaccharides were predominantly in the characteristic cytosolic form, which terminates in a single N-acetylglucosamine (OS-GlcNAc1); this was also the case in the presence of DTT, which retains the G protein completely in the ER. However when cells infected with the VSV mutant were examined at 15\xb0C or exposed to CST, both of which represent conditions that impair ER-to-cytosol transport, the released oligosaccharides were almost exclusively (> 95%) in the vesicular OS-GlcNAc2 form; glucosidase blockade had a similar effect on the wild-type virus. Addition of puromycin to glucosidase-inhibited cells resulted in a pronounced reduction (> 90%) in oligosaccharide release, which reflected a comparable impairment in glycoprotein biosynthesis and indicated that the OS-GlcNAc2 components originated from protein degradation rather than hydrolysis of oligosaccharide lipids. Our findings are consistent with N-deglycosylation of the VSV G protein in the ER and the subsequent transport of the released oligosaccharides to the cytosol where OS-GlcNAc2 to OS-GlcNAc1 conversion by an endo-\xdf-N-acetylglucosaminidase takes place. Studies with the ts045 G protein at the nonpermissive temperature permitted us to determine that it can be processed by Golgi endomannosidase although remaining endo H sensitive, supporting the concept that it recycles between the ER and cis-Golgi compartments.'",2
"b'A computer model was developed with decision analysis software to explore the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of alcohol abstinence maintenance with either standard counselling therapy or standard therapy plus 48 weeks of adjuvant acamprosate in detoxified alcoholic patients. Important complications of alcoholism were modelled using Markov processes, and included relapse (return to drinking), alcohol-related hepatic disease, acute and chronic pancreatitis, acute and chronic gastritis, oropharyngeal carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic psychosis, accidental death, and suicide. Probabilities of developing complications were dependent on whether the patients within the cohort remained abstinent or had relapsed. Relapse rates, probabilities, and costs for acamprosate therapy and treatment of complications were taken from published literature. The analysis was performed from the German health insurance perspective. Life expectancy and total lifetime costs (costs of initial abstinence maintenance therapy plus costs of complications) were calculated for a typical male cohort with average age of 41 years, 80% with fatty liver, 15% with cirrhosis, 22% with chronic pancreatitis, and 1% with alcoholic cardiomyopathy at baseline. Life expectancy with and without acamprosate therapy was 15.90 and 14.70 years respectively, and discounted (5% per annum) average total lifetime costs per patient were DEM 46 448 and DEM 49 549 respectively. We conclude that, despite the acquisition costs of DEM 2177, adjuvant acamprosate therapy was both clinically and economically attractive under conservative assumptions.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Research has tended to show that the gains of residential rehabilitation are short-term and cost-inefficient. This study compares the outcomes of two samples, one group staying at a non-statutory sector alcohol detoxification unit for <=7 days (short stay: SS) with a second group also admitted for detoxification but who stayed at the Unit for a further 8\x9621 days (long stay: LS). Allocation was not at random: the longer stay was either at the request of the client, referring or treatment agency itself and then had to be approved by an external funding agency. Sixty-four DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) alcohol-dependent subjects were studied. Baseline data included socio-demographic information, illicit drug use during the past 12 months, severity of alcohol dependence, alcohol problems, physical/psychological symptoms, depression and indices of quality of life. At baseline, LS subjects reported more recreational cannabis use than SS subjects. Sixty-two (97%) subjects were re-interviewed 12 weeks after baseline assessment. During follow-up, equal proportions of each group relapsed (>=21 units/7 day period for males; >=14 units/7day period for females). There was a trend for SS clients to have consumed less alcohol in total than the LS clients. The trend was towards improvement in the study measurements for the SS group, though none of the changes was significant. In the LS group, all variables tended towards a deterioration in health status. The longer stay did not appear to confer any extra benefit to the LS group. Cannabis use and illicit drug use at baseline, while commoner in the LS group, did not predict drinking or social adjustment in the follow-up period in this sample and thus could not be used to explain the lack of a better outcome in the LS group.'",0
"b""Engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) leads to the activation of tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules that ultimately determine the type and magnitude of the B lymphocyte's cellular response. The adaptor protein BLNK/SLP-65 plays a pivotal role in BCR signal transduction by coupling Syk activation to downstream elements such as Grb2, phospholipase C-{gamma}, Vav and Nck. We have generated BLNK\x96/\x96 mice to determine the physiological role of this protein in B cell development and activation. BLNK\x96/\x96 mice exhibit an incomplete block in B cell development with a severe inhibition of pro-B to pre-B cell differentiation. BLNK\x96/\x96 sIgM+ cells can develop, seed the peripheral lymphoid tissues and accumulate in numbers overtime. However, these mutant B cells failed to mature and are non-responsive to BCR cross-linking in terms of proliferation and up-regulation of activation markers such as CD69 and CD86 (B7-2). In addition, the CD5+ subset of B cells is absent. The immune response to T cell-independent antigen but not T cell-dependent antigen is also impaired. Overall, the phenotype of BLNK\x96/\x96 mice bears a striking resemblance to that of xid mice which is the murine model of human XLA that has a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase. This raises the interesting possibility that mutation in BLNK/SLP-65 may be responsible for certain human immunodeficiencies.""",4
"b'Background During 1990\x961992, 282 Chinese residents of Selangor and the Federal Territory, Malaysia with histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were interviewed about occupational history, diet, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, as were an equal number of Malaysian Chinese population controls, pair-matched to cases by age and sex.\r\n\r\nMethods Exposures to 20 kinds of workplace substances, solar and industrial heat, and cigarette smoke, were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods.\r\n\r\nResults Nasopharyngeal carcinoma was associated with occupational exposures to construction, metal and wood dusts; motor fuel and oil; paints and varnishes; certain other chemicals; industrial heat; solar heat from outdoor occupations; certain smokes; cigarette smoking; and childhood exposure to parental smoking. After adjustment for risk from diet and cigarette smoke, only wood dust (OR = 2.36; 95% CI : 1.33\x96 4.19), and industrial heat (OR = 2.21; 95% CI : 1.12\x964.33) remained clearly associated. Wood dust remained statistically significant after further adjustment for social class. No significant crude or adjusted association was found between NPC and formaldehyde (adjusted OR = 0.71; 95% CI : 0.34\x961.43).\r\n\r\nConclusions This study supports previous findings that some occupational inhalants are risk factors for NPC. The statistical effect of wood dust remained substantial after adjustment for diet, cigarette smoke, and social class. Intense industrial heat emerged as a previously unreported risk factor, statistically significant even after adjustment for diet and cigarette smoke. No association was found between NPC and formaldehyde.'",3
"b'Background A decrease in cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality can produce an increase in mortality from other causes, even cancer. This problem is called the competing risks problem.\r\n\r\nMethods A Markov chain is used to analyse the interrelation between CVD, IHD and cancer mortalities in Spanish women in 1981 and 1994. We compare the results using two models: discarding CVD and IHD mortality (the elimination model) and substituting CVD and IHD 1981 mortality rates in 1994 figures (the constant model).\r\n\r\nResults Removing mortality from CVD and IHD increases cancer mortality rates in women aged >=70, and the probability of death from cancer rises from 10.7% to 13.3%. In the second model, the use of CVD and IHD 1981 mortality rates in 1994 data yields slightly lower mortality rates and so the impact of CVD and IHD mortality changes in the period 1981 to 1994 is negligible except in elderly women.\r\n\r\nConclusions Although IHD and CVD mortality have decreased in all age groups of Spanish women from 1981 to 1994, this has not had a great impact on cancer mortality.'",3
"b'Trypanosoma cruzi was transformed with the Plasmodium yoelii gene encoding the circum-sporozoite (CS) protein, which contains the well-characterized CD8+ T cell epitope, SYVPSAEQI. In vivo and in vitro assays indicated that cells infected with the transformed T. cruzi could process and present this malaria parasite-derived class I MHC-restricted epitope. Immunization of mice with recombinant influenza and vaccinia viruses expressing the SYVPSAEQI epitope induced a large number of specific CD8+ T cells that strongly suppressed parasitemia and conferred complete protection against the acute T. cruzi lethal infection. CD8+ T cells mediated this immunity as indicated by the unrelenting parasitemia and high mortality observed in immunized mice treated with anti-CD8 antibody. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that vaccination of mice with vectors designed to induce CD8+ T cells is effective against T. cruzi infection.'",4
"b'To assess whether cognitive biases for drug-related cues are associated with subjective craving and behavioural indices of drug-seeking behaviour, as predicted by incentive models of addiction. Methods: Fifty social drinkers took part in a laboratory study in which their subjective craving and cognitive biases for alcohol cues were assessed, before they completed a progressive ratio operant task for alcohol (beer) reinforcement. Results: Social drinkers with high levels of alcohol craving at the beginning of the experiment had more pronounced attentional, approach, and evaluative biases for alcohol cues, compared with those with low craving. There were also trends for the high craving group to show greater operant responding for beer reinforcement, but the latter findings were inconclusive, and no evidence was found of associations between the operant responding and cognitive bias measures. Conclusions: The finding of a relationship between subjective craving and cognitive biases for alcohol cues is consistent with incentive models of addiction. Methodological factors may have obscured the predicted relationships between cognitive bias and operant performance, such as the use of a specific reinforcer (beer) during the operant task, while a range of alcohol-related cues were used in the cognitive bias tasks.'",0
"b'To clarify in the association between amount of ethanol consumption and serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GT) levels. Methods: GT values were measured from 195 individuals with a wide variety of well-documented ethanol consumption assessed by detailed personal interviews using a time-line follow-back technique. These included 103 heavy drinkers (90 men, 13 women) and 92 healthy volunteers (54 men, 38 women) who were either abstainers (n = 30) or moderate drinkers (n = 62). For comparisons, data were collected from GT measurements for establishing GT reference intervals from 2485 healthy volunteers including 1156 abstainers and 1329 moderate drinkers. Results: GT values in the individuals whose mean ethanol consumption exceeded 40 g of ethanol per day were significantly higher than those in the moderate drinkers with a mean consumption of 1\x9640 g/day (P < 0.001) or in abstainers (P < 0.001). The GT values in the group of moderate drinkers also exceeded those of the abstainers (P < 0.001). The upper normal GT limits obtained from the data from abstainers were markedly lower (men 45 U/l, women 35 U/l) than those obtained from the population of moderate drinkers (men 66 U/l, women 40 U/l). Conclusions: Serum GT concentrations may respond to relatively low levels of ethanol consumption, which should be considered when defining GT reference intervals. The continuous increase in alcohol consumption at population level may lead to increased GT cut-off limits and hamper the detection of alcohol problems and liver affection in their early phase.'",0
"b'Objective To estimate the completeness of the French mandatory AIDS surveillance system (D\xe9claration Obligatoire DO) over the 1990\x961993 period using a capture-recapture approach, by matching the mandatory reports with the AIDS cases present in the French Hospital Database on HIV infection (FHDH).\r\n\r\nMethods An anonymous record-linkage algorithm was developed to identify those cases common to both anonymous surveillance systems. The linkage was based on sex, date of birth, and infection risk group, all strictly matched, and on the dates of AIDS diagnosis and of death, the places of diagnosis and residence, and the AIDS-defining diseases at diagnosis. The total number of AIDS cases and completeness of both surveillance systems were estimated using a capture-recapture approach, assuming independence of the ascertainment sources.\r\n\r\nResults The completeness of the mandatory reporting was estimated at 83.6% (95% CI : 82.9\x9684.3), and that of the FHDH at 47.6% (95% CI : 46.9\x9648.3) for the surveillance of AIDS cases diagnosed among adults in France between 1990 and 1993. The completeness of the system based on FHDH increased over the study period as more hospitals joined the project, while the completeness of the DO surveillance system remained stable.\r\n\r\nConclusion This approach was useful in estimating the underreporting of AIDS cases in France. Regularly performed, it will allow the impact of underreporting to be monitored over time.'",3
"b'Mucins in ulcerative colitis and colon cancer share common properties of reduced sulfation and increased oncofetal carbohydrate antigen expression. It has previously been shown that there is no simple correlation between these changes and the activity of the relevant glycosyl-, sialyl-, and sulfo-transferases. We examined mucin sulfation and expression of oncofetal Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen (galactosyl\xdf1-3N-acetylgalactosamine{alpha}-) in the goblet cell\x96differentiated human colon cancer cell line LS174T following treatment with bafilomycin A1, which raises intra-Golgi pH, or monensin, which disrupts medial-trans Golgi transport.\r\n\r\nCells were dual-labeled with sodium [35S]-sulfate and D-[6-3H(N)]-glucosamine hydrochloride, or labeled with L-[U-14C]-threonine alone. Mucin was purified using Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration. Mucin sulfo-Lewisa and TF antigen expression were assessed using the F2 anti-sulfo-Lewisa monoclonal antibody and peanut agglutinin binding respectively.\r\n\r\nBafilomycin (0.01 \xb5M; 48 h) reduced total mucin sulfation, expressed relative to incorporation of glucosamine, to 0.50 \xb1 0.04 d.p.m. [35S]-sulfate per d.p.m. [3H]-glucosamine compared to control, 0.84 \xb1 0.05 (p < 0.001, n = 16). This was accompanied by 50.3 \xb1 8.0% increased expression of TF antigen (p < 0.01) and 50.1 \xb1 5.5% decreased expression of sulfo-Lewisa (p < 0.01). The reduced sulfate:glucosamine ratio was largely due to increased incorporation of glucosamine into newly synthesized mucin rather than reduction in total sulfate incorporation. In contrast, monensin only reduced total mucin glycosylation at concentrations > 0.1\xb5M and had no significant effect on mucin sulfation or TF expression.\r\n\r\nIntra-Golgi alkalinization affects mucin glycosylation, resulting in decreased mucin sulfation and increased expression of TF antigen, changes that mimic those seen in cancerous and premalignant human colonic epithelium.'",2
"b'During adult thymus development immature CD4\x96CD8\x96 [double-negative (DN)] precursor cells pass through four phenotypically distinct stages defined by expression of CD44 and CD25: CD44hiCD25\x96 (DN1), CD44hiCD25+ (DN2), CD44loCD25+ (DN3) and CD44loCD25- (DN4). Although it is well established that the TCR \xdf, {gamma} and {delta} genes are rearranged and expressed in association with the CD3 components in DN thymocytes, the precise timing of expression of the TCR and CD3 proteins has not been determined. In this report we have utilized a sensitive intracellular (ic) staining technique to analyze the expression of ic CD3{epsilon}, TCR \xdf and TCR {gamma}{delta} proteins in immature DN subsets. As expected from previous studies of TCR \xdf rearrangement and mRNA expression, icTCR \xdf+ cells were first detected in the DN3 subset and their proportion increased thereafter. Surprisingly, however, both icCD3{epsilon}+ and icTCR {gamma}{delta}+ cells were detected at later stages of development than was predicted by molecular studies. In particular icCD3{epsilon} protein expression coincided with the transition from the DN2 to DN3 stage of development, whereas icTCR {gamma}{delta} protein expression was only detected in a minor subset of DN4 cells. The implications of these findings for {alpha}\xdf lineage divergence will be discussed.'",4
"b'Hyponatraemia is commonly reported in chronic alcoholic patients. However, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not well delineated. In the current study, we analysed the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of hyponatraemia in a group of alcoholic patients (n = 127) admitted to our hospital for causes related to alcohol misuse. Hyponatraemia (serum sodium <134 mmol/l) was found in 22 patients (17.3%). The most common cause of hyponatraemia in our cohort was hypovolaemia (12 patients); pseudohyponatraemia was diagnosed in six patients with alcohol-induced severe hypertriglyceridaemia. It is of interest that two patients fulfilled the criteria of the so-called \x91beer potomania\x92 syndrome, while in two others, hyponatraemia was due to reset osmostat or to cerebral salt wasting syndrome, not previously described in alcoholic patients. It is concluded that hyponatraemia is a frequently observed electrolyte disorder in hospitalized alcoholic patients and is related to various pathophysiological mechanisms.'",0
"b'he aim of this study was to examine how macrophages could act on ethanol-induced oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes during inflammatory conditions, well-known to induce nitric oxide (NO) synthase. For this purpose, RAW 264.7 macrophages were added to primary rat hepatocyte cultures. Co-cultures were then supplemented with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon {gamma} (IFN) for 18 h, in order to induce NO synthase before the addition of 50 mM ethanol. In cultures of hepatocytes alone, the addition of LPS and IFN protected from ethanol-induced oxidative stress. It has been shown previously that NO generated in hepatocytes was responsible for this effect. When macrophages were added to primary rat hepatocyte cultures supplemented with LPS and IFN, protection provided by NO against ethanol-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes ceased. Using a pretreatment of macrophages with Ng-monomethyl-l-arginine, a NO synthase inhibitor, it was concluded that NO generated by macrophages was responsible for macrophage toxicity. Taken together, our observations suggest that NO biosynthesis in hepatocytes protects them from ethanol-induced oxidative stress, whereas NO production in macrophages deprives hepatocytes of this NO protection.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'on-human primates will readily consume an alcohol solution for its reinforcing effects when such a solution is palatable, with some subjects consuming alcohol to excess. In this review, we discuss variables that contribute to high alcohol consumption and the behaviours that are correlated with it in a non-human primate model. Developmental and behavioural correlates of central nervous system (CNS) serotonergic activity, as measured by concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindol-3-ylacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), were used to investigate neurogenetic influences on alcohol consumption, as well as personality traits that characterize excessive alcohol intake. Inter-individual differences in CSF 5-HIAA concentrations were shown to have trait-like qualities, and with stable inter-individual differences across time and settings. Research has shown numerous similarities between human and non-human primates with respect to Type I- and II-like alcohol abuse and their associated behaviours. In the present series of studies, features characteristic of Type I alcohol misuse, such as high levels of anxiety, hypothalamic\x96pituitary\x96adrenal output, and situational stress predicted high alcohol intake. Primates with low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations also exhibited behaviours characteristic of Type II alcohol abuse. Principal among the traits that these subjects exhibited were deficits in impulse control. For example, subjects with low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations engaged in spontaneous behaviours that bring reinforcement but placed them at risk, such as entering food baited traps, jumping from dangerous heights to get from one tree to another, and consuming large amounts of alcohol. They can be characterized by other Type II-like deficits, such as impaired social competence, social alienation, and unrestrained, violent aggression. Non-human primates with low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations also exhibited high intrinsic tolerance following modest intakes of alcohol, and high rates of aggression during intoxication. High preferences for sweet solutions were shown to predict excessive alcohol consumption. Maternal and paternal genetic influences played major roles in producing low CNS serotonin function and excessive alcohol consumption. These genetic influences on serotonin function were exacerbated by early rearing experiences, particularly parental deprivation.'",0
"b'The sugar binding specificity of the recently described mannose-specific carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBP) isolated to homogeneity from both the epimastigote and trypomastigote stages of the pathogenic protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi has been studied by quantitative hapten inhibition of the biotinylated CBPs to immobilized thyroglobulin using model oligosaccharides.\r\n\r\nThe results clearly show a differential specificity toward high-mannose glycans between the CBPs from the two developmental stages. Thus, the isolated CBP from epimastigotes exhibited stronger affinity for higher mannose oligomers containing the Man{alpha}1-2Man{alpha}1-6Man{alpha}1-6 structure. Its affinity decreased, as did the number of mannose residues on the oligomer or removal of the terminal Man{alpha}1-2-linked mannose. By contrast the CBP isolated from the trypomastigote stage showed about 400-fold lower avidity than the epimastigote form, and contrary to it, it was slightly more specific toward Man5GlcNAc than Man9GlcNAc. Analysis of the interaction of epimastigote-Man-CBP with its ligands by UV difference spectroscopy indicates the existence of an extended binding site in that protein with a large enthalpic contribution to the binding. The thermodynamic parameters of binding were obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry and been found that the {Delta}H values to be in good agreement with the van\x92t Hoff values. The binding reactions are mainly enthalpically driven and exhibit enthalpy-enthropy compensation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, analysis of the high-mannose glycans from different parts of the digestive tract of the reduviid insect vector of T. cruzi suggest a role of the CBP in the retention of the epimastigote stage in the anterior portion of the gut.'",2
"b""Objective Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly in the US. The present study assesses the possible role of a number of risk factors for postmenopausal bone fractures.\r\n\r\nMethods We analysed the relationships of anthropometric, demographic and lifestyle factors with the risk of bone fracture among 6250 postmenopausal women in a prospective cohort study, the New York University Women's Health Study.\r\n\r\nResults After an average of 7.6 years of follow-up, 1025 new incident bone fractures were reported, including 34 hip and 159 wrist fractures (incidence rates; 71.6 and 334.7 per 105 woman-years, respectively). The risk of fracture increased with increasing age, body height and total fat intake, while it was significantly lower among obese and African American women. The relative risk among African Americans was 0.45 (95% CI : 0.32\x960.63) compared with non-African Americans. Women taller than 170 cm had a 64% increase in risk of fractures, as compared with those under 155 cm. These associations were generally more pronounced when fractures were limited to those at the hip and wrist.\r\n\r\nConclusions The present study provides an indication for a potential role of dietary fat in the development of postmenopausal fractures and further evidence to support protective effects of obesity, short stature and African American ethnicity.""",3
"b'Background Low birthweight has been shown to predict behavioural problems in children. Less is known about the effect of birthweight, and how this may interact with the social environment in determining behaviour in a general population sample. We have examined the relationship between birthweight and social factors on childhood psychological well-being.\r\n\r\nMethods Cross-sectional analysis of data on 5181 children aged 4\x9615 years from a randomly selected household population, the 1997 Health Survey for England. The main outcome measures were behavioural problems as defined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in relation to birthweight and social environmental factors.\r\n\r\nResults Birthweight was a significant predictor of total difficulties score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% CI : 1.07, 1.49), hyperactivity in boys (OR = 1.25, 95% CI : 1.05, 1.51), and peer problems in girls (OR = 1.24, 95% CI : 0.99, 1.53). There was a strong social class gradient in the prevalence of behavioural problems for all birthweight tertiles. Bivariate analysis showed that high total difficulties score was significantly more common in lower birthweight tertiles for social classes III non-manual and III manual (P-value for trend 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). There were smaller, non-significant effects of birthweight on the prevalence of behavioural problems in social class I and II, and IV and V. Statistical tests for an interaction between birthweight and social class were not significant.\r\n\r\nConclusions Early life factors, such as birthweight and social class have important influences on psychological well-being in children. The birthweight effect is influenced by social factors, with the possibility that an advantaged social environment protects against the development of behavioural problems, and a disadvantaged environment increases the risk of behavioural problems, regardless of birthweight.\r\n\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\r\nBirthweight predicts behavioural problems in children: in boys birthweight is a predictor of hyperactivity, and in girls birthweight is predictive of peer problems. \r\nAdvantaged social environments protect against the development of behavioural problems, whilst disadvantaged environments increase the risk of behavioural problems. \r\nBirth outcome and the social environment exert independent and potentially interactive effects on behaviour in children.

"b'Among {alpha}3-fucosyltransferases ({alpha}3-FucTs) from most species, four cysteine residues appear to be highly conserved. Two of these cysteines are located at the N-terminus and two at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain. FucT VII possesses two additional cysteines in close proximity to each other located in the middle of the catalytic domain. We identified the disulfide bridges in a recombinant, soluble form of human FucT VII. Potential free cysteines were modified with a biotinylated alkylating reagent, disulfide bonds were reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, and the protein was digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin, before characterization by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. More than 98% of the amino acid sequence for the truncated enzyme (beginning at amino acid 53) was verified. Mass spectrometry analysis also demonstrated that both potential N-linked sites are occupied. All six cysteines in the FucT VII sequence were shown to be disulfide-linked. The pairing of the cysteines was determined by proteolytic cleavage of nonreduced protein and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that Cys68\x96Cys76, Cys211\x96Cys214, and Cys318\x96Cys321 are disulfide-linked. We have used this information, together with a method of fold recognition and homology modeling, using the ({alpha}/\xdf)8-barrel fold of Escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase as a template to propose a model for FucT VII.'",2
"b'Hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) comprises a persistent decrease in synaptic transmission which is induced by repeated low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Although LTD has been widely demonstrated in the CA1 region in vitro, very few positive reports of LTD in vivo have occurred. In this study, the conditions under which homosynaptic LTD occurs in the CA1 region of freely moving rats was investigated. Three rat strains were studied: Wistar, Sprague\x96 Dawley and Hooded Lister. Whereas Wistar and Sprague\x96Dawley rats expressed optimal LTD following 1 Hz LFS, Hooded Lister rats showed no LTD when tested in an LFS range of 1\x9610 Hz. Exposure to marked stress transiently enhanced LTD obtained in Wistar and Sprague\x96Dawley rats, but did not facilitate LTD induction in the LTD-resistant strain. It was possible to induce long-term potentiation with high-frequency stimulation, although the profile of LTP was different in each strain. These data suggest that the expression of LTD varies according to the strain of rat used and is tightly dependent upon stimulation frequency.

These data may explain, in part, the conflicting reports with regard to the inducibility of hippocampal LTD in vivo.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors of all species contain the core structure protein-CO-NH-(CH2)2-PO4-Man{alpha}1\x962Man{alpha}1\x966Man{alpha}1\x964GlcN{alpha}1\x966inositol-PO4-lipid. In recent studies in yeast it was found that gpi10-1 mutants accumulate M2, an abnormal intermediate having the structure Man{alpha}1\x966[NH2-(CH2)2-PO4->]Man{alpha}1\x964GlcN{alpha}1\x966(acyl->)inositol-PO4-lipid. It thus was realized that yeast GPI lipids, as their mammalian counterparts, contain an additional phosphorylethanolamine side chain on the {alpha}1,4-linked mannose. The biosynthetic origin of this phosphorylethanolamine group was investigated using gpi10-1 {Delta}ept1 {Delta}cpt1, a strain which is unable to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine by transferring phosphorylethanolamine from CDP-ethanolamine onto diacylglycerol, but which still can make phosphatidylethanolamine by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Gpi10-1 {Delta}ept1 {Delta}cpt1 triple mutants are unable to incorporate [3H]ethanolamine into M2 although metabolic labeling with [3H]inositol demonstrates that they make as much M2 as gpi10-1. In contrast, when labeled with [3H]serine, the triple mutant incorporates more label into M2 than gpi10-1. This result establishes that the phosphorylethanolamine group on the {alpha}1,4-linked mannose is derived from phosphatidylethanolamine and not from CDP-ethanolamine.'",2
"b""The galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferases (GSTs) are a family of Golgi-resident enzymes that transfer sulfate from 3'phosphoadenosine 5'phospho-sulfate to the 6-hydroxyl group of galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or N-acetylglucosamine in nascent glycoproteins. These sulfation modifications are functionally important in settings as diverse as cartilage structure and lymphocyte homing. To date six members of this gene family have been described in human and in mouse. We have determined the chromosomal localization of these genes as well as their genomic organization. While the broadly expressed enzymes implicated in proteoglycan biosynthesis are located on different chromosomes, the highly tissue specific enzymes GST-3 and 4 are encoded by genes located both in band q23.1\x9623.2 on chromosome 16. In the mouse, both genes reside in the syntenic region 8E1 on chromosome 8. This cross-species conserved clustering is suggestive of related functional roles for these genes. The human GST4 locus actually contains two highly similar open reading frames (ORF) that are 50 kb apart and encode two highly similar enzyme isoforms termed GST-4{alpha} and GST-4{beta}. All genes except GST0 (chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase) contain intron-less ORFs. With one exception these are fused directly to sequences encoding the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of the respective mature mRNAs. The 5' UTRs of these mRNAs are usually encoded by a number of short exons 5' of the respective ORF. 5'UTRs of the same enzyme expressed in different cell types are sometimes derived from different exons located upstream of the ORF. The genomic organization of the GSTs resembles that of certain glycosyltransferase gene families.""",2
"b'We have investigated the effect of glucocorticoids (GC) on antigen uptake molecule expression and on endocytic activity of human dendritic cells (DC). Human monocyte-derived DC were differentiated in vitro for 7 days with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and IL-4 in the presence or absence of dexamethasone 10\x968 M (Dex). Dex-treated DC showed an enhancement of mannose receptor (MR)-mediated endocytosis (measured as uptake of FITC\x96dextran) and of fluid-phase endocytosis [measured as uptake of Lucifer yellow (LY)] The effect was dose dependent and correlated with the length of exposure to Dex. The expression of receptors involved in antigen capture was investigated by FACS analysis. Dex up-regulates MR, CD16 and CD32 expression on DC. After maturation with tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} or CD40 ligand in Dex-treated DC, despite a reduction induced by maturation the endocytic activity of FITC\x96dextran and LY, the expression of MR, CD16 and CD32 remained higher than in control DC. In view of the fact that antigen capture was increased in cells cultured with Dex, we evaluated the ability to present soluble antigen that needs to be taken up and processed. Cells differentiated in the presence of Dex showed much lower efficiency in presenting tetanus toxin to specific autologous T cell lines. In conclusion our data suggest a new mechanism by which GC may influence immune responses. In fact with the increase in endocytic activity, Dex favors the scavenging of antigen from the external milieu, decreasing antigen concentration and availability, and simultaneously inhibiting the capacity to stimulate T cells.'",4
"b'Studies in cell lines and malignant human tissues have shown that increased cell-surface Asn-linked [beta]1-6(GlcNAc[beta]1-6Man) branching is associated with increased tumorigenic and metastatic properties. In this study, three mouse mammary cancer cell lines were transfected with an expression vector containing the mouse cDNA for N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAcT-V EC 2.4.1.155), the glycosyltransferase responsible for initiating [beta]1-6 branching on Asn-linked carbohydrates. The cell lines were screened for increased cytotoxicity to L-PHA, a lectin specific for [beta]1-6 branching structures. Cell lines exhibiting increased L-PHA cytotoxicity expressed increased levels of [beta]1-6 branching structures. Northern blots detected the presence of GlcNAcT-V transcribed from the expression vector in the L-PHA sensitive cell lines. After injection into the tail veins of mice, transfected cell lines with increased [beta]1-6 branching on the cell surface formed elevated levels of lung tumors relative to control transfected cell lines (P < 0.002). Western blots of membrane proteins from GlcNAcT-V transfected and control cells probed with the lectins DSA and WGA did not show an increase in polyN-acetyllactosamine and sialic acid content in the transfected cell lines. These results demonstrate that a specific increase in [beta]1-6 branching due to an elevation in GlcNAcT-V expression increases metastatic potential.'",2
"b'Sera of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently contain oligoclonal IgG autoantibodies with high affinity for the ribosomal protein L7 (rpL7). The humoral autoimmune response to rpL7 apparently is driven by antigen and T cell dependent. In order to analyze the T cell response to rpL7 we cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals and SLE patients in the presence of recombinant rpL7. After 10 days, the cytokine response to re-stimulation with rpL7 was examined using a spot-ELISA. Measuring IFN-{gamma} secretion, the T cells of two patients and four healthy donors showed a significant increase in the number of spots as compared to control cells. Secretion of IL-4 or IL-10 was not detected. From the antigen-stimulated primary cultures we established by limiting dilution cloning six rpL7-reactive, IFN-{gamma}-secreting T cell lines which show a CD3+CD4+CD8\x96 phenotype. One line additionally was shown to be positive for HLA-DR and CD45R0, but negative for CD27 and CD31. The cell lines carry {alpha}\xdf TCR chains which differ from each other in sequence and specificity. rpL7 fragments rich in basic amino acids could be identified as epitopes recognized by the TCR of three cell lines. Recognition of rpL7 is HLA-DR6 restricted or respectively HLA-DP restricted in the two cell lines analyzed.'",4
"b'The present study examined whether administration in vivo of a maximally stimulating dose of growth hormone (GH) was capable of modulating selected aspects of the GH\x96insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system to the same extent in alcohol-fed and control animals. Rats were maintained on an alcohol-containing diet for 14 weeks, while control animals were fed isocalorically. After surgical implantation of a catheter in the carotid artery, rats were starved overnight. The next morning, rats were injected with recombinant human GH (500 \xb5g/kg, s.c.) or an equal volume of saline at time 0 and 12 h. Blood samples were collected prior to GH and at 6, 12 and 24 h thereafter; tissues were collected at the end of the study. Time-matched control and alcohol-fed rats not receiving GH were also included. Although the plasma concentrations of both total and free IGF-I were decreased 30\x9640% in alcohol-fed rats, the ability of GH to elevate circulating IGF-I was not diminished. GH was equally effective at increasing IGF-I peptide levels in both liver and skeletal muscle. GH also produced comparable increases in IGF-I mRNA in muscle in both groups. Hepatic GH receptor (GHR) peptide levels were not significantly altered by either alcohol or GH. Alcohol feeding decreased plasma levels of IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and increased IGFBP-1, and GH did not significantly alter this profile. Hepatic expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS-3) mRNA was not different between the groups. However, SOCS-3 mRNA was increased by ~50% in control animals in response to GH, but remained unchanged in alcohol-fed rats. These data indicate that the decrease in hepatic IGF-I synthesis and plasma IGF-I observed in alcohol-fed rats was independent of a change in GHR levels. In contrast, the ability of a maximally stimulating dose of GH to modulate selected biological responses in vivo was not impaired by chronic alcohol consumption and was associated with a lack of a GH-induced increase in SOCS-3 mRNA.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Schizosaccharomyces pombe whole-cell glycoproteins, previously depleted of N-linked glycans by sequential treatment with endo-\xdf-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and peptide-N4-asparagine amidohydrolase F, were \xdf-eliminated with 0.1 M NaOH/1 M NaBH4 to release the O-linked oligosaccharides. The saccharide-alditols were separated by gel-exclusion chromatography into pools from Hexitol to Hex4Hexitol in size. Analysis of the Hexitol pool indicated Man to be the only sugar linked to Ser or Thr residues. The Hex1Hexitol pool contained two components, Gal[alpha]1,2Man-ol (2A) and Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (2B). The Hex2Hexitol pool contained two components, Gal[alpha]1,2Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (3A) and Man[alpha]1,2Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (3B). The two Hex3Hexitol components were Gal[alpha]1,2(Gal[alpha]1,3)Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (4A) and Man[alpha]1,2(Gal[alpha]1,3)Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (4B). The Hex4Hexitol component was found to be a single isomer with the composition of Gal[alpha]1,2(Gal[alpha]1,3)Man[alpha]1,2Man[alpha]1,2Man-ol (5AB). Surprisingly, galactobiose was not detected in any of these oligosaccharides. The gma12 (T. G. Chappell and G. Warren (1989) J. Cell Biol., 109, 2693-2707) and gth1 (T. G. Chappell personal communication) [alpha]1,2-galactosyltransferase-deficient mutants and the gma12/gth1 double mutant S.pombe strains were similarly examined. The results indicated that gma12p is solely responsible for the addition of terminal [alpha]1,2-linked Gal in compound 2A, while one or both of gma12p and gth1p are required for the [alpha]1,2-linked Gal in 4A. Both transferases are largely responsible for terminal Gal in isomer 5AB. Neither gma12 nor gth1 had any discernible effect on the structure of the large N-linked galactomannans as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, while gth1p and gma12p appear responsible for adding [alpha]1,2-linked Gal to terminal Man, neither adds galactose side chains to the N-linked poly [alpha]1,6-Man outerchain, nor the O-linked branch-forming [alpha]1,3-linked Gal. Furthermore, the presence of Hex[alpha]1,2(Gal[alpha]1,3)Man[alpha]1,2- structures in the O-linked glycans implies the presence of a novel branch-forming [alpha]1,3-galactosyltransferase in S.pombe.'",2
"b'It is common to treat some diseases with more than one medication simultaneously. Since more than one neurotransmitter system is involved in alcohol-seeking behaviour, then a therapeutic approach that targets more than one system should be more effective in reducing alcohol intake than one addressing a single system. To test this hypothesis, we compared the efficacy of low doses of individual drugs reported to reduce voluntary alcohol drinking to the efficacy of a mixture of these agents at the same low doses in reducing alcohol intake in three strains of alcohol-preferring rats (P, HAD, and Fawn-Hooded). After establishment of a stable baseline for alcohol intake in a continuous access paradigm, each rat received separate single i.p. injections of relatively low doses of either naltrexone (2.0 mg/kg), fluoxetine (1.0 mg/kg), the thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue TA-0910 (0.2 mg/kg), a mixture of all three drugs, or the vehicle at 09:30. Each rat received all treatments, with an inter-injection washout period of at least 3 days. Alcohol and water intakes were measured at 6 and 24 h, and food intake was measured at 24 h, after the injection. Our results show that individual drugs did not significantly affect food, water, or alcohol intake. However, the mixture significantly reduced alcohol intake in all three strains, but had no effect on food intake. Similar results were obtained when the HAD rats received an oral dose of the individual drugs or the mixture. When P rats were given an i.p. injection of the mixture for 10 consecutive days, there was a continued suppressing effect. These findings show that a combination treatment designed to target simultaneously serotonergic, dopaminergic, and opioidergic systems can reduce alcohol intake, even though the doses of the individual drugs in the mixture are relatively low and ineffective when given singly.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The possible effects of glucocorticoids (GC) on the biology of thymic dendritic cells (DC) have been analyzed. Both DC and GC seem to be involved in intrathymic T cell selection but possible relationships, if any, between them remain currently unknown. For the first time, we have proved the expression of GC receptors in thymic DC. Moreover, our data demonstrate that in vitro dexamethasone (Dex) treatment barely affects the viability of mature thymic DC, which are largely resistant to its apoptotic effect. Dex-treated thymic DC also show a slightly reduced surface expression of some adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules in correlation with diminished allostimulatory properties. Furthermore, the production of both IL-1\xdf and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha}, but not that of IL-6 and IL-10, diminished in the mixed leukocyte reaction established with Dex-treated thymic DC. However, the addition of recombinant rat IL-1\xdf and TNF-{alpha}, alone or in combination, did not recover the allostimulatory capacity. Taken together, these results support certain GC-mediated regulation of the activity of thymic DC which could be relevant for the biology of the thymus gland.'",4
"b'A combination of adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine (Homo) enhances tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in several tumor cells. Ado and Homo at concentrations that enhanced TNF-{alpha}-mediated cytotoxicity accumulated S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and as consequence decreased the cellular methylation state, i.e. the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to AdoHcy. This decrease led to inhibition of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (MTase), an enzyme that catalyzes carboxyl methylation of C-terminal cysteine residues on isoprenylated proteins. The effect of Ado and Homo on TNF-{alpha} cytotoxicity was at least partly mimicked by S-farnesylthioacetic acid, a selective inhibitor of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl MTase, suggesting involvement of methylations of prenylated proteins in TNF-{alpha}-mediated cytotoxicity. Blockage of methylation reactions was associated with an enhancement of the TNF-{alpha}-induced disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m). In nude mice, a combination of Ado, Homo and TNF-{alpha} led to TNF-{alpha}-induced hemorrhagic necrosis and growth inhibition of TNF-sensitive L929 tumors, whereas little effect was observed with TNF-{alpha} alone. Even more important, the TNF-resistant L929 M1 tumors were rendered TNF-sensitive by the combined action of Ado and Homo. We conclude that Ado and Homo together enhance the effectiveness of TNF-{alpha} in vitro and in vivo, results that may have therapeutic implications.'",4
"b'Background In the light of rising human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence rates amongst women in Western Europe, a multicentred, cross-sectional study was undertaken to explore the multitude of possible factors associated with HIV in a population of female injecting drug users (IDU).\r\n\r\nMethods Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1198 female IDU recruited from a variety of settings in Paris, Madrid, Rome, London and Berlin. Their HIV status was determined from antibody testing of blood or saliva samples or from written confirmation of HIV test results from a physician. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify direct and indirect associations between socioeconomic factors, marginalization and risk behaviour with HIV prevalence.\r\n\r\nResults The HIV prevalence in the sample of female IDU was 27.8% (range: 1.4% in London and 52.6% in Madrid). Factors independently associated with HIV prevalence in the regression analysis included: age >25 years (OR = 2.0\x962.9), left full-time education before age 14 (OR = 2.4), no fixed address (OR = 2.2), previous imprisonment (OR = 1.4), commercial sex (OR = 1.3), having a regular HIV positive sexual partner (OR = 6.6), ever shared needles (OR = 1.5) and any sexually transmitted disease (STD) infection in the last year (OR = 1.7).\r\n\r\nConclusions The sexual behaviour and partners of female IDU in Western Europe are as important a component in explaining the HIV epidemic in this population as other risk factors, including high-risk drug taking behaviour. Homeless IDU women may be an important residual risk group warranting future preventive interventions and women with a history of STD should be a particular target for health education. Differences in HIV prevalence across cities are very large and may be related to differences in harm reduction policies.'",3
"b'Background This study aimed to evaluate purified protein derivative (PPD) reactivity and its interrelationship with anergy panel and CD4+ lymphocytes in HIV-infected subjects as compared to PPD reactivity in HIV-uninfected individuals in a tuberculosis endemic and high Bacillus Calmette-Gu\xe9rin (BCG) coverage environment.\r\n\r\nMethods Clients of four Mexico City HIV detection centres were screened for HIV-1 antibodies (ELISA or haemagglutination, Western Blot); reactivity to PPD (Mantoux PPD, 5TU RT-23), Candida (1:1000, 0.1 ml), and tetanus toxoid (10Lf, 0.1 ml); and CD4+ T cells. Active tuberculosis was excluded. Informed consent was obtained.\r\n\r\nResults From 5130 clients 1168 subjects were enrolled; of these 801 (68.6%) were HIV positive. Reactivity to PPD among HIV-positive subjects was found in 174 (22%), 261 (32.6%), and 296 (37%), at PPD cutoff levels of >=10 mm, >=5 mm, and >=2 mm as compared to 224 (61%) of 367 HIV-negative individuals\x92 reactors to PPD (>=10 mm) (P < 0.001). After exclusion of anergic individuals using two cutoff levels for cutaneous allergens (<=2 mm and <=5 mm), PPD reactivity between HIV-infected and uninfected individuals continued to be significantly different. Only HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ T cells >=500 cells/mm3 had similar reactivity to PPD as HIV-uninfected individuals. Variables associated with PPD reactivity were CD4+ T cell counts, BCG scar, HIV infection and age.\r\n\r\nConclusions PPD reactivity was useful to diagnose tuberculosis infection only among HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ counts >=500 cells/mm3. Among individuals with lower counts, lowering cutoff levels or using anergy panel did not permit comparable reactivity as that observed among HIV-uninfected individuals.'",3
"b'On the basis of function and sequence similarities, the vertebrate fucosyltransferases can be classified into three groups: [alpha]-2-, [alpha]-3-, and [alpha]-6-fucosyltransferases. Thirty new putative fucosyltransferase genes from invertebrates and bacteria and six conserved peptide motifs have been identified in DNA and protein databanks. Two of these motifs are specific of [alpha]-3-fucosyltransferases, one is specific of [alpha]-2-fucosyltransferases, another is specific of [alpha]-6-fucosyltransferases, and two are shared by both [alpha]-2- and [alpha]-6-fucosyltranserases. Based on these data, literature data, and the phylogenetic analysis of the conserved peptide motifs, a model for the evolution offucosyltransferase genes by successive duplications, followed by divergent evolution is proposed, with either two different ancestors, one for the [alpha]-2/6-fucosyltransferases and one for the [alpha]-3-fucosyltransferases or a single common ancestor for the two families. The expected properties of such an hypothetical ancestor suggest that the plant or insect [alpha]-3-fucosyltransferases using chitobiose as acceptor might be the present forms of this ancestor, since fucosyltransferases using chitobiose as acceptor are expected to be of earlier appearance in evolution than enzymes using N-acetyllactosamine. However, an example of convergent evolution of fucosyltransferase genes is suggested for the appearance of the Lea epitopes found in plants and primates.'",2
"b""Background The aim of the present study is to describe the temporal trends in mortality rates of cervical cancer in Shandong Province, China, and to elucidate their likely explanations.\r\n\r\nMethods Three retrospective surveys of all causes of death in 1970\x961974, 1985\x961989 and 1990\x961992 in Shandong were carried out. An age-period-cohort analysis based on similar survey data from Qixia, a county in Shandong, from 1970 to 1994 was performed. A correlation analysis between prevalence of syphilis and cervical cancer mortality rates three decades later was conducted. A cross-sectional survey of risk factors for cervical cancer was conducted in 1991 in one city and 12 villages in the province.\r\n\r\nResults A marked decline in cervical cancer mortality rates was observed from 1970 to 1992 and in successive birth cohorts from 1892 to 1927, and rates remained relatively constant in subsequent birth cohorts through that of 1952. The decline in these rates was strongly correlated with a decline in positive serological tests for syphilis 32 years previously. The percentages of women with selected risk factors were lower in younger women (30\x9654 years) than in older women (55\x9669 years) in both cities and rural areas.\r\n\r\nConclusion These trends are compatible with a decrease in risk of exposure to sexually transmitted factors at an early age after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and a decline in lifetime duration of exposure to possible co-factors in successive birth cohorts who reached sexual maturity before that time.""",3
"b""MHC class II molecules are heterodimeric, polymorphic transmembrane glycoproteins physiologically expressed on cells of the immune system and pathologically expressed on the affected target cells of autoimmunity. Their function is to present processed peptides to antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. To understand the molecular mechanism of the regulation of class II genes in autoimmune target cell thyrocytes, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of DRA on untransformed, differentiated human thyroid cells following IFN-{gamma} stimulation, which is potentially relevant to the inappropriate class II expression found in Graves' disease. Data from this study show that IFN-{gamma} enhances a promoter Y box binding protein and induces an X box binding protein in untransformed thyrocytes, but not in SV-40-transfected thyrocytes. Initial characterization of the proteins has indicated that the Y box binding protein is ~132 kDa in size while the X box binding protein binds to the X2 region and is ~116 kDa. The X box binding protein may correspond to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a recently described component of the X2 box binding protein, X2BP. In addition, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1{alpha} protein (STAT1{alpha}) is also induced by IFN-{gamma} in these cells. These results further suggest that there are differences in class II gene regulation between differentiated cells and transformed cell lines.""",4
"b""The marked regional variation in the prevalence of asthma and other atopic diseases,1,2 together with increases in the prevalence of asthma over time (e.g.3), strongly imply that environmental factors are important in the aetiology of allergic disease.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology Stewart et al.4 have investigated the observed geographical heterogeneity to gain insights into the aetiology of these diseases. They used data on the prevalence of reported wheeze, symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis and symptoms of eczema among school-age children in 155 centres in 56 countries. Their most consistent finding was that the prevalence of each of these symptoms was lower in the countries in the lowest quartile of the distribution of per capita gross national product (GNP) than in the remaining countries.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of this investigation include the use of data collected from five continents spanning a wide range of environmental and socioeconomic conditions. Although many local investigators were involved, the steering committee went to great lengths to standardize the study methods, including the use of a videotaped depiction of wheezing in an attempt to overcome cultural and linguistic variation in the description of this symptom. The use of ecological analysis may reveal associations which are not apparent in studies of relatively homogeneous populations of individuals in single communities.5 However, there are limitations to the interpretation of these data. The information on the exposure of interest, per capita GNP, is only available at a national level, whereas the prevalence data are based on the study of one or more communities within each of the 56 countries. These communities may not be representative of the country as a whole. This is particularly the case in countries in economic transition where urban-rural and other regional differences may be extreme.\r\n\r\nHigh per capita income cannot directly cause atopic disease. The findings of this analysis, which are broadly consistent with other, more limited comparisons of atopic disease prevalence between economically disparate, but geographically and ethnically close, communities (e.g.6,7), should lead to the exposition of hypotheses about the origins of this variation. What is it about living in poorer countries that protects against the expression of atopic disease? Or conversely, what are people who live in countries with higher per capita GNP exposed to which causes atopic disease? Expressing the problem in this way highlights the difficulty in solving it. There are so many differences between these countries. However, some factors have biological plausibility and/or are supported by cross-sectional and cohort studies conducted in individuals. These include diet and obesity, allergen exposures in the home environment, and infections in early childhood.\r\n\r\nSome features of nutrition and diet have been linked to asthma and atopic disorders. Reduced in utero nutrition, manifest as a lower birthweight or lower ponderal index (birthweight in proportion to birth length), has been shown to be protective against asthma and eczema.8,9 The biological mechanism underlying this association remains unknown. While this hypothesis would be consistent with the observed reduced risk of atopic disease in low GNP countries, other proposed dietary risk factors such as lack of fish intake10 are not consistent with the observed ecological association.\r\n\r\nThe extent of early life exposure to inhalant allergens influences the subsequent acquisition of sensitization to those allergens.11 However, it remains unclear to what extent the presence of any atopy, as opposed to specific sensitization, is explained by the level of allergen exposure. Furthermore, it is unlikely that there is any strong relation between national wealth and the level of domestic allergen exposure.\r\n\r\nThe relation between childhood infections and subsequent atopy and asthma is complex. Parents of schoolchildren with asthma recall that their children had respiratory infections in infancy more commonly than other parents. However, this is likely to represent recall and unmasking bias12 rather than an aetiological association. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that respiratory and non-respiratory viral infections and other systemic infections in early life may actually protect against the development of atopy.13\x9616 The observation that children who are born into large sibships17 or who attend child care centres from an early age18 are relatively protected against the development of atopy is consistent with this hypothesis. It may also be consistent with the finding that children who live on farms with livestock in early life are less likely to develop atopy.19 The proposed mechanism for this protective effect of early life infections is immune deviation: infectious agents induce the establishment of clones of antigen-specific memory T lymphocytes which secrete anti-allergic cytokines.20 It is at least plausible that children living in countries with low per capita GNP are exposed to more of these atopy-protecting infections than children in wealthier countries.\r\n\r\nStewart et al.'s observations pose a challenge. No-one would wish to solve the problem of allergic disease by reducing national wealth. The challenge is to identify what consequence of increased national wealth increases the risk of expression of allergic disease and to establish whether this can be modified while retaining the other economic, social and health benefits of national development.""",3
"b""Immunization of BALB/c mice with peptide HVSGHRMAWDMMMNWA, encompassing residues 121\x96135 from hepatitis C virus E1 protein, induced CD4+ Th1 cells as well as a long-lasting CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in vivo when the peptide was administered s.c. with or without incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Using truncated peptides from this sequence it was shown that the determinant recognized by cytotoxic T cells was encompassed by residues SGHRMAWDM. Deletion of residues from the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the wild-type peptide abrogated its helper character. When Val122 of the wild peptide was replaced by Ala, the ability to induce a cytotoxic response was lost concomitantly with the loss of the Th1 pattern of cytokine production. Interestingly, the Ala-modified peptide, when co-immunized with a peptide encompassing residues 323\x96329 from ovalbumin (OVA), which is able to induce a Th1 response in BALB/c mice, restored the capacity of the modified peptide to induce CTL. However, co-immunization of the Ala-modified peptide with a peptide encompassing residues 106\x96118 from sperm whale myoglobin, which induces a Th0 cytokine profile in BALB/c mice, was much less efficient than the OVA peptide to restore CTL induction. These results demonstrate that CTL induction with a short synthetic peptide requires that this peptide contains domains recognized by Tc cells as well as by Th1 cells. For those peptides that do not contain this type of Th domain, competent T cell help can be provided by co-immunization with a distinct peptide that is able to stimulate a Th1 response""",4
"b""The high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc{epsilon}RI) and the low-affinity IgG receptor (Fc{gamma}RIII) on mast cells are the key molecules involved in triggering the allergic reaction. These receptors share the common \xdf subunit (FcR\xdf) which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and transduces the signals of these receptors' aggregation. In rodents, FcR\xdf is essential for the cell surface expression of the Fc{epsilon}RI. In humans, the FcR\xdf gene was reported to be one of the candidate genes causing atopic diseases. However, the role of FcR\xdf in vivo still remains ambiguous. To elucidate the functions of FcR\xdf, we developed the mice lacking FcR\xdf [FcR\xdf(\x96/\x96)]. The FcR\xdf(\x96/\x96) mice lacked the expression of the Fc{epsilon}RI on mast cells and IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) was not induced in FcR\xdf(\x96/\x96) mice as was expected. In these mice, the expression of IgG receptors on mast cells was augmented but the IgG-mediated PCA reaction was attenuated. Although with bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells from FcR\xdf(\x96/\x96), adhesion to fibronectin and Ca2+ flux upon aggregation of IgG receptors were enhanced, mast cells co-cultured with 3T3 fibroblasts exhibited impaired degranulation on receptor aggregation. These observations indicate that FcR\xdf accelerates the degranulation of mature mast cells via the IgG receptor in connective tissues.""",4

Macaque area 7a neurons were tested with optic flows with speeds of 0.5\x96128\xb0/s. Of 161 neurons tested in four hemispheres of two adult male macaques, 53% (86/161) were speed selective at either the time of stimulus onset, at the end of the trial, or at both times. Speed selec- tivities resembling the basic filter types (band-pass, band-reject, high-pass, low-pass, broadband) were found. Area 7a neurons exhibited two novel properties not previously reported elsewhere. Speed selectivity was found to be dynamic in that many cells gained, lost or changed speed tuning over the course of a trial. In addition, speed dependence and optic flow selectivity interacted. For example, a cell could preferentially respond to one type of naviga- tional optic flow at a slow speed and a different navigational optic flow at a fast speed. The presence of speed selectivity combined with other properties of area 7a neurons indicates that these neurons may have a role in the concurrent representation of heading as well as multiple object speeds and directions.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Sialyltransferase activity has traditionally been studied by determining the rate at which the enzyme transfers a labeled donor sugar to an acceptor substrate. These types of assays can be difficult to quantitate, and the separation of untransfered donor sugar from the sialylated acceptor is time-consuming. The biosensor-based method described here is both rapid and semi-automated. The NeuAc-{alpha}2-6Gal-R-specific lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) immobilized to the carboxymethyl dextran surface of a BIAcore sensor chip was used to detect and measure the formation of the NeuAc-{alpha}2-6Gal-R moieties. The sialyltransferase assays were carried out using modified protocols based on the method described in Rearick, J.I., Sadler, J.E., Paulson, J.C., and Hill, R.L. (1979) Enzymatic characterization of \xdfD-galactoside {alpha}2-3 sialyltransferase from porcine submaxillary gland. J. Biol. Chem., 254, 4444\x964451. The complete assay mixture was simply diluted before injection into the instrument. All injections were performed automatically using the robotics of the BIAcore instrument. Using this technique it is possible to detect product from 0.4 \xb5U of commercial Gal\xdf1-4GlcNAc {alpha}2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) (ST6Gal I). One unit of sialyltransferase is defined as the quantity that will transfer 1 \xb5mol of N-acetylneuraminic acid from cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminic acid to asialofetuin per min at pH 6.5 and 37\xb0C. The method described here requires as little as 10 \xb5l total assay volume, thus reducing the consumption of reagents. In addition, the sample is completely recoverable from the sensor chip surface, which allows for downstream analysis of the reaction product if desired. This method eliminates the need for labeled donor and acceptor molecules and does not require the separation of the substrates from the product before analysis. Although some kinetic properties of the enzyme can be estimated using this method, further development and validation is required. The method is most useful in determining qualitative estimates of ST6Gal I activity in tissue extracts and in characterizing the production of enzymes in cultured cell systems. The use of a microtiter plate assay format enables the rapid screening of multiple fractions for sialyltransferase activity.'",2
"b""The purpose of the present investigation was to describe spatiotemporal brain activation profiles during word reading using magnetic source imaging (MSI). Ten right-handed dyslexic children with severe phonological decoding problems and eight age-matched non-impaired readers were tested in two recognition tasks, one involving spoken and the other printed words. Dyslexic children's activation profiles during the printed word recognition task consistently featured activation of the left basal temporal cortices followed by activation of the right temporoparietal areas (including the angular gyrus). Non-impaired readers showed predominant activation of left basal followed by left temporoparietal activation. In addition, we were able to rule out the hypothesis that hypoactivation of left temporoparietal areas in dyslexics was due to a more general cerebral dysfunction in these areas. Rather, it seems likely that reading difficulties in developmental dyslexia are associated with an aberrant pattern of functional connectivity between brain areas normally involved in reading, namely ventral visual association cortex and temporoparietal areas in the left hemisphere. The interindividual consistency of activation profiles characteristic of children with dyslexia underlines the potential utility of this technique for examining neurophysiological changes in response to specific educational intervention approaches.""",1

"b'Cobra venom factor (CVF), a nontoxic, complement-activating glycoprotein in cobra venom, is a functional analog of mammalian complement component C3b. The carbohydrate moiety of CVF consists exclusively of N-linked oligosaccharides with terminal {alpha}1-3-linked galactosyl residues, which are antigenic in human. CVF has potential for several medical applications, including targeted cell killing and complement depletion. Here, we report a detailed structural analysis of the oligosaccharides of CVF. The structures of the oligosaccharides were determined by lectin affinity chromatography, antibody affinity blotting, compositional and methylation analyses, and high-resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Approximately 80% of the oligosaccharides are diantennary complex-type, ~12% are tri- and tetra-antennary complex-type, and ~8% are oligomannose type structures. The majority of the complex-type oligosaccharides terminate in Gal{alpha}1-3Gal\xdf1-4(Fuc{alpha}1-3)GlcNAc\xdf1, a unique carbohydrate structural feature abundantly present in the glycoproteins of cobra venom.'",2
"b'The {alpha}1,6 fucosyltransferase ({alpha}1,6 FucT) catalyzes the transfer of a fucose from GDP-fucose to the innermost GlcNAc residue of N-linked glycans via an {alpha}1,6 linkage. {alpha}1,6 FucT was overexpressed in transgenic mice under the control of a combined cytomegalovirus and chicken \xdf-actin promoter. Histologically numerous small vacuoles, in which lipid droplets had accumulated, were observed in hepatocytes and proximal renal tubular cells. Electron microscopic studies showed that the lipid droplets were membrane-bound and apparently localized within the lysosomes. Cholesterol esters and triglycerides were significantly increased in liver and kidney of the transgenic mice. Liver lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity was significantly lower in the transgenic mice compared to the wild mice, whereas LAL protein level, which was detected immunochemically, was increased, indicating that the specific activity of LAL was much lower in the transgenic mice. In all of the transgenic and nontransgenic mice examined, the activity of liver LAL was negatively correlated with the level of {alpha}1,6 FucT activity. As evidenced by lectin and immunoblot analysis, LAL was found to be more fucosylated in the transgenic mice, suggesting that the aberrant fucosylation of LAL causes an accumulation of inactive LAL in the lysosomes. Such an accumulation of inactive LAL could be a likely cause for a steatosis in the lysosomes of the liver and kidney in the case of the {alpha}1,6 FucT transgenic mice'",2
"b'Cortical neurons are generated within the proliferative layer and follow a strict \x91inside-out\x92 gradient of migration and positioning, which determines the characteristic layering and pattern of neural connections in the adult cerebral cortex. Thus, directional migration of postmitotic neuroblasts towards layer I and regulation of the radial glia phenotype subserving cortical migration are central issues in corticogenesis. Recent studies showing that the gene disrupted in the reeler mutation \x96 reelin \x96 is expressed in Cajal\x96Retzius cells have indicated a role for these pioneer neurons in cortical migration. We show here that ablation of Cajal\x96Retzius cells in layer I by local application of domoic acid in newborn mice arrests migration of the late-generated neurons, destined to cortical layers II\x96III, that have been labeled by 5-bromodeoxyuridine injections administered at E16. In addition, degeneration of Cajal\x96Retzius cells in newborn mice dramatically decreases the number of radial glial apical processes identified by nestin-immunostaining, but increases the number of maturing glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. These findings support an essential role for Cajal\x96Retzius cells in neuronal migration and corticogenesis, by regulating the identity and function of radial glia and the radial glia-to-astrocyte transformation.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are anatomically and functionally interconnected, and have been implicated in working memory and the preparation for behavioral action. To substantiate those functions at the neuronal level, we designed a visuomotor task that dissociated the perceptual and executive aspects of the perception\x96action cycle in both space and time. In that task, the trial-initiating cue (a color) indicated with different degrees of certainty the direction of the correct manual response 12 s later. We recorded extracellular activity from 258 prefrontal and 223 parietal units in two monkeys performing the task. In the DPFC, some units (memory cells) were attuned to the color of the cue, independent of the response-direction it connoted. Their discharge tended to diminish in the course of the delay between cue and response. In contrast, few color-related units were found in PPC, and these did not show decreasing patterns of delay activity. Other units in both cortices (set cells) were attuned to response-direction and tended to accelerate their firing in anticipation of the response and in proportion to the predictability of its direction. A third group of units was related to the determinacy of the act; their firing was attuned to the certainty with which the animal could predict the correct response, whatever its direction. Cells of the three types were found closely intermingled histologically. These findings further support and define the role of DPFC in executive functions and in the temporal closure of the perception\x96 action cycle. The findings also agree with the involvement of PPC in spatial aspects of visuomotor behavior, and add a temporal integrative dimension to that involvement. Together, the results provide physiological evidence for the role of a prefrontal\x96parietal network in the integration of perception with action across time.'",1
"b'Human CD137 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and the homologue of murine 4-1BB. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD137 promotes accessory T cell activation, and regulates proliferation and survival of T lymphocytes. This study reports on the expression and function of CD137 in peripheral blood monocytes. While monocytes showed constitutive expression in 10 out of 18 healthy donors, CD137 was not expressed on resting T or B lymphocytes. Immobilized antibodies to CD137 markedly induced the production of IL-8 and TNF-{alpha} protein and mRNA, and led to inhibition of IL-10 expression by primary monocytes. Furthermore, cross-linking of CD137 on monocytes resulted in an increase of B lymphocyte apoptosis mediated by direct cell\x96cell contact of both cell populations. In conclusion, this study identified CD137 as a new receptor involved in monocyte activation by inducing a characteristic cytokine release profile. In addition, CD137 may play a role in monocyte-dependent control of B lymphocyte survival.'",4
"b'A considerable literature, clinical and experimental, has demonstrated the aggression-eliciting effects of alcohol intoxication. However, the focus of the experimental literature has been primarily on men and the studies on women have been inconclusive. This study was conducted to test for possible gender differences in the manifestation of alcohol-induced aggression. Participants were 54 males and 60 females, aged 18\x9630 years, who competed in a competitive aggression paradigm either sober or intoxicated. As expected, intoxicated men were more aggressive than their sober peers. However, under high provocation, both sober and intoxicated, women manifested aggression comparable to the intoxicated men. This study suggests that women can be as aggressive as men, and that alcohol intoxication does not seem to be as important a determining factor.'",0
"b'The redistribution of neuronal activity across rat barrel cortex following an alteration in whisker usage has been investigated. In adult rats, two mystacial vibrissae \x96 D2 and one neighbor, D1 or D3 \x96 were left intact while all other vibrissae on that side of the snout were clipped. Neurons in contralateral barrel cortex were sampled with a microelectrode array 3.5 days later. Stimulation of clipped vibrissae produced a narrow spatial distribution of cortical activity, whereas stimulation of intact vibrissae produced a widened spatial distribution. Simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical barrel-columns suggest that changes in the effective connectivity between barrel-columns may partially account for this redistribution of sensory responses. Evidence is also presented for a second mechanism, a release from inhibition in sensory-deprived cortical areas. A model is therefore proposed where these two mechanisms operate together to regulate the cortical distribution of evoked activity.'",1
"b'Objective To study the relative importance of various determinants of total and cause-specific infant and early childhood mortality rates and their decline in The Netherlands in the period 1875\x961879 to 1895\x961899.\r\n\r\nData and Methods Mortality and population data were derived from Statistics Netherlands for 16 towns and 11 rural areas. Mortality levels and their decline were estimated with a Poisson regression model. The associations of the estimated levels and declines, and determinants of infant and early childhood mortality were analysed using multivariate linear regression analysis. The causes of death studied were major contributors to infant mortality (convulsions, acute digestive disease, acute respiratory disease) and early childhood mortality (encephalitis/meningitis, acute respiratory disease, measles).\r\n\r\nResults Infant mortality rates were high in the south-western part of The Netherlands in 1875\x961879. Due to a rapid decline in the western regions, this pattern changed to a north-south gradient in 1895\x961899. Early childhood mortality showed an urban-rural gradient in 1875\x961879 with mortality high in towns. This gradient had largely disappeared by1895\x961899, due to a rapid decline in mortality in towns. Roman Catholicism was significantly associated with infant mortality (particularly from diarrhoeal disease) in 1875\x961879 and 1895\x961899. The association with Roman Catholicism was stronger in 1895\x961899 because mortality declines were less rapid in Roman Catholic areas in 1875\x961879 to 1895\x961899. Urbanization was significantly associated with early childhood mortality (particularly from respiratory disease) in 1875\x961879 and 1895\x961899. This association weakened over time, due to the rapid decline in mortality in towns.\r\n\r\nConclusions Different determinants of mortality (decline) were important in infant and early childhood mortality and they acted on different causes of death. Therefore, infant and childhood mortality should be studied separately. International comparison of the results showed that findings with respect to determinants of mortality (decline) for one country do not necessarily apply to other countries. The results for The Netherlands with respect to infant mortality differed from England and Wales.'",3
"b'This study tested anticipated affect as a potential strategy for reducing risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD). The hypothesis was that asking respondents to focus on their anticipated affect following RSOD would lead to higher ratings of negative affect than those obtained when asking respondents to focus on their feelings towards RSOD. In turn, these negative affect ratings were hypothesized as leading to safer behavioural estimates and reductions in RSOD. The study is based on a self-report questionnaire administered at two time points. At Time 1, measures of past drinking and demographic information were collected, along with affect ratings of drinking within safer single-occasion limits and affect ratings of RSOD (within-subjects condition). Time perspective was manipulated whereby the experimental group was asked to focus on affective reactions after RSOD and the control group to focus on affective reactions towards RSOD (between-subjects condition). Two weeks later, drinking behaviour was measured. The findings showed that the time perspective manipulation resulted in significantly higher negative affect ratings in the feeling after condition than in the feeling towards condition. Further, females reported lower negative affect than males. No other main or interaction effects were found. The time perspective manipulation, however, failed to produce safer behavioural estimates and RSOD reduction at follow-up. No significant differences were found between ratings of negative affect when drinking within safe limits as compared with ratings of affect when drinking above such limits. Despite greater negative affect \x91after\x92 rather than \x91toward\x92 the target behaviour, anticipated affect following RSOD did not yield safer behavioural estimates and subsequent drinking reduction at follow-up. These findings are interpreted in the context of risk perception associated with RSOD. The implications of this study for design of interventions aimed at reducing RSOD are discussed. In particular, ways of intensifying negative affect for RSOD are considered.'",0
"b""Since its discovery almost 30 years ago, the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been characterized in the USA, as a major threat to public health. In part because FAS resonated with broader social concerns in the 1970s and 1980s about alcohol's deleterious effect on American society and about a perceived increase in child abuse and neglect, it quickly achieved prominence as a social problem. In this paper, we demonstrate that, as concern about this social problem escalated beyond the level warranted by the existing evidence, FAS took on the status of a moral panic. Through examples taken from both the biomedical literature and the media about drinking during pregnancy, we illustrate the evolution of this development, and we describe its implications, particularly how it has contributed to a vapid public policy response.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b""Schistosomal egg N-glycans are the only examples in nature that have been structurally shown to contain \xdf2-xylosylation, {alpha}6-fucosylation, and {alpha}3-fucosylation on the N,N'-diacetyl chitobiose core. We present evidence that core difucosylated and xylosylated N-glycans are characteristics of Schistosoma japonicum eggs but not of the cercariae and adults, for which neither core xylosylation nor {alpha}3-fucosylation could be readily detected. In contrast, a majority of the N-glycans from Schistosoma mansoni cercariae but not the adults are core xylosylated. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis coupled with chromatographic mapping, sequential exoglycosidase digestion, and methylation analysis were employed to unambiguously define the structures of core \xdf2-xylosylated, {alpha}6-fucosylated N-glycans from S. mansoni cercariae. Unexpectedly, a majority of these N-glycans were found to carry Lewis X determinant, Gal\xdf1->4(Fuc{alpha}1->3)GlcNAc\xdf1->, on the nonreducing termini of mono- and biantennary structures. The Lewis X\x96containing glycoproteins were found to be distinct from those carrying the complex, multifucosylated glycocalyx O-glycans reported previously. The corresponding N-glycans from S. japonicum cercariae are likewise dominated by Lewis X termini but without the core xylosylation. We concluded that the invading cercariae present an important and abundant source of Lewis X antigens, which may contribute to the induced humoral response upon infection. Following transformation and development into the adults, the N-glycans synthesized comprise a significantly larger amount of high mannose and fucosylated pauci-mannose structures in comparison with the cercarial N-glycans. A portion of the mono- and biantennary complex types were identified to carry Lewis X and fucosylated LacdiNAc termini, which could also be detected by mass spectrometry analysis on larger, complex-type structures""",2
"b'Murine NKT cells can recognize {alpha}-galactosylceramide ({alpha}-GalCer) in the context of a class Ib CD1d molecule.

"b'T cell-mediated cytotoxicity can be triggered by cross-linking of TCR or Thy-1 surface proteins. While the TCR-triggered signaling initiates both perforin- and Fas ligand (FasL)\x96Fas-mediated mechanisms of cytotoxicity, it was not clear which mechanism was utilized by Thy-1-triggered signals and which pathway of cytotoxicity was triggered at low levels of antigen expression. It is shown that glycophosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein Thy-1 preferentially activates FasL\x96Fas- but not perforin-mediated cytotoxicity. This is explained by the lesser intensity of Thy-1-mediated signaling in T cells. The data suggest that Thy-1-triggered Fas-mediated cytotoxicity is completely dependent on cross-talk between Thy-1 and TCR signals since mutations in TCR\x96CD3 complex molecules or inhibition of tyrosine kinases or calcineurin abolished or strongly inhibited Thy-1-triggered FasL\x96Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. Lower concentrations of antigenic peptide or levels of cross-linking with anti-TCR\x96CD3 mAb are required to trigger Fas-mediated than perforin-mediated cytotoxicity by different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines and clones, and it is shown that cross-linking of Thy-1 is much less efficient in triggering accumulation of second messengers (intracellular Ca2+) than cross-linking of TCR on CTL. Taken together, these data reflect the possibility of differential activation of FasL and/or perforin pathways of cytotoxicity depending on the nature of activating stimuli and surface receptor.'",4
"b""To determine if general practitioners' (GPs) experience of education on alcohol, support in their working environment for intervening with alcohol problems, and their attitudes have an impact on the number of patients they manage with alcohol problems.

"b'Morphological and electrophysiological studies were performed on neocortices of adult Connexin 32 (Cx32)-deficient mice and wild-type mice to investigate the consequences of a lack of the gap junction subunit Cx32 on neocortical structure and function. Morphometrical analysis revealed a reduced volume fraction of myelin within the neuropil and a decreased thickness of the axonal myelin sheaths in the neocortex of Cx32-deficient mice. Intracellular recordings from neurons in neocortical slice preparations provided evidence for an increased membrane input resistance in neurons of Cx32-null mutant mice as compared to neurons of wild-type mice. Consequently, neurons of Cx32-deficient mice displayed an enhanced intrinsic excitability. In addition, ~50% of the neurons investigated in slices of Cx32-deficient mice responded to afferent stimulation with delayed and large glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials resembling paroxysmal depolarizations. GABAergic inhibition sufficient to efficiently control synaptic excitability was virtually absent in these cells. The changes in intrinsic membrane properties observed in neurons of Cx32-null mutant mice were independent of the alterations in synaptic function, since increased membrane resistances were observed also in neurons with normal synaptic response pattern. Thus, in the neocortex, lack of Cx32 correlates with myelination defects, alterations in intrinsic membrane properties and dysfunction of inhibitory synaptic transmission.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Many syndromes associated with mental retardation (MR) are characterized by cortical dendritic anomalies. Despite their morphological similarity, these changes appear to involve different stages of dendritic development. The neuronal cytoskeleton, which includes microfilaments, neurofilaments and microtubules, is essential for these developmental processes. Levels and phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which stabilize microtubules, seem to determine different stages of dendritic formation with certain MAPs (e.g. MAP-2) appearing to mediate the effects of external modulators upon these processes. Early studies on neuronal cytoskeleton in MR, which have shown a selective reduction in MAP-2 expression, have focused on Rett syndrome (RS). Here, by a semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the pericentral cortex, we examine the contribution of specific neuronal populations to these changes in cytoskeletal proteins. Decreased MAP-2 staining in RS was more marked in layers V\x96VI, while increased nonphosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactivity was found in layers II\x96III in RS. Age-related increases in dendritic MAP-2 immunoreactivity in layers V\x96VI were also absent in RS. The specificity of these cytoskeletal protein changes, their significance for RS pathogenesis and plasticity, as well as their implications for other MR-associated disorders, are also discussed.'",1
"b'The influence of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii on macrophage expression of co-stimulatory molecules was studied. Unlike surface expression of CD80/B7-1, that of CD86/B7-2 is increased in mouse peritoneal macrophages 24 h following exposure to live toxoplasma in vitro. Most CD86 molecules are found on infected cells bearing a maximum parasite load. Consistent with the elevated membrane expression, the quantity of CD86 gene transcript is increased in macrophages infected by T. gondii in vitro or in vivo. CD86 up-regulation contributes to the augmented capacity of parasitized macrophages to present antigen to tuberculin-specific CD4+ T cells as demonstrated by blocking CD86 ligand interaction. T. gondii triggers up-regulation of CD86 in macrophages from BALB/c mice which are resistant to the development of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Infection of macrophages from the susceptible strain BALB.B, however, results in a decreased surface expression of CD86, although the parasite load and intracellular proliferation proved comparable in both macrophages. This differential host cell reaction correlates with disparate profiles in T. gondii-induced cytokine secretion. Upon challenge with toxoplasma, IL-1{alpha} and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} are released to a significantly higher extent by BALB/c than by BALB.B macrophages, whereas the latter secrete more IL-12 and IL-10. In BALB.B macrophages, T. gondii-induced IL-10 down-regulates surface expression of CD86, thus indicating an interference of parasite-dependent cytokine release and modulation of CD86. The biased secretory response in macrophages from the two congenic strains implies an MHC-dependent and dichotomous monokine induction by T. gondii. Up-regulation of CD86 seems to occur along the IL-1/TNF-inducing pathway and experimental evidence indicates that this enhances T cell activation by parasitized macrophages.'",4
"b'We have studied the contribution of c-Fos/activator protein-1 (AP-1) to antigen-specific T cell response with reference to T cell anergy by increasing c-Fos/AP-1 in vivo and in vitro. First, after injection of a high dose of staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), clonal deletion of SEB-reactive V\xdf8+ CD4 T cells occurred both in control B6 and H2-c-fos transgenic (fos) mice, whereas proliferation of T cells against SEB was profoundly depressed in B6 but not in fos mice. Second, the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific CD4 Th1 cell clone produced decreasing amounts of IL-2 in response to increasing amounts of concanavalin A (Con A) in vitro, whereas the decrease was less significant in the Th1 clones stably transfected with c-fos gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear protein from the transformants showed that overexpression of the c-fos gene compensated the amounts of AP-1 in the nuclei of Con A-treated Th1 clones. Thus, increased c-Fos/AP-1 confers resistance against anergy induction on antigen-specific T cells.'",4
"b'One of the main limitations of using synthetic peptides for immunotherapy in allergic patients is the difficulty to delineate the immunodominant T cell epitopes which are necessarily dependent on HLA molecules. We have thus addressed the question of the role of MHC II molecules in immunodominant epitopes selection in the particular case of the major bee venom allergen (API m1). To exhaustively and easily explore it, we used BALB/c mice whose H-2 haplotype is associated with high IgE and IgG responses to API m1. By means of extensive sets of synthetic peptides, we investigated the specificity of polyclonal T cells and monoclonal hybridomas from mice immunized with API m1 and delineated four immunodominant regions, restricted to either the I-Ed or the I-Ad molecule. All the peptides were also tested for their capacity to bind to immunopurified MHC II molecules. Eight determinants of high affinity were identified. They clustered into three distinct regions and were largely overlapping. They included all the immunodominant epitopes, but half of them were not capable of stimulating T cells. Strikingly, interacting surfaces with either the TCR or MHC II molecule greatly differed from one determinant to another. In one case, we observed that flanking regions exerted a particular action on T cell stimulation which prevented the fine epitope localization. Our results underline the diversity and complexity of MHC II-restricted determinants and T cell epitopes from the major bee venom allergen, even in a single haplotype. These data also participate in the development of alternative approaches to conventional immunotherapy.'",4
"b'The neonatal immune response is impaired during the first weeks after birth. To obtain a better understanding of this immaturity, we investigated the development of T cell interactions with B cells in mice. For this purpose, we analyzed the immune response to three T-dependent antigens in vivo: (i) the polyclonal antibody response induced by vaccinia virus; (ii) the production of polyclonal and specific antibodies following immunization with hapten\x96carrier conjugates; (iii) the mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen (sAg) response involving an increase in sAg-reactive T cells and induction of polyclonal antibody production. After vaccinia virus injection into neonates, the polyclonal antibody response was similar to that observed in adult mice. The antibody response to hapten\x96carrier conjugates, however, was delayed and reduced. Injection with sAg-expressing B cells from neonatal or adult mice allowed us to determine whether B cells, T cells or both were implicated in the reduced immune response. In these sAg responses, neonatal T cells were stimulated by both neonatal and adult sAg-presenting B cells but only B cells from adult mice differentiated into IgM- and IgG-secreting plasma cells in the neonatal environment in vivo. Injecting neonatal B cells into adult mice did not induce antibody production. These results demonstrate that the environment of the neonatal lymph node is able to support a T and B cell response, and that immaturity of B cells plays a key role in the reduced immune response observed in the neonate.'",4
"b'To assess the accuracy and performance of AUDIT in detecting alcohol problems, as defined by ICD-10 and DSM-IV, in a rural district in Vietnam. Methods: The study was conducted in a rural district of Vietnam. Five hundred men and women aged 18\x9660 were randomly selected for interview with AUDIT and CIDI 2.1. The ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for harmful use/alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence were used to evaluate AUDIT. Results: Due to few cases of alcohol problems observed among women (1/282), we could only evaluate the validity of AUDIT in men. At cut-off point 7/8, AUDIT had a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 76.1% for detecting at-risk drinking. At this cut-off point, using ICD-10 criteria, the sensitivity was 100% for harmful use and 93.8% for alcohol dependence; the specificity was 69.9% for harmful use and 87.4% for alcohol dependence. The area under the ROC curve was 0.91 (0.84\x960.98) for harmful use and 0.84 (0.74\x960.94) for alcohol dependence (ICD-10). The agreement between ICD-10 and DSM-IV was higher for diagnosing alcohol dependence than alcohol abuse (Kappa coefficient: 0.98 vs 0.68). Conclusion: We confirmed that AUDIT is feasible to use in a rural community in a developing country. Different cut-off points are appropriate for different purposes, but for general population screening of at-risk drinking we found a cut-off point 7/8 to be optimal.'",0
"b'The medical/research records of 1014 patients diagnosed at the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Diagnostic and Prevention Network (DPN) of clinics were used to develop a new, comprehensive, reproducible method for diagnosing the full spectrum of outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. This new diagnostic method, called the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, was compared to the standard gestalt method of diagnosis on the first 454 patients who had received a gestalt diagnosis of FAS, atypical FAS (AFAS) or possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE) prior to the development of the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. The outcomes of the patients were more accurately and comprehensively documented by the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, because of its use of quantitative, objective measurement scales and specific case definitions. The four digits in the code reflect the magnitude of expression of the four key diagnostic features of FAS in the following order: (1) growth deficiency; (2) the FAS facial phenotype; (3) central nervous system damage/dysfunction; (4) gestational alcohol exposure. The magnitude of expression of each feature is ranked independently on a four-point Likert scale with 1 reflecting complete absence of the FAS feature and 4 reflecting a strong \x91classic\x92 presence of the FAS feature. The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code is being used effectively for diagnosis, screening, and surveillance efforts in all Washington State FAS DPN clinics.'",0
"b'The assembly of the lipid-linked core oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the substrate for N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is catalyzed by different glycosyltransferases located at the membrane of the ER. We report on the identification and characterization of the ALG12 locus encoding a novel mannosyltransferase responsible for the addition of the [alpha]-1,6 mannose to dolichol-linked Man7GlcNAc2. The biosynthesis of the highly branched oligosaccharide follows an ordered pathway which ensures that only completely assembled oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid anchor to proteins. Using the combination of mutant strains affected in the assembly pathway of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and overexpression of distinct glycosyltransferases, we were able to define the substrate specificities of the transferases that are critical for branching. Our results demonstrate that branched oligosaccharide structures can be specifically recognized by the ER glycosyltransferases. This substrate specificity of the different transferases explains the ordered assembly of the complex structure of lipid-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in the endoplasmic reticulum.'",2
"b'The humoral immune response to arsonate (Ars) in normal A/J mice is dominated in the late primary and particularly in the secondary response by a recurrent and dominant idiotype (CRIA) which is encoded by a single canonical combination of the variable gene segments: VHidcr11\x96DFL16.1\x96JH2 and V{kappa}10\x96J{kappa}1. Accumulation of somatic mutations within cells expressing this canonical combination or some less frequent Ig rearrangements results in the generation of\r\n\r\nhigh-affinity antibodies. By contrast, in partially shielded and irradiated A/J mice (autologous reconstitution) immunized with Ars\x96keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), both the dominance of the CRIA idiotype and the affinity maturation are lost, whereas the anti-Ars antibody titer is not affected. To understand these alterations, we have analyzed a collection of 27 different anti-Ars hybridomas from nine partially shielded and irradiated A/J mice that had been immunized twice with Ars\x96KLH. Sequence analysis of the productively rearranged heavy chain variable region genes from those hybridomas revealed that (i) the canonical V(D)J combination was rare, (ii) the pattern of V(D)J gene usage rather corresponded to a primary repertoire with multiple gene combinations and (iii) the frequency of somatic mutations was low when compared to a normal secondary response to Ars. In addition, immunohistological analysis has shown a delay of 2 weeks in the appearance of full blown splenic germinal centers in autoreconstituting mice, as compared to controls. Such a model could be useful to understand the immunological defects found in patients transplanted with bone marrow.'",4
"b'Latexin, a carboxypeptidase A inhibitor, is expressed in a subset of neurons in the infragranular layers of the lateral cortex in the rat. We here show that latexin-expressing neurons exhibit ultrastructural features common to cortical pyramidal neurons. We show in combined retrograde tracing and immunofluorescent experiments that latexin-expressing neurons contribute to specific corticocortical pathways. Thus, injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold into either the primary somatosensory (SI) or the primary motor (MI) cortical area labeled many latexin-expressing neurons in the infragranular layers of the secondary somatosensory (SII) and visceral sensory (Vi) areas. In contrast, tracer injections involving the thalamus, striatum, or contralateral SII and Vi exclusively labeled latexin-nonexpressing neurons in both the SII and Vi. Finally, we show that the correct corticocortical projections can be formed in organotypic slice cultures in vitro from latexin-expressing neurons: when slices of developing SII were cocultured with those from the SI and the thalamus, latexin-immunoreactive neurons in the SII projected preferentially to their normal SI target. The specific connectivity formed in vivo and in vitro by this molecularly distinct neuronal population reveals its characteristic manner of cortical organization and provides a unique model system to analyze mechanisms underlying the formation of precise corticocortical pathways.'",1
"b'Three mAb (R2/60, S7 and 1B11) were used to study the expression of murine CD43 on peripheral T cells and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) from normal mice, and from mice during acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). In the spleen, essentially all T cells expressed the R2/60 and S7 antigens, whereas the 1B11 antigen was expressed on about half of the CD8+ cells and ~15% of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, a significant proportion of resting splenic B cells expressed the 1B11 and R2/60 antigens, but not the S7 antigen. The majority of IEL expressed R2/60 antigen; however, the S7 and 1B11 markers were differentially expressed on CD8{alpha}, CD8\xdf, TCR{alpha}\xdf and TCR{gamma}{delta} cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses identified characteristic 115 and 130 kDa reactive components from IEL lysates with mAb S7 and 1B11 respectively, and reactivity to both molecular entities by mAb R2/60. During acute intestinal GVHD induced by injecting CB6F1 athymic nude mice with spleen cells from C57BL/6 enhanced-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, 80\x9690% of donor T cells in the intestine epithelium expressed all CD43 isoforms; however, the level of expression of the 130 kDa CD43 antigen increased significantly and the level of the 115 kDa antigen decreased on GVHD donor T cells compared to cells at the time of transfer. Using EL4 cells, a similar shift in the expression of CD43 isoforms occurred experimentally following treatment with neuraminidase, suggesting that the type of CD43 isoform expressed on T cells is strongly influenced by conditions which affect membrane charge. The significance of these findings for intestinal immunopathology is discussed.'",4
"b'Under natural conditions, stimuli reaching the two ears contain multiple acoustic components. Rarely does a stimulus containing only one component (e.g. pure tone burst) exist outside the realm of the laboratory. For example, in sound localization the simultaneous presence of multiple cues (spectral content, level, phase, etc.) serves to increase the number of available cues and provide the listener with more information, thereby helping to reduce errors in locating the sound source. The present study was designed to explore the relationship between two acoustic parameters: stimulus frequency and interaural intensity disparities (IIDs). By varying both stimulus frequency and IIDs for each cell, we hoped to gain insight into how multiple cues are processed. To this end, we examined the responses of neurons in cat primary auditory cortex (AI) to determine if their sensitivity to IIDs changed as a function of stimulus frequency. IIDs ranging from +30 to \x9630 dB were presented at different frequencies (frequency was always the same in the two ears). We found that approximately half of the units examined exhibited responses to IIDs that varied as a function of stimulus frequency (i.e. displayed some form of IID x Freq dependency). The remaining units displayed IID responses that were not clearly related to stimulus frequency.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The human V2 vasopressin receptor contains one consensus site for N-linked glycosylation at asparagine 22 in the predicted extracellular amino terminal segment of the protein. This segment also contains clusters of serines and threonines that are potential sites for O-glycosylation. Mutagenesis of asparagine 22 to glutamine abolished N-linked glycosylation of the V2 receptor (N22Q-V2R), without altering its function or level of expression. The N22Q-V2R expressed in transfected cells migrated in denaturing acrylamide gels as two protein bands with a difference of 7000 Da. Protein labeling experiments demonstrated that the faster band could be chase to the slower one suggesting the presence of O-linked sugars. Sialidase treatment of membranes from cells expressing the N22Q-V2R or of immunoprecipitated metabolically labeled V2R accelerated the migration of the protein in acrylamide gels demonstrating the existence of O-glycosylation, the first time this type of glycosylation has been found in a G protein coupled receptor. Synthesis of metabolically labeled receptor in the presence of 1 mM phenyl-N-acetyl-[alpha]-d-galactosaminide, a competitive inhibitor of N-acetyl-[alpha]-d-galactose and N-acetylneuraminic acid transferases, also produced a receptor that migrated faster in denaturing gels. Serines and threonines present in the amino terminus were analyzed by alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify the acceptor sites. O-glycosylation was found at most serines and threonines present in the amino terminus. Because the disappearance of a site opened the availability of others to the transferases, the exact identification of the acceptor sites was not feasible. The wild type V2R expressed in HEK 293, COS, or MDCK cells underwent N- and O-linked glycosylation. The mutant V2R bearing all serine/threonine substitutions by alanine at the amino terminus yielded a receptor functionally indistinguishable from the wild type protein, whose mobility in polyacrylamide gels was no longer affected by sialidase treatment.'",2
"b""The issue of Zeitschuft f\xfcr Krebsforschung in which Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's1 paper appeared did not reach Britain during the war (although most other issues did) and it is still not held by many libraries and was not indexed in the cumulative medical index. It is understandable, therefore, that it was not mentioned at the conference held by the Medical Research Council in 1947 to discuss the reasons for the increase in mortality attributed to lung cancer (Hill, personal communication) and was not referred to when Hill and I published our first paper on the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer,2 although we did refer to M\xfcller's paper that had been published in 1939.3 Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's paper came to the attention of British research workers sometime in the next 2 years and was listed as one among several papers that had previously reported an association between smoking and lung cancer in the final report of our case-control study4 and it was subsequently noted regularly in reviews of the subject on both sides of the Atlantic. In Germany it received a mixed reception. It was mentioned by Bauer5 in his textbook on cancer (though its conclusions were not endorsed) and was accepted in East Germany by Lickint6 who had long been convinced of the hazards of smoking. In West Germany, however, interest in the effects of smoking waned, as a reaction to the anti-smoking policies of the Nazi government, and it came to be ignored. It has consequently never been properly reviewed and its conclusions not emphasized until Davey Smith, Str\xf6bele and Egger drew attention to it 50 years later in an article on Nazi medicine in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health in 1994.7\r\n\r\nJudged by modern standards of epidemiology Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's work fails on several grounds: (1) the small number of cases of lung cancer (93 men and 16 women), (2) the use of surrogate informants for the patients who had died from cancer and living informants for information about themselves for the controls, (3) the low response rate to the questionnaires about the cancer patients (53% for those with lung cancer, 40\x9660% for those with cancers of the tongue, oesophagus, stomach, colon, and prostate, and an even lower rate [39%] for the controls) and (4) the use of controls in only one narrow age group (53\x9654 years) selected to correspond with the average age of the lung cancer patients (53.9 years).\r\n\r\nThe epidemiology of non-communicable diseases was, however, in its infancy at the time and it would be unfair to the authors to judge their work in this way. However, it should be noted that much higher standards had already been set in a few studies, notably in the UK by Lane-Claypon8 in her study of 500 cases of breast cancer and 500 controls and by Stocks and Karn9 in their study of the diet of 462 patients with a variety of cancers and 435 controls, and in the US by English et al.10 in their study of smoking and myocardial infarction.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Schairer and Sch\xf6niger's study lay in the fact that they compared their findings for people who had died from lung cancer with those for people who had died from other types of cancer, principally stomach cancer (then the most prevalent type of fatal cancer in Germany, as it was in most of the developed world), as well as with their findings for healthy controls. Its value lies principally in their percipient discussion of the meaning of their findings.\r\n\r\nThey noted the great differences they recorded in the proportions of heavy smokers and of non-smokers in their lung cancer patients compared with those recorded for gastric cancer and control subjects and the similarity of their results with those obtained earlier by M\xfcller3 (whose findings had stimulated their enquiry). They also highlighted the increase in the frequency with which lung cancer had occurred over the previous 20 years, its correspondence with the increased use of tobacco, the greater frequency of the disease in men than in women (corresponding to the sex difference in smoking), the successful induction of cancer on the skin of animals by the application of tobacco tar by Roffo11 and the presence in such tar of \x91the strongly carcinogenic benzpyrene\x92. When all these pieces of evidence were combined Schairer and Sch\xf6niger thought the total evidence made a strong case for causality, particularly as they were able to cite several reasons (q.v.) for thinking that occupation, combustion engines and city life could not account for the findings. Their list of evidence, it may be noted, includes most of the types described later by Hill12 as guidelines that could be used to determine causality.\r\n\r\nOne piece of the evidence would, however, have been disputed in the UK, for the temperature at which Roffo burnt his tobacco was greater than the temperature at which tobacco is burnt in normal smoking and, although Kennaway's colleagues eventually showed that benzo(a)pyrene was present in normal tobacco smoke in small amounts13 and Wynder et al.14 showed that cancers could be produced on the skin of animals by prolonged painting with tars produced at the appropriate temperature, Roffo's experiments should not have been cited as biological evidence of the plausibility of a causal relationship.\r\n\r\nSchairer and Sch\xf6niger realized the weaknesses in their study and noted that the proportion of non-smokers in their comparison groups were suspiciously high and that the low response rate in the controls might have biased the results; heavy smokers in particular having refrained from replying. Although these considerations should not, they thought, have applied to the other cancer comparison groups. Stomach cancer patients, however, might have suffered from a \x91weak stomach\x92 for some time and consequently refrained from heavy smoking. They recognized that their comparison material was \x91less than satisfactory\x92 and reached the cautious conclusion that \x91the association between heavy tobacco consumption and lung cancer is therefore statistically, and causally, only likely\x92 and that \x91larger investigations are required\x92.\r\n\r\nSchairer and Sch\xf6niger's article marks an important phase in the development of knowledge about the harmful effects of tobacco and has, until now, failed to receive the recognition that it deserves. It would be wrong, however, to suggest that it proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that smoking was an important cause of the disease, a conclusion that the authors themselves never claimed.""",3
"b'In the present study, we demonstrate that the non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-G impairs specific cytolytic T cell functions in addition to its well-established inhibition of NK lysis. The antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response analyzed was mediated by CD8+ T cells specific for the influenza virus matrix epitope, M58\x9666, presented by HLA-A2. The transfection of HLA-G1 cDNA in target cells carrying the M58\x9666 epitope reduced their lysis by these virus-specific CTL. This HLA-G-mediated inhibition of antigen-specific CTL lysis was (i) peptide dose dependent, (ii) reversed by blocking HLA-G with a specific mAb and (iii) still observed despite the blockade of HLA-E/CD94/NKG2A interaction. By inhibiting both CTL and NK functions, HLA-G appears to have an extensive role in immune tolerance.'",4
"b""My father, Professor Dr. med. Dietrich Eberhard Schairer, was born at Oberrot (Southern Germany) on 21 February 1907 as the first son of a medical practitioner. In 1925 he passed the Abitur at the Dillmann-Realgymnasium at Stuttgart. He then started to study medicine at the University of T\xfcbingen, where he passed the \x91Physikum\x92 (basic sciences exam at the end of the first year) in 1927. He continued to study medicine at the universities of Berlin, Freiburg (where he completed his doctoral thesis1) and Hamburg, where he passed the medical state exam in 1930. After medical training at the Universities of Cologne and later at the German Hospital in London he was houseman at the Protestant Hospital at Hattingen (North Rhine-Westphalia). Between 1932 and 1938 my father was tutorial assistant and later assistant at the Institute for Pathology of the University of T\xfcbingen with Professor Dietrich. In 1935 he qualified as a university lecturer with his postdoctoral thesis \x91Size determination of nuclei and determination of the number of chromosomes in human tumours\x92.2,3 Between 1938 and 1945 my father was a senior assistant and temporarily deputy director of the Institute for Pathology of the University of Jena under the directorship of Professor Gerlach. In 1943 he was appointed Professor. His work at the University of Jena was interrupted between 1939 and 1940 because he had to do military service and again in 1944 when he was sent to the eastern front as consultant pathologist. The last days of his stay at the crumbling east front are mentioned in Peter Bamm's book \x91Die unsichtbare Flagge\x92.4 He was then a prisoner of war under the British. During this time he was employed as a pathologist in Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein. At the end of 1945 he was released from captivity. In 1946 he took over my grandfather's general practice in the village of Lo\xdfburg, in the Black Forest. In 1951 he set up his own practice as a pathologist and medical microbiologist in Ulm where he finally set up his own institute in 1962. At the end of 1977 he retired from his pathological practice. From 1985 my father suffered from progressive dementia. After the death of my mother he was cared for in the family home of his daughter Ursula Hirrlinger at Bad Waldsee (Southern Germany) where he died on 23 January 1996, a few weeks before his 89th birthday.\r\n\r\nMy father devoted his life to the medical sciences, particularly to pathology and general practice, and to chamber music. He was very widely read and extremely hard working. He always had good relationships with his students, patients and colleagues. It was quite rare for us (his eight children) to see our father on workdays\x97he was either at the institute or performing dissections. He was an excellent pianist who could sight-read music with no difficulty, and hence we often had guests who came to make music with my father. When we lived in Jena his undergraduate students, doctoral students and some of his colleagues came every week to play chamber music.\r\n\r\nMy father's particular interests included carcinogenesis,5 iron6 and the metabolism of vitamin A,7 but his main interest was cancer research. The starting point of his studies on the association between smoking and lung cancer was the well-known observation that chimney sweeps were at particular risk of cancer of the scrotum, probably induced by soot or tar. He wondered if tar and its components would induce other cancers and hence started to treat the skin of experimental animals with tar from various sources. In these experiments he was able to produce squamous cell carcinoma. He suspected that the polycyclic aromatic compounds that are found in tar and in tobacco-derived condensates act as carcinogens. From these animal experiments and the observation that many of his patients who died from lung cancer were chain smokers he concluded in the 1930s that there must be an association between smoking and lung cancer. The next step was to initiate an epidemiological study with appropriate controls and this unequivocally demonstrated the association between smoking and lung cancer. But even in the mid-1960s, when I worked on my own doctoral thesis at the German Cancer Research Centre, the chief medical statistician did not accept my father's conclusions. Perhaps because he was a chain smoker himself!\r\n\r\nWhile working at Jena my father was asked to explore the possible cancer-inducing potency of saccharine, a synthetic sweetener. Though he did some work in this field he never published the results. I suppose that he could not demonstrate a correlation between saccharine consumption and bladder or liver cancer in experimental animals. The authorities would have used his saccharine data to justify a further reduction in the supply of sugar to the population. He therefore preferred not to publish these results.\r\n\r\nIn his recent book on the anti-smoking campaign during the Nazi regime, Robert Proctor8 suggests that my father and other scientists were working under the command of the Nazi administration. Other publications based on Proctor's work make the same assumption.9 I take issue with this interpretation. My father was a liberal person, as were many academics from Swabia. My father regarded the party manifesto of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party) as inhuman and against freedom of speech and freedom of thought, the basis of intellectual creativity. He was convinced that the Nazi ghost story would find its end soon. My father never was a member of the resistance and he was not a hero, although he admired the would-be assassin Georg Elsner who tried to kill Hitler in the Hofbr\xe4ukeller at Munich. Indeed, he was considered politically unreliable and found it difficult to get a job as lecturer at the University of T\xfcbingen. He was not considered for the directorship of the Pathological Institute of the University of Jena when a successor for Professor Gerlach was sought. My father was sent to the eastern front in 1944 despite the fact that my mother was pregnant with her eighth child at the time. Men with large families usually did not have to do military service. Only a relatively small number of German soldiers returned from the Russian front, but luckily my father was among them.\r\n\r\nWhen my father returned from British captivity he tried to get an appropriate position at a West German University Institute of pathology which would have allowed him to continue with his research, but he had returned too late. The senior posts had already been reshuffled among those who were in West Germany at the end of the war. He would not accept offers of chairs outside West Germany because my mother preferred to stay in Germany. My father thus had no choice but to work as a general practitioner and later as a pathologist and microbiologist in his private institute. He often complained in later life that he was unable to continue his basic research because he could not get a university position.\r\n\r\nAs my father was an excellent cancer diagnostician, he was sent tissue specimens from colleagues all over the world, and his children got the stamps! The most valuable characteristics that distinguished my father were his ability to observe and to recognize patterns, both prerequisites for an excellent diagnostician and research scientist. He could also sight-read piano music, recognize most mountains of the Alps by their position and form, and name much of the European flora and fauna.\r\n\r\n\r\n""",3
"b""There is controversial evidence that neocortical projections to the neostriatum may regulate the neostriatal expression of the proenkephalin (PEnk) gene. Therefore, we have studied PEnk gene expression in organotypic neocortico-neostriatal co-cultures as well as cultures of isolated neostriata. PEnk mRNA was determined with in situ hybridization. Removal of the neocortex caused a time-dependent reduction in the number of neostriatal cells which showed expression of the PEnk gene. A maximal decrease was seen after 3 days. Within 2 days after blockade of glutamate receptors of the NMDA type significantly fewer neostriatal cells expressed the PEnk gene, indicating that NMDA receptors mediated the expression of the gene. In isolated neostriatal slices in which the expression of the PEnk gene had been down-regulated, NMDA increased the number of cells which expressed the gene in a time-dependent manner. Maximal expression was observed after 3 days. This induction was reduced by nimodipine, which blocks L-type Ca2+-channels. The slow increase in PEnk gene expression caused by NMDA resembled a recruiting process. It seems to be specific for the neostriatum and may be due to the latter's neuronal organization.""",1
"b'Background The factors that cause the allergic sensitization and inflammation in asthma still remain to be clarified. A role for Chlamydia pneumoniae has been suggested although serological studies have produced conflicting findings. This study aims to clarify the relationship between asthmatic variables and C. pneumoniae serological status.\r\n\r\nMethods A case-control study was undertaken on an asthma-enriched subset from a longitudinal birth cohort. In all, 198 subjects (96 with self-reported asthma) had C. pneumoniae serology (microimmunofluorescence [MIF] IgG, IgA) undertaken at age 11 and age 21 and assessment made in relation to a number of asthma variables.\r\n\r\nResults The only statistically significant finding was in subjects self-reporting asthma at age 21 who had evidence of lower IgG titres (P = 0.046), a finding in the opposite direction to that expected from the hypothesis. Subjects with high IgG titres (>=128) were less likely to have reported ever having asthma; odds ratio (OR) = 0.29, (95% CI : 0.10\x960.87). No association existed between symptoms suggestive of asthma in the previous 12 months and either IgG (P = 0.127) or IgA (P = 0.189) antibody titres at age 21. Likewise, no association was found between symptoms suggestive of asthma in the previous two years and C. pneumoniae IgG antibody titre (P = 0.81) at age 11. There was no evidence of an association with any of the other variables examined at either age 11 or age 21. These included use of inhaled steroids, serum IgE levels, airway responsiveness, skin test evidence of atopy, or smoking status.\r\n\r\nConclusion The results of this study suggest that C. pneumoniae infection when diagnosed by MIF serology is not a major risk factor for the development of asthma in children and young adults. The study has not, however, addressed the role this organism may play in specific asthmatic subsets or asthma exacerbations.'",3
"b""Seventy-two alcoholics were treated with acupuncture to the ear in a randomized single-blind controlled design over 10 weeks. Orthodox points and incorrect points 3\x965 mm from orthodox points were used. No initial differences were found regarding social characteristics, the responses to the Swedish version of the Alcohol Use Inventory and the Three-dimensional Personality Questionnaire, indicating a successful randomization. There were non-significant tendencies towards gender differential response after acupuncture treatment (P = 0.07). There was no difference in the number of drinking days or level of craving between treatment and control patients. Among females, those in the treatment group reported reduction of anxiety after 1 month, more often than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Response to acupuncture was not related to personality or drinking pattern. Patients' experience of needle placement was similar in the study and control groups. The effects of acupuncture were less pronounced than those previously reported.""",0
"b'Alcohol is a porphyrinogenic agent which may cause disturbances in porphyrin metabolism in healthy persons as well as biochemical and clinical manifestations of acute and chronic hepatic porphyrias. After excessive consumption of alcohol, a temporary, clinically asymptomatic secondary hepatic coproporphyrinuria is observable, which can become persistent in cases of alcohol-induced liver damage. Nowadays, the alcohol\x96liver\x96porphyrinuria syndrome is the first to be mentioned in secondary hepatic disturbances of porphyrin metabolism. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria) are considered to be molecular regulatory diseases, in contrast to non-acute, chronic hepatic porphyria, clinically appearing as porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Porphyrins do not accumulate in the liver in acute porphyrias, whereas in chronic hepatic porphyrias they do. Thus, chronic hepatic porphyria is a porphyrin-accumulation disease, whereas acute hepatic porphyrias are haem-pathway-dysregulation diseases, characterized in general by induction of {delta}-aminolevulinic acid synthase in the liver and excessive stimulation of the pathway without storage of porphyrins in the liver. The clinical expression of acute hepatic porphyrias can be triggered by alcohol, because alcohol augments the inducibility of {delta}-aminolevulinic acid synthase. In chronic hepatic porphyrias, however, which are already associated with liver damage, alcohol potentiates the disturbance of the decarboxylation of uro- and heptacarboxyporphyrinogen, which is followed by a hepatic accumulation of uro- and heptacarboxyporphyrin and their sometimes extreme urinary excretion. Especially in persons with a genetic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, but also in patients with the so-called sporadic variety of PCT, alcohol is able to transform an asymptomatic coproporphyrinuria into PCT. Alcohol has many biochemical and clinical effects on porphyrin and haem synthesis both in humans and laboratory animals. Ethanol suppresses the activity of porphobilinogen synthase (synonym: {delta}-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase), uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase, whereas it induces the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, {delta}-aminolevulinic acid synthase and also porphobilinogen deaminase. Therefore, teetotalism is a therapeutically and prophylactically important measure in all types of hepatic porphyrias.'",0
"b'MyD88 is an adaptor molecule essential for signaling via the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 receptor family. TLR4 is a member of the TLR family and a point mutation in the Tlr4 gene causes hyporesponsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C3H/HeJ mice. We have previously shown that both TLR4- and MyD88-deficient mice are hyporesponsive to LPS. In this study we examined the responsiveness of these two knockout mice to various bacterial cell wall components. Cells from TLR4-deficient mice responded to several kinds of LPS, peptidoglycan and crude cell wall preparation from Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacterial lysates. In contrast, macrophages and splenocytes from MyD88-deficient mice did not respond to any of the bacterial components we tested. These results show that MyD88 is essential for the cellular response to bacterial cell wall components.'",4
"b""The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake sites assessed with both [3H]imipramine and [3H]paroxetine, and the 5-HT2A receptors were simultaneously measured in platelets from 24 male subjects meeting the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence and admitted for inpatient detoxification. Blood samples from alcoholic patients were collected during acute alcohol intoxication (day 0), during withdrawal (day 1), and after 2 weeks of abstinence (day 14). All patients met the criteria for type II alcoholism. Alcohol misuse was found to be associated with an increased number and a lower affinity of [3H]paroxetine binding in comparison to the control values. Abstinence from alcohol for 2 weeks (day 14) resulted in a decrease in the number of 5-HT uptake sites labelled with [3H]paroxetine compared to normal values, together with a significant decrease in the number of 5-HT2A binding sites. The present data indicate that altered serotonergic function existing in alcoholic patients is a reversible phenomenon that normalizes after detoxification and withdrawal.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Hippocampal depotentiation comprises a reversal of tetanization- induced long-term potentiation (LTP) which occurs following low-frequency stimulation. In the CA1 region, it has been reported that agonist activation of D1/D5 dopamine receptors enhances LTP expression and inhibits depotentiation. The role of these receptors in synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) has not been characterized. This study therefore investigated the role of D1/D5 receptors in LTP and depotentiation in the DG of freely moving rats. Male Wistar rats underwent chronic implantation of a recording electrode in the DG granule cell layer, a bipolar stimulating electrode in the medial perforant path and a cannula in the ipsilateral cerebral ventricle (to enable drug administration). The D1/D5 agonist Chloro-PB dose-dependently inhibited depotentation in the DG. This effect was prevented by the D1/D5 antagonist SCH 23390. Neither D1/D5 agonist nor antagonist had an effect on LTP expression or basal synaptic transmission. These results highlight differences between D1/D5 receptor-involvement in LTP and depotentiation in the CA1 region and DG, and indicate that whereas D1/D5 receptor activation may not be a critical factor in LTP induction in the DG, a differential role for these receptors in the expression of depotentiation, in this hippocampal subfield, may exist.'",1
b'The use of screening questionnaires to detect early problem drinking has been stimulated by the development of the AUDIT (Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test). A comparison of a computerized version of the test and its paper and pencil original was conducted on 110 consecutive attenders at an alcoholism day-treatment facility. The findings suggest that the computer version is as acceptable as the paper and pencil one and that scores on the two formats are comparable.\r\n\r\n',0
"b'After infection with some viruses and intracellular parasites, antibody production is restricted to IgG2a. We first observed that, whereas live viruses such as lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) or mouse adenovirus induced mostly an IgG2a response, a large proportion of antibodies produced against killed viruses were IgG1. This IgG1 antiviral response was suppressed when live virions were added to inactivated viral particles. These results indicate that the IgG2a preponderance is related to the infectious process itself rather than to the type of antigen involved. Since IFN-{gamma} is known to stimulate IgG2a production by activated B lymphocytes and to be secreted after infection, we examined the role of this cytokine in the antibody isotypic distribution caused by LDV. Most IgG2a responses were relatively unaffected in mice deficient for the IFN-{gamma} receptor or treated with anti-IFN-{gamma} antibody. A similar IFN-{gamma}-independent IgG2a secretion was observed after infection with the parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the IFN-{gamma}-independent IgG2a production triggered by infection still required the presence of functional Th lymphocytes. Therefore, signal(s) other than IFN-{gamma} secretion may explain the Th-dependent isotypic bias in antibody secretion triggered by viruses and parasites.'",4
"b""To investigate the correspondence between readiness for behaviour change in general and readiness for alcohol related help-seeking in particular. A related aim was to examine how, if at all, measures of dependence severity, use, and consequences were related to a composite measure depicting agreements and disagreements between general change readiness and help-seeking readiness. Methods: Non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent patients, numbering 549, from general hospitals in Germany were interviewed. Results: When taking into account both dimensions of motivation, findings indicate 42% of the subjects were characterized by different motivation levels regarding readiness for change and readiness for help-seeking. Higher help-seeking readiness was associated with higher alcohol problem severity. Readiness to change was not affected by alcohol problem severity. Conclusions: Findings underscore the need to evaluate both motivational constructs in determining clients' need and receptivity to formal help.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'Streptococcus oralis is the agent of a large number of infections in immunocompromised patients, but little is known regarding the mechanisms by which this fermentative organism proliferates in vivo. Glycoproteins are widespread within the circulation and host tissues, and could provide a source of fermentable carbohydrate for the growth of those pathogenic organisms with the capacity to release monosaccharides from glycans via the production of specific glycosidases. The ability of acute phase serum [alpha]1-acid glycoprotein to support growth of S.oralis in vitro has been examined as a model for growth of this organism on N-linked glycoproteins. Growth was accompanied by the production of a range of glycosidases (sialidase, N-acetyl-[beta]-d-glucosaminidase, and [beta]-d-galactosidase) as measured using the 4-methylumbelliferone-linked substrates. The residual glycoprotein glycans remaining during growth of this organism were released by treatment with hydrazine and their analysis by HPAEC-PAD and MALDI demonstrated extensive degradation of all glycan chains with only terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to asparagines of the protein backbone remaining when growth was complete. Monosaccharides were released sequentially from the glycans by S.oralis glycosidases in the order sialic acid, galactose, fucose, nonterminal N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose due to the actions of exo-glycosidic activities, including mannosidases which have not previously been reported for S.oralis. All released monosaccharides were metabolized during growth with the exception of fucose which remained free in culture supernatants. Direct release of oligosaccharides was not observed, indicating the absence of endo-glycosidases in S.oralis. We propose that this mechanism of deglycosylation of host glycoproteins and the subsequent utilization of released monosaccharides is important in the survival and persistence of this and other pathogenic bacteria in vivo.'",2
"b'Cross-linking of the IgM antigen receptor on an immature B cell lymphoma (BKS-2) induces growth arrest and apoptosis. This is accompanied by down-regulation of the immediate early genes, egr-1 and c-myc, and a reduction in NF-{kappa}B activity. Anti-IgM-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of this murine B cell lymphoma were prevented by oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing the CpG motif, which are also known to be stimulatory for mature and immature B cells. The CpG but not non-CpG ODN rescued BKS-2 cells from anti-IgM-mediated growth inhibition by up-regulation of egr-1 and c-myc expression as well as by restoring NF-{kappa}B activity. Interestingly, changes in egr-1 expression occurred more rapidly than in c-myc expression. Also the c-myc levels remained high up to 6 h after addition of the anti-IgM, which was also the time until which the addition of CpG could be delayed without affecting its ability to provide complete protection. This CpG-induced rescue of B lymphoma cells was blocked by antisense egr-1 ODN, suggesting that the expression of egr-1 is important for the effects of CpG ODN on the growth and survival of BKS-2 cells.'",4
"b'This morphometric study examined two aspects of corpus callosum development: pediatric cortico-callosal topography and developmental neuroplasticity subsequent to perinatal brain injury. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify the total midsagittal cross-sectional area and five anterioposterior subregions of the callosum in 10 children with focal lesions and 86 healthy volunteer control subjects. Nine of the ten children with early injury showed a reduction in the total area of the callosum relative to matched controls. The area of the total callosum cross-section was inversely proportional to the size of lesion. All patients displayed region-specific size reduction. This regional thinning bore a topographical relationship to the lesion sites. Reduction in anterior subregions 1, 2 and 3 was respectively associated with lesions in the anterior inferior frontal area, the middle and superior frontal region, and the precentral area. Attenuation of subregion 4 corresponded to anterior parietal lesions, and thinning of subregion 5 occurred with posterior parietal injury. This cortical-callosal pattern coincides with adult and nonhuman primate mappings. Callosal thinning despite the early onset of the lesions suggests limits to developmental neuroplasticity.'",1
"b'Three distinct bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were expanded from BALB/c BM cells by culture with (i) granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus IL-3, (ii) GM-CSF, IL-3 plus Th1-biasing cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-{gamma}) or (iii) GM-CSF, IL-3 plus Th2-biasing cytokines (IL-4). All of these cells expressed the DC-specific marker CD11c, and were designated as BMDC0, BMDC1 and BMDC2 cells respectively. BMDC1 cells exhibited superior T cell-stimulating activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), while BMDC2 showed inferior stimulating activity. Specifically, BMDC1, as compared with BMDC2, induced a higher frequency of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells in MLC. Moreover, BMDC1, but not BMDC2, were strong inducers of H-2d-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in MLC. BMDC0 always showed intermediate stimulatory activity; however, when BMDC0 were cultured with IFN-{gamma}, they differentiated into BMDC1-like stimulator cells concomitant with the up-regulation of both MHC antigens and co-stimulatory molecules. In contrast, BMDC2 were refractory to differentiation into superior stimulator cells by treatment with IFN-{gamma}, although this treatment enhanced MHC expression. These findings indicate that Th1- and Th2-biasing cytokines, in addition to their effect on Th cell differentiation, may play a critical role in the functional skewing of DC. These findings have important implications for the development of DC-based immunotherapies.\r\n\r\n'",4
"b'The findings of Truelsen and colleagues1 confirm earlier reports of the inverse association of lung function with risk of both fatal and non-fatal stroke.2,3 Is a link between markers of abnormal vascular biology and airway function surprising? The relationship is attenuated when adjustment is made for other potential confounders, particularly age, sex and smoking. This shows that much of the relationship is explained by these factors. While there remains a possibility that residual confounding, due to imprecise measurement of lifetime tobacco exposure, is a sufficient explanation for the findings, among those who have never smoked, a relationship between low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and cardiovascular disease is still seen.4,5 Sick people tend to have low FEV1, in part because of the muscle weakness associated with the cachexia of illness and old age, and in part because of inability to make a maximal expiratory effort. Analysis of the FEV1-stroke relationship comparing FEV1-stroke associations for strokes occurring within 5 years of measurement of lung function and for those occurring subsequently might detect a potential ill-health bias.\r\n\r\nTraditionally FEV1 is adjusted for height (as taller people have bigger lungs), but this adjustment hides the independent association between adult height and stroke.6 It would be preferable to examine FEV1-stroke relationships making progressive adjustment for age, smoking and height rather than using an adjusted FEV1 as the exposure variable, as has been done recently.7 As height is composed of trunk and leg lengths, it is likely that height may have an effect on risk of stroke by two mechanisms\x97as an easier and more accurate measure of lung volume (i.e. a proxy for FEV1) and as an indirect measure of leg length. Leg length is a marker of childhood nutritional status and growth and has been shown to correlate closely with risk of cardiovascular disease in adult life.8\r\n\r\nThe maternal-fetal environment determines susceptibility to reduced FEV1, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and atherosclerosis in later life.9\x9614 Hence, the link between FEV1 and vascular pathology may reflect common early life determinants. It is now important to establish the underlying mechanisms that are responsible and discover how they operate throughout the life course. Truelsen and colleagues propose that increased susceptibility to infections found in individuals with reduced lung function results in raised blood viscosity which increases the risk of vascular occlusion and consequently, stroke. Pelkonen and colleagues suggest that the mechanism is hypoxaemia resulting from airway obstruction due to repeated inflammation.4 Both these hypotheses seems inadequate to explain the graded relationship seen in this and other studies. Haematocrit, blood viscosity and hypoxaemia only increase at very low levels of FEV1 and it is likely that infections would be no more or less likely among people in the mid-range and bottom of the FEV1 distribution. Furthermore, as both reduced FEV1 and vascular disease develop over many decades, either may precede the other, making attribution of causality difficult. Therefore hypotheses, also suggested by other workers,15 that reduced lung function is a stimulant of pathogenetic mechanisms in different organ systems seem improbable.\r\n\r\nIt is known that FEV1 is associated with carotid artery intimal-medial thickness16 and it is possible that FEV1 is acting as a marker for smooth muscle hyperplasia and an increased likelihood of developing carotid plaques. Abnormalities of shared underlying mechanisms controlling the balanced interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix in the blood vessels and airways should therefore be considered. Previously, within the same population sample, Lange and colleagues have shown an inverse association between plasma glucose and FEV1.17 Furthermore, in the Normative Aging Study, a negative correlation was found between FEV1 and fasting insulin and the fasting insulin resistance index.18 Raised glucose, raised insulin and insulin resistance are risk factors for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and are regulated by the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis.19,20 Hence, in the development of vascular and airways disease, altered activity of the GH/IGF-1 axis at different stages of the life course may be relevant.\r\n\r\nAdvanced glycation end-products (AGE) could also be a plausible part of this conundrum. Advanced glycation end-products accumulate on long-lived extracellular matrix proteins and have been implicated in diabetic and non-diabetic atherosclerotic complications21 and are considered contributory to reduced FEV1 found in diabetics and in relation to ageing.22 In arterial sections taken at the time of coronary artery by-pass in euglycaemic normolipidaemic individuals, using immunoassays, levels of serum AGE-modified lipoproteins were found to correlate with arterial tissue AGE and atherosclerosis.23 Advanced glycation end-products can mediate upregulation of different growth factors such as the IGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) through a receptor-mediated mechanism.24 Insulin-like growth factors and TGF-beta have been identified in asthmatic airways and can stimulate pro-collagen production, fibroblast proliferation, and possibly subepithelial fibrosis that will eventually result in lung function impairment.25,26 Insulin, glucose, IGF and their binding proteins are growth promoters for arterial cells and act together in stimulating smooth muscle migration and proliferation implicated in the development of experimental atherosclerotic lesions.27,28\r\n\r\nFuture work should explore the role of glucose, insulin, growth factors such as GH/IGF and TGF-beta and AGE as components in causal pathways responsible for health-disease links between blood vessels and airways. With this population sample and others, examination of the rate of decline in FEV1 and stroke would be particularly informative. If relationships between stroke are stronger with rate of decline than with baseline levels, this would suggest that the mechanisms responsible operate in adult life. It would also be useful to examine familial aggregation of markers of atheroma, stroke, myocardial infarction and reduced FEV1 since this may indicate an additional genetic influence.'",3
"b'Most human adults carry the Epstein\x96Barr virus (EBV) and develop immunological memory against the structural and the virus-encoded cellular proteins. The EBV nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) elicits cytotoxic T cell responses and it also maintains a persistent antibody response. The majority of sera from EBV-seropositive individuals reacts with a synthetic peptide, p63, comprising 21 amino acids of a repetitive region of EBNA6. CD4+ T lymphocytes, with specificity for p63, could be recalled from the T cell repertoire of EBV carriers that expressed certain HLA-DR allotypes which were identified as good binders of p63 by an in vitro flow cytometric assay. Analysis of the HLA-DR/p63 interaction by molecular mechanics calculations indicated the presence of multiple overlapping epitopes which were predicted to bind in a HLA-DRB1 allo- and subtype-specific manner. Specific activation of p63-selected long-term CD4+ T cell cultures resulted in a proliferative response, in the production of IL-2 and in the secretion of high levels of tumor necrosis factor as measured by bioassays. Proliferation and cytokine production of p63-specific T cells could be induced by p63-loaded HLA-DR-matched antigen-presenting cells and by B cells co-expressing relevant HLA-DR molecules and EBNA6. Our results show that peptides of an EBNA6 repeat region induce CD4+ T cells which can react with EBNA6-carrying cells in many individuals. We suggest that these Th cells may be important in conditioning dendritic cells for initiation potent virus-specific immune responses, provide help for EBV-specific B cells, drive IgG isotype switch and support the sustained effector function of memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes.'",4

However, in some areas Geneva fares worse than the rest of Switzerland or Europe. To re-appraise the current health priorities of the Genevan population, we analysed the relative importance of specific diseases and injuries calculating DALYs.\r\n\r\nMethods We followed the procedures developed for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to ensure comparability. Some adaptations were made for mortality coding. Disability was estimated based on data for countries classified as Established Market Economies (EME) in the GBD study.\r\n\r\nResults Non-communicable diseases accounted for 79% of the disability adjusted life years (DALY), injuries represented 12%, and communicable diseases and other disorders 9%. Ischaemic heart disease was the largest single contributor to DALY, followed by unipolar major depression. Neuropsychiatric disorders and mental health accounted for more than 23% of DALY.\r\n\r\nConclusions Some of the most important problems identified\x97depression, osteoarthritis and alcohol abuse\x97would have been overlooked in an analysis based solely on mortality data. The most striking finding is the importance of mental health problems. The main limitation is the lack of morbidity data for Geneva.'",3
"b'Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (i-IEL) of aged rats comprise CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ and CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ T cells expressing TCR {alpha}\xdf. In the present study, we compared characteristics between CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ and CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL, which were purified by a cell sorter from the i-IEL of 6-month-old Lewis rats. Most of the CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL were of the CD44high phenotype, while CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL were CD44low. V\xdf usage in the CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL was much diversified, while CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL showed a skewed V\xdf repertoire. The CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL but not the CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL proliferated in response to syngeneic spleen cells, which was partially inhibited by addition of anti-MHC class I mAb. The CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL produced IFN-{gamma} and IL-2 but no IL-4 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-\xdf in response to syngeneic spleen cells, while CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL produced abundant levels of TGF-\xdf but no IL-2, IFN-{gamma} or IL-4. CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL proliferated in response to exogenous IL-2 but not to IL-15, while CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL could respond to IL-15 as well as IL-2. These results suggest that a significant fraction of CD4+CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL belongs to Th1-type T cells capable of responding to self-MHC class I, while CD4\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ i-IEL are a unique population with a diversified V\xdf repertoire that respond to IL-15 in rats.'",4
"b'In this study we used a modified double-label deoxyglucose procedure to investigate attention-dependent modulations of deoxyglucose uptake at the earliest stages of the macaque visual system. Specifically, we compared activity levels evoked during two tasks with essentially identical visual stimulation requiring different attentional demands. During a featural-attention task, the subjects had to discriminate the orientation of a grating; during a control spatial-attention task, they had to localize the position of a target point. Comparison of the resulting activity maps revealed attention-dependent changes in metabolic activity in portions of the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the magnocellular-recipient layers 4C{alpha} and 4B of the striate cortex. In these early stages of the visual system, attention to the orientation of the grating suppressed the metabolic activity in a retinotopically specific band peripheral to the representation of the stimulus. These results favor an early selection model of attention. After a thalamic attention-dependent gating mechanism, irrelevant visual information outside the focus of attention may be suppressed at the level of the striate cortex, which would then result in an increased signal-to-noise ratio for the processing of the attended feature in higher-tier, less retinotopically organized, extrastriate visual areas.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Fetal and lactational exposure to alcohol can induce impairments to the immune system and lead to decreased resistance to certain infectious agents. Morphometric procedures were used to quantify changes induced by maternal ethanol consumption in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue of rat pups. Rats were pair-fed with ethanol-containing or isocaloric control liquid diets formulated for pregnant and lactating animals from day 1 of pregnancy and throughout the lactation periods. Pups were weaned and placed on control liquid diet on post-natal day 21. Intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes and macrophages were evaluated on post-natal days 14, 18, and 25. Lower thymus weights were observed in the ethanol-exposed pups on post-natal days 14 and 18 and lower total thymocyte counts on post-natal day 14. On post-natal day 14, T cells, T cytotoxic cells, IgA plasma cells, and macrophages were decreased in the ileal epithelial and lamina propria areas in the ethanol-exposed, compared to the pair-fed, pups. No differences for any of the above cell counts were found in the jejunum on post-natal day 14. On post-natal day 18, macrophages were still decreased in the ileum in the ethanol-treated pups, compared to pair-fed animals. No differences were found in T cells, T cytotoxic cells, and IgA lymphocytes between groups in either the jejunum or ileum on post-natal days 18 and 25. This study suggests that fetal and lactational exposure to ethanol has some effects on the development or influx of intraepithelial and lamina propria leukocytes and that the changes are most pronounced in early neonatal life.'",0
"b'An in vivo preparation has been developed to study the mechanisms underlying spontaneous sleep oscillations. Dual and triple simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from neurons in small isolated cortical slabs (10 mm x 6 mm) in anesthetized cats. Spontaneously occurring slow sleep oscillations, present in the adjacent intact cortex, were absent in small slabs. However, the isolated slabs displayed brief active periods separated by long periods of silence, up to 60 s in duration. During these silent periods, 60% of neurons showed non-linear amplification of low-amplitude depolarizing activity. Nearly 40% of the cells, twice as many as in intact cortex, were classified as intrinsically bursting. In cortical network models based on Hodgkin\x96Huxley-like neurons, the summation of simulated spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was sufficient to activate a persistent sodium current, initiating action potentials in single neurons that then spread through the network. Consistent with this model, enlarging the isolated cortical territory to an isolated gyrus (30 mm x 20 mm) increased the probability of initiating large-scale activity. In these larger territories, both the frequency and regularity of the slow oscillation approached that generated in intact cortex. The frequency of active periods in an analytical model of the cortical network accurately predicted the scaling observed in simulations and from recordings in cortical slabs of increasing size.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""The burden of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke is considerable, representing 30% of all deaths worldwide, that is about 15 million deaths a year, of which 11 million are in developing or transitional countries.1 Commentators have pre-dicted a global epidemic of cardiovascular disease on the basis of current trends.2 One enthusiast has even stated that \x91In fact, cardiovascular disease is already the leading cause of death not only in developed countries but, as of the mid-1990s, in developing countries as well\x92,3 a statement not supported by data in the World Health Report 2000.4 Citing statistics in this way undoubtedly fuels the view that \x91something must be done\x92, promulgated by bodies such as the World Heart Federation.1 Clearly the absolute numbers of deaths should be related to the population at risk, which is substantially greater in developing countries of the world. The Global Burden of Disease study has attempted to provide a picture derived not only from mortality data but also from cardiovascular disability, some of which is consequent upon diseases other than coronary heart disease and stroke.5 This study demonstrated that while ischaemic heart disease and stroke were 5th and 6th in the 1990 league table of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), they contributed 20.4% of the DALYs in developed countries, but only 8.3% in developing countries.6 Concerns about the accuracy of international mortality data and the virtual absence of relevant incidence and disability data clearly need to be addressed urgently if the approach is to have validity.7\r\n\r\nEpidemiological studies in developing countries, although small in number, provide evidence that stroke mortality rates tend to be higher than coronary heart disease rates,8 and may be considerably higher than in developed countries,9 but both stroke prevalence10 and coronary heart disease prevalence11 are considerably lower, which may reflect more severe disease or worse health services, leading to higher case-fatality rates. The World Health Organization MONICA surveys, while dominated by developed countries, have data from China which experienced the lowest coronary heart disease event rates of any MONICA centre, but one of the highest annual relative increases among men, but not women.12 Adverse risk factor changes in Chinese men, but not women, were associated with the increased male event rate.13 Surveys of cardiovascular risk factors in developing countries tend to show lower mean levels of blood cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index; although urban levels may be closer to those found in developed countries.10,14,15 Smoking in developing countries is of growing concern as consumption in the developed world tends to contract, but manufacturers' cigarette production and profits increase markedly.16 Of the 1.1 billion smokers worldwide, 800 million live in developing countries\x97with 300 million in China. It is to be expected that the cardiovascular disease consequences of smoking will be increasingly felt as these comparatively young smokers age.17 It has been estimated that current smoking uptake rates in China will result in 100 million deaths among the 0.3 billion men aged now under 30 years, with half of these deaths occurring in middle age.18\r\n\r\nHealth promotion for cardiovascular diseases: the evidence\r\n\r\nThe prevention of cardiovascular disease traditionally relies on the control of risk factors among individuals as a major element of any strategy. Such approaches\x97generally termed health promotion\x97are well illustrated by the Healthy Cities programme,19 the British Health of the Nation strategy,20 the Adelaide Conference21 and the Ottawa Charter.22 Epidemiological evidence strongly supports the associations between cardiovascular diseases and smoking, high serum cholesterol, high blood pressure and physical inactivity. Modification of individual life style\x97stopping smoking, reducing dietary fat intake, avoiding obesity, and taking regular exercise\x97is a logical response to the growing risks of coronary heart disease and stroke. In addition, control of blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs and cholesterol lowering with statins reduce cardiovascular disease risk.23,24 Applying this knowledge in community programmes to prevent cardiovascular diseases would appear to be the best option for both developed and developing countries.""",3
"b'Sulfatide is a glycolipid that has been associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is present in the islets of Langerhans and follows the same intracellular route as insulin. However, the role of sulfatide in the beta cell has been unclear. Here we present evidence suggesting that sulfatide promotes the folding of reduced proinsulin, indicating that sulfatide possesses molecular chaperone activity. Sulfatide associates with insulin by binding to the insulin domain A8\x96A10 and most likely by interacting with the hydrophobic side chains of the dimer-forming part of the insulin B-chain. Sulfatide has a dual effect on insulin. It substantially reduces deterioration of insulin hexamer crystals at pH 5.5, conferring stability comparable to those in beta cell granules. Sulfatide also mediates the conversion of insulin hexamers to the biological active monomers at neutral pH, the pH at the beta-cell surface. Finally, we report that inhibition of sulfatide synthesis with chloroquine and fumonisine B1 leads to inhibition of insulin granule formation in vivo. Our observations suggest that sulfatide plays a key role in the folding of proinsulin, in the maintenance of insulin structure, and in the monomerization process.'",2
"b'An ultrasensitive method for analysis of polysialic acid (polySia) chains, using fluorescence-assisted high-performance liquid chromotography was developed. The new method is a substantial improvement of our earlier method in which the reducing terminal Sia residues of a homologous series of oligo/polySia hydrolytically released during derivatization reaction were simultaneously labeled with a fluorogenic reagent, 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) in situ. We first studied extensively the stability of oligo/polySia in the acid (0.02 M trifluoracetic acid) used for 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene derivatization under various conditions of reaction time and temperature, analyzing the hydrolytic products by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed electrochemical detection (HPAEC-PED). Then we optimized the reaction conditions to minimize degradation of the parent polySia while maintaining high derivatization rate. Using a DNAPac PA-100 column rather than a MonoQ column, baseline resolution of polySia peaks up to DP 90 with a detection threshold of 1.4 femtomol per resolved peak was achieved. The new method was used to analyze the degree of polymerization of a polySia-containing glycopeptide fraction derived from embryonic chicken brain, and the results were compared with those obtained by HPAEC-PED.'",2
"b'Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs or saposins) are essential cofactors for the lysosomal degradation of membrane-anchored sphingolipids. Four of the five known proteins of this class, SAPs A\x96D, derive from a single precursor protein and show high homology, whereas the fifth protein, GM2AP, is larger and displays a different secondary structure. Although the main function of all five proteins is assumed to lie in the activation of lipid degradation, their specificities and modes of action seem to differ considerably. It has recently been demonstrated that the action of the proteins is highly enhanced by the presence of acidic lipids in the target membranes. These results have some interesting implications for the topology of lysosomal degradation of lipids and may provide new insights into the function of these interesting proteins, which are ubiquitously expressed in the different tissues of the body.\r\n\r\nRecent studies indicated that the SAPs play an important role in the biogenesis of the epidermal water barrier, which has been demonstrated by the analysis of the skin phenotype displayed by SAP-knockout mice. The results obtained so far have led to some new insights into the formation of the epidermal water permeability barrier and may lead to a better understanding of this complex process.'",2
"b'At birth, virtually all peripheral CD8+ T cells express the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule, but healthy human adults accumulate CD28\x96CD8+ T cells that often express the CD57 marker. While these CD28\x96 subpopulations are known to exert effector-type functions, the generation, maintenance and regulation of CD28\x96 (CD57+ or CD57\x96) subpopulations remain unresolved. Here, we compared the differentiation of CD8+CD28brightCD57\x96 T cells purified from healthy adults or neonates and propagated in IL-2, alone or with IL-4. With IL-2 alone, CD8+CD28brightCD57\x96 T cell cultures yielded a prevailing CD28\x96 subpopulation. The few persisting CD28dim and the major CD28\x96 cells were characterized by similar telomere shortening at the plateau phase of cell growth. Cultures from adults donors generated four final CD8+ phenotypes: a major CD28\x96CD57+, and three minor CD28\x96CD57\x96, CD28dimCD57\x96 and CD28dimCD57dim. These four end-stage CD8+ subpopulations displayed a fairly similar representation of TCR V\xdf genes. In cultures initiated with umbilical cord blood, virtually all the original CD8+CD28bright T cells lost expression of CD28, but none acquired CD57 with IL-2 alone. IL-4 impacted on the differentiation pathways of the CD8+CD28brightCD57\x96 T cells: the addition of IL-4 led both the neonatal and the adult lymphocytes to keep their expression of CD28. Thus, CD8+CD28brightCD57\x96 T cells can give rise to four end-stage subpopulations, the balance of which is controlled by both the cytokine environment, IL-4 in particular, and the proportions of naive and memory CD8+CD28+ T cells.'",4
"b'In this study we describe the results of experiments in which a variety of totally synthetic luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) vaccines were assembled and examined for their abilities to elicit antibody responses and induce sterility in mice. It is shown that totally synthetic vaccines consisting of a 15 residue-defined T cell epitope and the 10 residue LHRH epitope not only induced high titers of antibody but also induced sterility. This effect did not appear to correlate with antibody titer, antibody isotype or comparative antibody affinity, but may be related to the length of time for which antibodies are present to exert their influence.'",4
"b'Whether astrocytes utilize B7:CD28 co-stimulation to activate T cells mediating CNS inflammatory disease is controversial. In this report, primary astrocytes and murine astrocyte lines, generated by immortalization at two different times, day 7 or 45 of culture, were examined for their capability to express B7 co-stimulatory molecules and to participate in B7:CD28 co-stimulation. Following exposure to IFN-{gamma}, primary astrocytes and astrocyte lines up-regulated MHC class II and B7-2 (CD86) molecules. However, B7-1 (CD80) expression was not inducible on primary astrocytes examined after IFN-{gamma} stimulation beginning on day 7 or on astrocyte lines immortalized on day 7. B7-1 expression was inducible on primary astrocytes examined later and could be up-regulated on astrocyte lines immortalized later. Unlike B7-1, temporal discordant expression of other co-stimulatory/adhesion molecules was not observed. Both B7-1\x96/B7-2+ and B7-1+/B7-2+ astrocyte lines were capable of stimulating proliferation of encephalitogenic Th1 cells, utilizing B7-2 for B7:CD28 co-stimulation. However, lines derived from immortalization later (B7-1+/B7-2+) were more effective in stimulating proliferation of naive myelin basic protein-specific CD4+ T cells. Astrocyte lines that expressed both B7-1 and B7-2 also stimulated Thp cells to secrete proinflammatory Th1 cytokines, whereas lines that expressed B7-2 only stimulated Thp cells to produce a Th2 cytokine pattern. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that individual astrocytes can differentially express B7-1 molecules, which may correlate with their ability to stimulate proinflammatory and regulatory patterns of cytokine production. These results suggest that astrocytes have potential for both promoting and down-regulating T cell responses, and that temporal differences in expression of B7 molecules should be considered when evaluating immune regulation by astrocytes.'",4
"b'Background The increased odds of stomach cancer among subjects with blood type A have been reported in epidemiological studies.\r\n\r\nAim To study the relation of family history of gastric cancer and ABO blood type with precancerous gastric lesions in a high-risk area for stomach cancer.\r\n\r\nSubjects and setting We examined 3400 adults aged 35\x9664 in a population-based gastric endoscopic screening in a county in China with one of the highest rates of stomach cancer in the world.\r\n\r\nMethods In this cross-sectional study, data on family cancer history, ABO blood type and other characteristics of the participants were obtained by interview and blood test. Responses were compared between those with the most advanced gastric lesions, dysplasia (DYS) or intestinal metaplasia (IM), versus those with chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) or superficial gastritis (SG).\r\n\r\nResults The prevalence odds ratio (OR) for blood type A relative to other types was 1.39 (95% CI : 1.12\x961.73) for DYS and 1.28 (95% CI : 1.06\x961.53) for IM. The OR associated with parental history of stomach cancer was 1.88 (95% CI : 1.20\x962.95) for DYS, but the numbers were too small to evaluate aggregation among siblings. The combined OR associated with blood type A and a parental of history of gastric cancer was 2.61 (95% CI : 1.59\x964.30) for DYS and 1.46 (95% CI : 0.93\x962.31) for IM.\r\n\r\nConclusions The findings suggest that genetic factors play a role in developing precancerous gastric lesions.'",3
"b'We assessed time-dependent neuronal activity accompanying learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An artificial grammar learning paradigm enabled us to dissociate activations associated with individual item learning from those involved in learning the underlying grammar system. We show that a localized region of right prefrontal cortex (PFC) is preferentially sensitive to individual item learning during the early stages of the experiment, while the left PFC region is sensitive to grammar learning which occurred across the entire course of the experiment. In addition to dissociating these two types of learning, we were able to characterize the effect of rule acquisition on neuronal responses associated with explicit learning of individual items. This effect was expressed as modulation of the time-dependent right PFC activations such that the early increase in activation associated with item learning was attenuated as the experiment progressed. In a further analysis we used structural equation modelling to explore time-dependent changes in inter-regional connectivity as a function of both item and grammar rule learning. Although there were no significant effects of item learning on the measured path strengths, rule learning was associated with a decrease in right fronto-parietal connectivity and an increase in connectivity between left and right PFC. Further fronto-parietal path strengths were observed to change, with an increase in left fronto-parietal and a decrease in right fronto-parietal connectivity. path strength from right PFC to left parietal cortex. We interpret our findings in terms of a left frontal system mediating the semantic analysis of study items and directly influencing a right fronto-parietal system associated with episodic memory retrieval.'",1
"b'In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a Golgi lumenal GDPase (ScGda1p) generates GMP, the antiporter required for entry of GDP-mannose, from the cytosol, into the Golgi lumen. Scgda1 deletion strains have severe defects in N- and O-mannosylation of proteins and glycosphingolipids. ScGda1p has also significant UDPase activity even though S. cerevisiae does not utilize uridine nucleotide sugars in its Golgi lumen. Kluyveromyces lactis, a species closely related to S. cerevisiae, transports UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into its Golgi lumen, where it is the sugar donor for terminal N-acetylglucosamine of the mannan chains. We have identified and cloned a K. lactis orthologue of ScGda1p. KlGda1p is 65% identical to ScGda1p and shares four apyrase conserved regions with other nucleoside diphosphatases. KlGda1p has UDPase activity as ScGda1p. Transport of both GDP-mannose, and UDP-GlcNAc was decreased into Golgi vesicles from Klgda1 null mutants, demonstrating that KlGda1p generates both GMP and UMP required as antiporters for guanosine and uridine nucleotide sugar transport into the Golgi lumen. Membranes from Klgda1 null mutants showed inhibition of glycosyltransferases utilizing uridine- and guanosine-nucleotide sugars, presumably due to accumulation of nucleoside diphosphates because the inhibition could be relieved by addition of apyrase to the incubations. KlGDA1 and ScGDA1 restore the wild-type phenotype of the other yeast gda1 deletion mutant. Surprisingly, KlGDA1 has only a role in O-glycosylation in K. lactis but also complements N-glycosylation defects in S. cerevisiae. Deletion mutants of both genes have altered cell wall stability and composition, demonstrating a broader role for the above enzymes.'",2
"b'The suggested role of Notch1 or its mutants in thymocyte differentiation and T cell tumorigenesis raises the question of how the different members of the Notch family influence distinct steps in T cell development and the role played by Notch ligands in the thymus. We report here that different Notch receptor\x96ligand partnerships may occur inside the thymus, as we observed differential expression of Notch1, 2 and 3 receptors, their ligands Jagged1 and 2, and downstream intracellular effectors hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 1 (HES-1) and hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 5 (HES-5), depending on ontogenetic stage and thymic cell populations. Indeed, while Jagged2 is expressed in both stromal cells and thymocytes, Jagged1 expression is restricted to stromal cells. Moreover, a differential distribution of Notch3, with respect to Notch1, was observed in distinct age-related thymocyte subsets. Finally, Notch3 was preferentially up-regulated in thymocytes, following the induction of their differentiation by interaction with thymic epithelial cells expressing the cognate Jagged1 and 2 ligands, suggesting that, besides Notch1, Notch3 may also be involved in distinct steps of thymocyte development. Our results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway is involved in a complex interplay of T cell developmental stages, as a consequence of the heterogeneity and specific expression of members of the Notch receptor family and their cognate ligands, in distinct thymic cell compartments.'",4
"b""The X-chromosome from the CBA/N mouse which carries the defective Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) allele (Xxid) has been introgressively backcrossed onto the plasmacytoma (PCT) induction-susceptible BALB/cAN. Inbred BALB/c.CBA/N-xid/xid (C.CBA/N) mice raised and maintained in our conventional colony were given three 0.5 ml injections of pristane and were highly refractory to PCT induction. Only one PCT was found among 59 mice followed for >=300 days. Twenty mice were examined at day 200 for foci of plasma cells in the oil granuloma. Ten mice had small foci of plasma cells, most of which were plasmacytotic, embedded in the inflammatory oil granuloma. In one there were multiple foci, but most of the mice had only one or two foci. F1 hybrid XxidY males derived from CBA/N females crossed to BALB/cAnPt were also resistant to PCT induction, while heterozygous and homozygous XY males were susceptible. C.CBA/N mice can develop extensive mucosal plasma cells as well as plasma cell accumulations in oil granuloma tissue, but the precursors of these plasma cells do not give rise to PCT in genetically susceptible hosts. The failure of C.CBA/N mice to develop PCT is probably due to the elimination of B cell clones that can be perpetuated by repeated exposure to thymus-independent type 2 antigens.""",4
"b'Background Atopy may impair ventilatory function, but results are controversial. We assess the association between individual reactivity to allergens and the level of baseline maximal one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), by smoking and respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\nMethods The 1472 participants (response 44.5%) of the five Spanish areas of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) who performed respiratory function tests, skin prick tests and/or specific IgE against common aeroallergens (e.g. mites, pets, mould, pollens) are included. Bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) was measured with a methacholine challenge.\r\n\r\nResults After adjusting for BHR and smoking, in addition to the other allergens, skin reactivity to Alternaria (\x96208 ml; 95% CI : \x96451, 35) and IgE antibodies against cat (\x96124 ml; 95% CI : \x96269, 21) and Timothy grass (\x96115 ml, 95% CI : \x96190, \x9640) were associated with a decrease in FEV1 in females. Among males, skin reactivity to olive showed the strongest association (\x96111 ml; 95% CI : \x96261, 38). The associations were stronger in females. Smoking modifies the association for Alternaria and cat (P for interaction < 0.05). While cat is associated with a decrease in FEV1 in current smokers (\x96190 ml), Alternaria (\x96336 ml) was associated among never smokers. The exclusion of subjects with asthma symptoms, or adjustment for respiratory symptoms, led to similar results.\r\n\r\nConclusions We conclude that immunoresponse to individual allergens (particularly outdoor) is associated with the level of FEV1, and this association occurred independently of asthma, and in smokers and non-smokers, which may be of interest in natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).'",3
"b'Background The objective was to investigate whether socioeconomic differences in fat intake may explain socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nMethods The Malm\xf6 Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study. The baseline examinations used in the present cross-sectional study were undertaken in 1992\x961994. Dietary habits were assessed using a modified diet history method consisting of a 7-day menu book and a 168-item questionnaire. A subpopulation of 11 837 individuals born 1926\x961945 was investigated. This study examined high fat intake, defined as >35.9% among men and >34.8% among women (25% quartile limit) of the proportion of the non-alcohol energy intake contributed by fat. The subfractions saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and the P:S ratio (polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids) were analysed in the same way. The uppermost quartile (75%) of total and subgroup fat intake was also studied. Socioeconomic differences before and after adjustment for low energy reporting (LER), defined as energy intake below 1.2 x Basal Metabolic Rate, were examined.\r\n\r\nResults No socioeconomic differences in fat intake were seen between the SES groups, except for self-employed men, and male and female pensioners. Approximately 20% in most SES groups were LER. The LER and body mass index were strongly related. The SES pattern of fat intake remained unchanged after adjustment for age, country of origin and LER in a logistic regression model. The results for the subfractions of fat and the P:S ratio did not principally differ from the total fat results.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study provides no evidence that fat intake contributes to the inverse socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular diseases.'",3
"b'We recently showed that circulating human CD8+ effector cells have a CD45RA+CD27\x96 membrane phenotype. In itself this phenotype appeared to pose a paradox: CD45RA, a marker expressed by unprimed cells, combined with absence of CD27, characteristic for chronically stimulated T cells. To investigate whether differentiation towards the CD45RA+CD27\x96 phenotype is dependent on antigenic stimulation and involves cellular division, TCR V\xdf usage and telomeric restriction fragment (TRF) length were analyzed within distinct peripheral blood CD8+ subsets. FACS analysis showed that the TCR V\xdf repertoire of CD8+CD45RA+CD27\x96 cells differed significantly from that of unprimed CD8+CD45RA+CD27+ cells. Moreover, in two out of six individuals large expansions of particular V\xdf families were observed in the CD8+CD45RA+CD27\x96 subset. CDR3 spectrotyping and single-strand confirmation analysis revealed that within the CD8+CD45RA+CD27\x96 population most of the 22 tested V\xdf families were dominated by oligoclonal expansions. The mean TRF length was found to be 2.3 \xb1 1.0 kb shorter in the CD8+CD45RA+CD27\x96 subset compared with the unprimed CD8+CD45RA+CD27+ population, but did not differ substantially from that of memory type, CD8+CD45RA\x96CD27+ T cells. These findings indicate that the CD8+CD45RA+CD27\x96 cytotoxic effector population consists of antigen-induced, clonally expanded cells and confirm that the expression of CD45RA is not a strict marker of antigen non-experienced T cells.'",4
"b'The cause of the mucus clearance problems associated with cystic fibrosis remains poorly understood though it has been suggested that mucin hypersecretion, dehydration of mucins, and biochemical abnormalities in the glycosylation of mucins may be responsible. Since the biochemical and biophysical properties of a mucin are dependent on O-glycosylation, our aim was to evaluate the O-glycosylation of a single mucin gene product in matched pairs of cells that differed with respect to CFTR expression. An epitope-tagged MUC1 mucin cDNA (MUC1F) was used to detect variation in mucin glycosylation in stably transfected colon carcinoma cell lines HT29 and Caco2. The glycosylation of MUC1F mucin was evaluated in matched pairs of Caco2 cell lines that either express wild-type CFTR or have spontaneously lost CFTR expression. The general glycosylation pattern of MUC1F was evaluated by determining its reactivity with a series of monoclonal antibodies against known blood group and tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens. Metabolic labeling experiments were used to estimate the gross levels of glycosylation and sulfation of MUC1F mucin in these matched pairs of cell lines. Expression of CFTR in this experimental system did not affect the gross levels of glycosylation or sulfation of the MUC1F mucin nor the types of carbohydrates structures attached to the MUC1F protein.'",2
"b""Background There is conflicting evidence on whether stress is a risk factor for breast cancer. The present study examined prospectively the relationship between stress at work and risk of breast cancer.\r\n\r\nMethods Participants comprised 26 936 postmenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study ages 46\x9672 who were in paid employment, and who had no previous history of cancer. Multivariate-adjusted regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between job strain (measured by the Karasek Job Content Questionnaire in 1992) and risk of incident invasive and in situ breast cancer.\r\n\r\nResults From 1992 through 1994, 219 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. No evidence was found for a relationship between job stress and risk of breast cancer. Compared with women in low strain jobs, the multivariate-adjusted relative risks of breast cancer were RR = 0.78 (95% CI : 0.52\x961.16) for high-strain jobs; RR = 0.76 (95% CI : 0.49\x961.17) for active jobs; and RR = 0.94 (95% CI : 0.67\x961.34) for passive jobs. Although job strain was related to less breast cancer screening among women in highly demanding jobs, it was not associated with tumour size.\r\n\r\nConclusions Job stress was not related to an increase in the incidence of breast cancer in the present cohort of nurses.""",3
"b'The effect of methylene blue on the disposition of ethanol was studied in rats and humans. Methylene blue increased the metabolism of [14C]ethanol to 14CO2 in isolated hepatocytes and in intact rats by 75% and 30%, respectively. In healthy volunteers, methylene blue did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ethanol and did not alleviate the ethanol-induced NAD redox changes as reflected by the increase in the [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio\r\nMany of the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption are the result of redox changes occurring in the course of the metabolism of ethanol. Oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and subsequently to acetate leads to an increase in the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio which contributes to the accumulation of fat in the liver of alcoholics (Lieber, 1994Go). An increased [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio may also stimulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The resulting increase in electron flow along the respiratory chain generates reactive oxygen species that have been implicated in ethanol-associated cell injury (Bailey et al., 1999Go). Consistent with this hypothesis, interventions to decrease the concentration of NADH during metabolism of ethanol decrease the generation of reactive oxygen species and the toxicity of ethanol (Bailey and Cunningham, 1998Go).\r\n\r\nThe rate-limiting step in alcohol metabolism is controversial. A number of experiments suggest that the activity of alcohol dehydrogenases is the key determinant (Lumeng et al., 1980Go; Braggins and Crow, 1981Go). Other data indicate that the rate of re-oxidation of NADH and thus the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio and the intracellular concentration of acetaldehyde influence the rate of disposition of alcohol (Cheema-Dhadli et al., 1987Go; Cronholm et al., 1988Go; Zorzano and Herrera, 1990Go). In support of this hypothesis, fructose in part alleviates the ethanol-induced redox shift and increases the rate of disappearance of ethanol from blood (Ylikahri et al., 1976Go; Rawat, 1977Go), an effect which is thought to be due to facilitation of intra-mitochondrial re-oxidation of NADH (Bode and Thiele, 1975Go; Rawat 1977Go; Crownover et al., 1986Go). Other investigators, however, have not been able to show a reduction of the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio by fructose (Mascord et al., 1991Go) nor a correlation between the elimination of ethanol and the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio (Ryle et al., 1985aGo; Morgan et al., 1989Go).\r\n\r\nMethylene blue, which is able to accept electrons from pyrimidine nucleotides and non-enzymatically transfers them to oxygen, has also been shown to prevent ethanol-induced redox changes and fat accumulation in isolated hepatocytes and HeLa cells (Cronholm, 1993Go; Galli et al., 1999Go). Redox changes, but not fat accumulation, are prevented by methylene blue in rats after long-term feeding of ethanol (Ryle et al., 1985bGo). Whether methylene blue modifies the metabolism of ethanol in humans is not known. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of methylene blue on the disposition of ethanol and ethanol-induced redox changes in humans and to compare it with the effects of methylene blue in isolated hepatocytes and intact rats.'",0
"b'N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a critical role in many cortical functions and are implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, the cellular expression of the NMDAR1 (NR1) and NMDAR2A and B (NR2A and B) subunits was investigated in the human cerebral cortex by immunocytochemistry with antibodies that recognize the NR1 or the NR2A and B subunits of the NMDA receptor. In frontal (areas 10 and 46) and temporal (area 21) association cortices and the cingulofrontal transition cortex (area 32), NR1 and NR2A/B immunoreactivity (ir) were similar and were localized to numerous neurons in all cortical layers. NR1- and NR2A/B-positive neurons were mostly pyramidal cells, but some nonpyramidal neurons were also labeled. Electron-microscopic observations showed that NR1 and NR2A/B ir were similar. In all cases, labeling of dendrites and dendritic spines was intense. In addition, both NR1 and NR2A/B were consistently found in the axoplasm of some axon terminals and in distal astrocytic processes. This investigation revealed that numerous NMDA receptors are localized to dendritic spines, and that they are also localized to axon terminals and astrocytic processes. These findings suggest that the effects of cortical NMDA activation in the human cortex do not depend exclusively on the opening of NMDA channels located at postsynaptic sites, and that the localization of NMDA receptors is similar in a variety of mammalian species.'",1
"b'Background Cardiovascular disease is rare in China, but there are few data on the prevalence of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in Chinese populations.\r\n\r\nMethods The ECG surveys were carried out in four Chinese population samples, in a total of 9666 adults aged 35\x9654 in Beijing and Guangzhou, China from 1981 to 1984. Twelve-lead resting ECG tracings were coded by the Minnesota Code.\r\n\r\nResults Prevalence per 1000 of abnormal ECG ranged from 77.4 to 209.8, and was higher for men than women and higher for Guangzhou than Beijing. Prevalence per 1000 of major abnormalities in Guangzhou was 29.8 for men and 78.4 for women, higher than the 18.4 and 29.6 for counterparts in Beijing. The ECG changes attributed in \x91Western\x92 populations to coronary heart disease (CHD), such as large Q waves (Minnesota Code 1\x961, 1\x962) and ST-T abnormalities, were similar between Beijing and Guangzhou men, but Guangzhou women had much higher prevalence of ST-T abnormalities than Beijing women. Other ECG abnormalities such as A-V block, left branch bundle block, and left ventricular hypertrophy were rare in people of both sites.\r\n\r\nConclusions Compared with similar data from the US, these Chinese populations had a relatively low prevalence of ECG abnormalities putatively related to CHD. This corresponds with the low incidence of CHD in the Chinese population. However, within the Chinese populations of this study, a high abnormality rate appeared in a population with low incidence of CHD and hypertension (Guangzhou women). Reasons why ECG abnormalities do not parallel prevalence levels of CHD and hypertension remain to be elucidated.'",3
"b'{lambda}5 associates with Vpre-B to form the surrogate light (L) chain. The phenotype of {lambda}5 knockout mice showed severe impairment of B cell development from pro-B to immature B cell stages. To investigate the function of the surrogate L chain at this stage, we restored expression of {lambda}5 to {lambda}5-deficient pro-B cell lines which were established from bone marrow cells of {lambda}5 knockout mice in the presence of IL-7 and a stromal cell line. Some of these lines are severely impaired in B cell development from pro-B to immature B cell stages as is seen in vivo in {lambda}5 knockout mice. Restoration of {lambda}5 protein by retroviral-mediated gene transfer into established {lambda}5-deficient pro-B cell lines induced rearrangement of the Ig {kappa} L chain genes after removal of IL-7 from the culture. Immunoprecipitation revealed that the restored {lambda}5 in the cell line is coupled with Vpre-B to form the surrogate L chain.

"b""Receptors for bioactive glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF) were demonstrated using a bioactive mutant of recombinant human (rh) GIF, which is comparable to the suppressor T (Ts) cell-derived bioactive GIF in its affinity for the receptors on helper T (Th) hybridoma cells. Both naive T and B cells in normal mouse spleen lacked GIF receptors. However, presentation of specific antigen to naive T cells resulted in the expression of the receptors on activated T cells. Furthermore, activation of small resting B cells with F(ab')2 fragments of anti-mouse IgM plus IL-4, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus IL-4 or LPS plus dextran sulfate induced the expression of the receptors within 48 h of B cell stimulation. It was also found that NK T cells freshly isolated from mouse spleen, but not conventional NK cells, expressed receptors for GIF. CD4+ and CD4\x96 subpopulations of NK T cells showed a similar binding capability. Mature dendritic cells derived from bone marrow did not bear the receptors. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the interaction between the bioactive rhGIF mutant and the high-affinity receptors was 10\x96100 pM, whereas inactive wild-type rhGIF failed to bind to the receptors. A bioactive derivative of rhGIF suppressed both IgG1 and IgE synthesis by purified B cells activated by LPS and IL-4, indicating that the binding of bioactive GIF to its receptors on activated B cells results in suppression of their differentiation.""",4
"b'The aim of the present study was to better oinvokedcharacterize the expansion of double-negative (DN) T cells in vivo in AIDS patients and to ascertain the discrepant response of an immunodepressed immune system towards two distinct mycobacterial infections. In a large cohort of HIV-1 seropositive patients with low CD4+ T cell counts (<100/mm3), we have recently reported on an expansion of DN T cells which was observed only in patients with disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection, toxoplasmosis and Kaposi sarcoma, but not in patients with tuberculosis. The potential differential {gamma}{delta} T cells response observed in vivo in AIDS patients with tuberculosis or disseminated M. avium complex infection was investigated by collecting the concomitant or the closest T lymphocyte counts performed within 2 weeks of bacterial diagnosis of 112 disseminated M. avium infection and 41 tuberculosis patients. The DN and {gamma}{delta} T cell percentages were different between the two groups (P < 10\x964) and the expansion of this compartment was found only with disseminated M. avium infections. An analysis of the variable {delta}2 segment versus pan-{delta} bearing T cells ratio disclosed a predominance of non-V{delta}2 T cells in these patients whose average values were identical in both groups. It is therefore concluded that the difference seen between these two types of mycobacterial infections concerning the DN T cells only involved the {gamma}{delta} T cells although the mechanism of their preferential expansion in disseminated M. avium infections remains a matter of speculation.'",4

"b""History is full of examples of public health, commerce and politics in conflict. In recent years attempts to protect UK egg producers, after the discovery of Salmonella enteritidis (phage type 4) in hens' eggs, strained previously good working relationships between medical and veterinary epidemiologists and ended the political career of a government minister who spoke out in defence of the public health. Against the background lessons of earlier high profile public health problems in the UK conflict should have been avoided when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) started. It might have been expected that its significance for human health could have been recognized and researched earlier. Public announcements about it could have been timely and clear. Unfortunately this was not the case and it looks as though similar mistakes are going to be repeated over genetically modified foods.\r\nIn December 1984 a UK farmer called a veterinary surgeon to look at a cow that was behaving unusually. Seven weeks later the cow died. Early in 1985 more cows from the same herd developed similar clinical signs. In November 1986 bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) was first identified as a new disease, later reported in the veterinary press as a novel progressive spongiform encephalopathy. Later still the causal agent of BSE was recognized as an abnormal prion protein.1 Since the outset the story of BSE has been beset by problems.""",3

Other characteristics of the menses, fertility, frequency of intercourse, and age at menopause appeared unaffected. More of the Yucheng women reported that one of their offspring had died during childhood (10.2% versus 6.1%, P < 0.05), and that they had decided to limit childbearing because of health problems (7% versus 2%, P = 0.01).\r\n\r\nConclusions These findings suggest that high level PCB/polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) exposure has some effect on female endocrine and reproductive function.""",3
"b""Background This study investigates whether cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status are independently associated with age at menopausal transition.\r\n\r\nMethods Menopausal status and risk factor information were collected prospectively from 1572 British women followed up since their birth in 1946, so far until 50 years. Cox's regression models were used to investigate the relationships of interest.\r\n\r\nResults Cigarette smokers started the perimenopause and reached the menopause earlier than ex-smokers and non-smokers. The relative risk for smokers compared with non-smokers was 1.31 (95% CI : 1.09\x961.56) for perimenopause and 1.63 (95% CI : 1.17\x962.27) for menopause. Body mass index was associated with the age at inception of the perimenopause only among smokers and ex-smokers, with underweight women having the earliest perimenopause. No association was observed between BMI and age at menopause. Smokers and underweight women were more likely than others to start hormone replacement therapy (HRT) before becoming postmenopausal. There was no effect of education or social class on age at inception of the perimenopause or age at menopause. Single women had an earlier perimenopause but the effect was confounded by parity.\r\n\r\nConclusions Smoking was independently related to an earlier menopausal transition, although the effect on inception of the perimenopause was particularly observed among underweight women. There was no independent effect of socioeconomic status. The popularity of HRT use in this cohort may have had an impact on the findings.""",3
"b'Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus results when > 90% of the insulin-producing \xdf cells in the pancreatic islets are killed as a result of autoimmune attack by T cells.

"b'Background Psychosocial work characteristics (job demands, control, support, job strain and iso-strain [high job strain combined with social isolation at work]) may be linked to cancer risk, by affecting cancer-related lifestyles like smoking, high alcohol consumption, low intake of fruits and vegetables and lack of physical activity.\r\n\r\nMethods Cross-sectional data obtained from 3309 respondents participating in an ongoing prospective cohort study in the Netherlands on psychosocial factors and cancer risk were used to study the association between psychosocial job characteristics and lifestyle. Information on job characteristics and risk factor prevalence was collected from 20\x9665-year-old men and women, through self-administered questionnaires. Multiple logistic and linear regression analyses were undertaken by gender, with adjustment for age and education.\r\n\r\nResults No differences in the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors for cancer were found amongst the psychosocial work characteristics studied. Moreover, little evidence was found for a relation between job (or iso-) strain and cancer-related lifestyles in multivariate analyses.\r\n\r\nConclusions The present study found no support for the hypothesis that job strain or iso-strain are associated with a cancer-related lifestyle. Further research on the role of other psychosocial factors\x97like personality or social support outside work\x97in mediating associations between job characteristics and lifestyle, is warranted.'",3
"b""Animals in their natural environments actively process spatiotemporally complex sensory signals in order to guide adaptive behavior. It therefore seems likely that the properties of both single neurons and neural ensembles should reflect the dynamic nature of such interactions. During exploratory behaviors, rats move their whiskers to actively discriminate between different tactile features. We investigated whether this dynamic sensory processing was reflected in the spatial and temporal properties of neurons in layer V of the `whisker area' in the rat primary somatosensory cortex. We found that the majority of layer V neurons had large (8.5 \xb1 4.9 whiskers) spatiotemporal receptive fields (i.e. individual cells responded best to different whiskers as a function of post-stimulus time), and that the excitatory responses of surround whiskers formed a spatial gradient of excitation that seemed to reflect the greater use of the ventral and caudal whiskers during natural behaviors. Analyses of ensembles of layer V neurons revealed that single-whisker stimuli activated a portion of layer V that extends well beyond a single cortical column (average of 5.6 barrel cortical columns). Based on these results, we conclude that the rat primary somatosensory cortex does not appear to operate as a static decoder of tactile information. On the contrary, our data suggest that tactile processing in rats is likely to involve the on-going interactions between populations of broadly tuned neurons in the thalamocortical pathway.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b""To evaluate the role of the medical profession in the Third Reich is a delicate and difficult task. Its participation in major atrocities was, to a large extent, hushed up and recent reports of medical opposition may, in many cases, be exaggerated. Much of the evidence has been destroyed or is not easily accessible. Furthermore, an objective view is potentially clouded by a number of issues related to the past or outlook of the evaluator. Finally, when looking at history with hindsight, there is the danger of arrogance in those who have not actually lived through it.\r\n\r\nThe following account therefore makes no claim to be either objective or complete. It is a personal analysis of a (non-Jewish) German physician who was born after the war and struggles to understand what happened.\r\n\r\nActive participation\r\n\r\nHistory of \x91race hygiene\x92\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, \x91Social Darwinism\x92 had spread throughout Europe. This theory assumed that nations, like animal species, fight for the survival of the fittest. The fittest nation would be the one that is genetically the \x91purest\x92. German proponents of Social Darwinism were to expand the theory significantly: Alfred Ploetz coined the term \x91race hygiene\x92 (Rassenhygiene), Ernst Haeckel was the first to consider the killing of \x91weaklings\x92,1 and the physician Fritz Lenz formulated his concept of racial inequality which directly influenced Hitler.2 Binding and Hoche finally lobbied for the extinction of \x91life unworthy of living\x923 suggesting that this could be a curative measure (Heilbehandlung) not necessarily requiring consent from its victims. Growing anti-Semitism and \x91Social Darwinism\x92 added together resulted in \x91race hygiene\x92. As the word implies, \x91race hygiene\x92 was essentially a medical issue.\r\n\r\nMedicalization of racism\r\nHitler frequently referred to the Jewish race in medical terms, as a \x91bacillus\x92, \x91parasite\x92 or \x91disease\x92. His followers adopted these medical analogies. In their minds, the \x91biological body of the German people\x92 (Volksk\xf6rper) was threatened by the Jews. Actions against Jews were promoted as acts of defence (Notwehr-Antisemitismus) in the all-deciding struggle for survival. On 15 September 1935, a law was passed that made marriages and extra-marital intercourse between Aryans and Jews illegal. It was termed \x91Law for the Protection of German Blood and Marriages\x92.4\r\n\r\nThe German medical profession bore and promoted the belief that curing patients was one thing but to heal the nation was incomparably more important: \x91The maintenance of a genetically homogeneous and healthy stock of the German people is the main duty of the German physician\x92.5 The vast majority of the German medical profession were willing to adopt the ideas of race hygiene; many even went further and perverted them into applied racism. Race hygiene had been initially developed by and was later entrusted to the German medical profession. To a large degree, the medical profession was not politicized but politics were medicalized.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary sterilization\r\nTo stop the \x91contamination\x92 of the German people by \x91inferior\x92 blood, forced sterilization was legalized on 14 July 1933, soon after Hitler took power in January 1933, through the \x91Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring\x92 (Gesetz zur Verh\xfctung erbkranken Nachwuchs). The quick move had been possible because of much preparatory work during the Weimar Republic, initiated not least by the medical profession.6 The law provided that (allegedly) handicapped individuals were to be identified, examined by a jury of \x91experts\x92 and subsequently sterilized. Some 200 \x91Genetic Health Courts\x92 were instituted. They ordered the involuntary sterilization of approximately 400 000 individuals. In 1934 alone, 28 286 men and 27 958 women thus became the victims of involuntary sterilization.7 The overwhelming majority of the medical experts' reports were later found to be of unacceptable scientific quality; almost all had recommended sterilization.6 It is estimated that 50 000 women were forced into eugenically directed abortion performed by German gynaecologists8 while, at the same time, the laws against voluntary abortions were tightened and the total number of abortions therefore declined.\r\n\r\nThrough accepting the role of experts in these juries, physicians had assumed an executive position within the National Socialist (NS) state.9 Leading proponents of race hygiene, however, believed that involuntary sterilization did not go far enough. In their view it generated human \x91ballast\x92 and an economic burden which had to be eliminated by other means. Thus, the concept of involuntary medicalized killing, wrongly termed \x91euthanasia\x92, was developed.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary euthanasia\r\nThe NS euthanasia programme secretly started in specialized medical departments in 1939. In theory, the programme was aimed at disposing of children suffering from idiocy, Down's syndrome, hydrocephalus and other abnormalities.10 Even though this programme was not specifically directed against Jews, it was sufficient for physicians to fill in the diagnosis \x91Jew\x92 to issue what in essence was a death sentence.11 At the end of 1939, the euthanasia programme went into its second stage by being extended to adults \x91unworthy of living\x92. Almost 100 000 (predominantly psychiatric) patients became its victims.12 The programme disposed of an estimated four-fifths of all psychiatric patients, and psychiatrists started wondering whether there would be enough patients left to keep their speciality alive.13\r\n\r\n\x91Action T4\x92 (named after the address of its Berlin headquarters in Tiergartenstrasse 4) was the organizational centre of the programme which was run by some 50 physicians. They sent out questionnaires to psychiatric and other hospitals urging doctors to name candidates for euthanasia. These patients were then transported to specialized centres where they were gassed or poisoned and subsequently cremated.14 Others were executed through lethal injections or starvation in psychiatric hospitals. Hitler himself discontinued the programme on 24 August 1941, following increasing opposition from both the general population and the clergy.11 The medical profession's protest to these activities (see below) was minimal and ineffective. Despite Hitler's official decree, the programme continued as \x91wild euthanasia\x92 without official authorization. Even in 1944 (i.e. shortly before the collapse of the NS state), the directors of psychiatric institutions received an appeal to relieve the pressure on beds by disposing of (Beseitigung) their patients.15 \x91Action T4\x92 amounted to medically supervised murder. Its true significance, however, lies in the fact that it was a pilot project for the \x91Final Solution\x92.13,14\r\n\r\nThe Final Solution\r\n\x91Without psychiatry, the holocaust would probably not have taken place\x92.16 The technical know-how of \x91action T4\x92 provided the basis for the anticipated total extinction of all Jews within the (then) expanding Reich. The link between \x91T4\x92 and the Final Solution was \x91Action 14f13\x92 termed after the file-number it obtained in the official files. \x91Action 14f13\x92 was initially designed to kill all handicapped and insane prisoners in the concentration camps.17 It grew into an elaborate programme of killing all individuals of Jewish or other non-Aryan blood. The diagnosticians who decided over life and death within this monstrous project were, according to Himmler's wish, experienced psychiatrists.\r\n\r\nAlmost without exception, those physicians who had gained experience in \x91action T4\x92 took charge of the Final Solution.11 The strategy for the anticipated extinction of the Jewish race was decided on 20 January 1942 at the Wannsee-Conference:... \x91in the course of the Final Solution, Jews should be brought... to work in the East... a majority will doubtlessly drop out through natural decimation... The eventual rest... will have to be treated accordingly...\x92.18 To be \x91treated accordingly\x92 meant to be killed.\r\n\r\nJews from all parts of the Reich were transported to one of numerous concentration camps. Those who had survived the transports were \x91selected\x92. The choice was either to go to the gas chambers immediately or to be exploited as labourers until too weak to carry on. This, in turn, also meant death through gassing.\r\n\r\nThe \x91selection\x92 was strictly a medical task, performed by teams of SS-doctors who formed an essential part of each camp. One of the camp doctors later stated: \x91There were the various officers, the doctor in charge and the unit commander. He had the task of making sure that everything remained orderly. I only saw it twice myself. The Kapos (camp inmates\x97criminals, political prisoners, and later, Jews\x97used by the Nazis to head the labour squads) would carry out a large pre-selection of children, very old women, and old men. There were additional selections carried out by certain personnel, after which the doctor had to decide. Now a lot depended on the size of the transport. If it was very large, the selection process was very superficial. If it was a normal-size transport, then things were done more thoroughly. The transports came at night, and if you had your normal duties during the day and then had to work extra at night, well...\x9219 While the pilot project (action T4) had killed thousands, the Final Solution eliminated millions under the trained guidance and supervision of physicians.\r\n\r\nNS \x91research\x92\r\nMany camps also engaged in medical research. At this stage misguided science (Social Darwinism) had been perverted into pseudo-science (race hygiene) which, in these research centres, was further degraded into criminal science. Typically the projects were run by SS-doctors with some affiliation to German medical schools. Often the research questions were determined through the \x91necessities of war\x92: What is the best way to survive in cold water? How can one survive on drinking seawater? How can one stop bleeding after injury? How can certain dangerous infectious diseases be prevented? Other research focused on the \x91purification\x92 of the German race. This included practical methods of sterilization and mass killing.20-22 Altogether there were over 60 different research projects carried out in the camps.23 The hallmark of all of the experiments was their unspeakable cruelty, unprecedented in the history of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe heads of research were often apparently normal SS-doctors with few signs of overt psychological pathology.24 The motivation of working for a \x91higher aim\x92 (e.g. for the best interest of the German nation) was a central theme which, in their minds, freed them from ethical obligations and humanitarian medical traditions. Many of the experiments were designed such that the \x91object\x92 would die at its conclusion\x97if only so that (s)he could be further investigated by the pathologist.\r\n\r\nResistance\r\n\r\n\x91It is also a sign of cowardice, of lack of moral courage when Aryan German doctors ignore this prosecution of Jewish doctors\x92.25 Indisputably, there has been relatively little effective German opposition against the horrors of the Third Reich. It has been estimated that, between 1933 and 1945, some 800 000 individuals (15%\x9620% women) were imprisoned for resistance to the regime.26 The succession of evil, as outlined above, remained largely unaffected by this opposition. Amongst the resistance that did emerge, only a small part was driven by the medical profession. Why? Should doctors, through their Hippocratic oath, not have been the ideal and natural profession to oppose? And should they not have been aware of what was going on? Several reasons are usually offered to explain this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nLack of courage, as quoted above, may be a contributing element but is unlikely to be a major factor. Doctors joined the NS party in higher percentages than any other profession. About 45% of doctors were party members (among teachers about 20% were members), 26% were SA members (about 11% teachers) and 7.3% were SS members (0.4% teachers).26\r\n\r\nGermans have often been characterized through their sense of duty, their patriotism (before 1945), their need for law and order and their high level of obedience. These qualities do not readily lend themselves to resistance against a dictatorship. Yet such arguments do not explain why German doctors offered less resistance than other professions (see below).\r\n\r\nDoctors might simply not have been aware of what was going on. Clearly not everyone knew everything and some may indeed have known very little. But generally speaking, the profession as such was in an excellent position to realize at least some crucial facts, particularly as not a small proportion was being published in official German medical journals. If doctors did not know, it must have been because they did not want to know.\r\n\r\nWith hindsight, the most plausible reason for the scarcity of medical opposition is the fact that any emerging resistance was radically crushed in its earliest stages. Within weeks after Hitler came to power in 1933 the German medical system was hierarchically structured with high rank positions being occupied by \x91trustworthy\x92 SS men.27 Most professional bodies, particularly those in natural opposition to fascism like the \x91Verein Sozialistischer \xc4rzte\x92, were dissolved. All doctors in key positions had to go through a special training programme at the \x91School of Leaders of the German Medical Profession\x92 in Alt-Rhese.28 Potential opponents were dismissed, forced into immigration or sent to the concentration camps.\r\n\r\nAt the Medical School of Vienna, for instance, some 80% of all medical staff were fired instantly after the NS take-over of Austria in 1938.29 During the first year of the Third Reich, no less than 116 professors and medical researchers were dismissed from German Medical Schools.30 Between 1933 and 1939, some 8000 academics from Germany and Austria emigrated to the US. Those who remained in office were so highly selected and conformist that \x91Gauleiter\x92 Streicher could, in a speech at the University of Berlin, ask: \x91If one were to assemble all the brains of University professors and put them on one side of a scale and place the F\xfchrer's brain on the other, which side do you think would outweigh the other?\x9231 Given this most effective prevention of resistance, it may even surprise that any opposition evolved at all.\r\n\r\nVarious forms of opposition or resistance may be differentiated and require to be judged separately: protest (oral or through publications), passive resistance, emigration (see above), resignation from office, industrial action, material support to organized groups, desertion from military service, refusal to follow orders, sabotage and assassinations. Only a few of these options were chosen by doctors.32\r\n\r\nThe subject of resistance against the Third Reich can be viewed as imbedded into a multi-dimensional framework. One dimension is time. Resistance before 1933 has a different meaning and importance than resistance at a time when the collapse of the Third Reich was imminent. Another dimension is personal motivation. Resistance for humanistic reasons must be seen differently from one driven by political motives (e.g. being a communist or socialist) which is different again from resistance on patriotic grounds (e.g. realizing that the war was driving Germany into foreseeable disaster).\r\n\r\nThe target of the resistance also deserves consideration. Clearly resistance against the dismissal of a Jewish colleague is a different matter from opposition against sterilization or euthanasia of (mostly Aryan) psychiatric patients or resistance against (Jewish) genocide. A further dimension is provided by the fact that different individual backgrounds lend themselves to different forms of and motivations for resistance. From these theoretical considerations it is clear that a given individual may have opposed one activity and participated in another (see below).\r\n\r\nBecause of the combination of scarcity of resistance, on the one hand, and complexity of inter-linked covariables, on the other hand, the following discussion will merely focus on an arbitrary selection of \x91case studies\x92 describing both individual and organized resistance in some of its guises.\r\n\r\nThe International Medical Bulletin (IMB)\r\nAt various stages of the Third Reich, several publications existed that more or less overtly criticized the NS regime and its actions: Neu Beginnen, Sozialistische Aktion Grenzecho, Der Deutsche Weg, Deutsche Briefe, Blick in die Zeit, Rhein Mainische Volkszeitung, Hochland and Stimmen der Zeit.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, the only medical publication to stimulate opposition was the IMB. The Prague-based journal was re-named in 1934 and published until 1939. It was the official organ of the International Medical Union, an outgrowth of the earlier Socialist Medical Association. Its editors believed that \x91fascism is the end of European culture\x92. Driven by socialist/ communist convictions they regularly published critical reports on Hitler's politics. It is unknown how many German doctors read the IMB or what its true impact was. Today the IMB's re-publication33 provides a rich and intriguing source of information.\r\n\r\nDoctor John Karl Friedrich Rittmeister\r\nIn 1941 Dr. Rittmeister (born 1898) was appointed director of the Psychotherapeutic Policlinic at the Berlin Institute of Psychotherapeutic Research and Psychotherapy. In this position, he helped many who were pursued by the NS regime for political or racial reasons. In 1941 he came into contact with the \x91Rote Kapelle\x92 (Red Chapel, a name coined by the NS regime to describe the communist leadership of this group). This organization was a heterogeneous gathering of individuals with different aims and backgrounds. Four of its members were doctors. Their activities range from the distribution of information to sabotage and intelligence work. Rittmeister became the co-author of \x91AEGIS\x92, the group's leaflets describing \x91the horrible tortures and atrocities\x92 of the Third Reich. He was caught in 1942, interrogated and tortured for 9 months and executed in Berlin-Pl\xf6tzensee on 13 May 1943.34\r\n\r\nOther German psychiatrists\r\nSeveral other German psychiatrists were opposed to the misuse of psychiatry as a murder weapon within the euthanasia programme. Leading figures were Karl Bonhoeffer and Karsten Japerson. Japerson was head of the Department of Psychiatry at Bethel, an institution that was sponsored by the Church. He relentlessly rallied against involuntary euthanasia and refused to co-operate in it. In 1940 he even filed a lawsuit for murder against the programme.35 Dr Japerson was instrumental in stimulating the Church's protest against euthanasia that eventually helped to stop its official part (see above). He repeatedly tried to organize the protest of the profession but in this he sadly failed. Other opposing psychiatrists mentioned by an eyewitness were: Ewald, Kuha, Creutz, Boestrom, Behringer, Braun, Kleist, Meyer, Willige, Creuzfeld.35\r\n\r\nDie Wei\xdfe Rose\r\nSeveral organized resistance groups existed during the Third Reich: Reichsbanner, Rote Frontk\xe4mpfer, Eiserne Front, Neu Beginnen, Rote Kapelle (see above) and the Europ\xe4ische Union. These may have had some medical input but \x91Die Wei\xdfe Rose\x92 was the only one predominantly related to medicine; it was an initiative of medical students. Its founder, Hans Scholl, came from a liberal family background yet was educated in the NS way. He had gone through a period of enthusiastic agreement with this regime, but soon became disillusioned with it. In discussions with other students, he and his sister Sophie began to formulate criticism which was motivated predominantly on moral and ethical grounds. The group was joined by Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, Traute Lafrenz and Willi Graf who were all medical students. Later they also admitted others unrelated to medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1942 the group began to anonymously mail critical texts to selected groups of key personalities in and around Munich: \x91Each word that comes from Hitler's mouth is a lie...\x92. The leaflets also spoke of the Germans' guilt through the Jewish genocide and asked why an entire people could watch apathetically while all this was happening. The group distributed a series of well-written, thoughtful pamphlets, but eventually they grew careless. On 18 February 1943 Hans and Sophie Scholl were caught distributing several hundred leaflets in the university. The intensity of the ensuing rage is evidenced by the fact that, by 22 February 1943, Hans and Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst were sentenced to death and executed the same day. Three more death sentences followed after a second trial several days later.34\r\n\r\nThe group had established contacts with similar-minded students in Hamburg. The \x91Wei\xdfe Rose Hamburg\x92 was founded in 1942. About 30 of its members were arrested in 1944 and 8 were executed.34 Other centres had been planned in Sauerbr\xfccken, Berlin and K\xf6ln.36\r\n\r\nProfessor Sauerbruch\r\nThis internationally acclaimed surgeon is seen by some historians as one of the worst NS doctors, while others acknowledge that he opposed certain issues of the regime.34 In several ways his attitude and behaviour can be seen as characteristic of large sections of the German medical profession.\r\n\r\nLike many doctors of that time, he was a patriotic nationalist and a monarchist at heart. Thus he was supportive of what he perceived as the NS regime's ambitions to restore Germany's honour, integrity and international standing. At the same time he was opposed to certain aspects of National Socialism. His national and international reputation provided him with unusual privileges and direct personal contact with men in the highest ranks of power, including Hitler himself.\r\n\r\nSauerbruch occasionally showed courage in directly opposing the NS regime. For instance, he personally prevented SA troops from putting the Swastika flag on the roof of his department.37 He protected or offered to protect Jewish doctors like R Niessen. Sauerbruch called Niessen, who had been his second man in the department, \x91bloody headed\x92 when he told him about his decision and motivation to emigrate.37 It was at Sauerbruch's house that liberally minded people could make contact.36 He also spoke his mind, for instance, about Hitler whom, during the final years of the Third Reich, he thought mad, or about the ill-effects of NS politics on medical educational issues. Sauerbruch protested against euthanasia in 194034 and he was a member of the \x91Mittwoch Gesellschaft\x92, an association of liberal intellectuals that was later declared illegal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sauerbruch became a willing instrument of the NS regime in many ways. His open and widely publicized letter \x91to the doctors of the world\x92 was an attempt to reassure the international community that \x91the national German government believes in peace and sees its highest task in safeguarding it\x92.38 He also accepted several NS honours like the title of \x91Senatsrat\x92, the \x91Nationalpreis\x92 (NS substitute for the Nobel Prize) and the post of Surgeon General of the German Army. The NS officials used his reputation to gain prestige and support for their own aims. There is little doubt that Sauerbruch was aware of this fact and knowingly let it happen or even profited from it.37\r\n\r\nIn retrospect it is easy (yet true) to say that Sauerbruch's attitude was based on a profound misjudgement of the NS State. He tried to oppose certain issues, yet at the same time he allowed himself to be used in many ways. Perhaps most importantly, he failed to do more to prevent the worst.39 Thus Sauerbruch \x91may aptly serve as a symbol for the ultimate dilemma of German medical scholars under Hitler, in the best and worse times\x92.2\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Reich\r\n\r\nOn 20 August 1947 the US military court pronounced the sentences against the defendants accused of crimes against humanity in the \x91doctors' trial\x92. Such action has no precedent in medical history. Death sentences were given to: Viktor Brack, Prof. Karl Brandt, Dr Rudolf Brandt, Prof. Karl Gebhardt, Dr Waldemar Hoven, Prof. Joachim Mrugowsky and Wolfram Sievers. Imprisonment for life sentences were received by: Dr Fritz Fischer, Dr Karl Genzken, Prof. Siegfried Handloser, Prof. Gerhard Rose, Prof. Oskar Schr\xf6der, Dr Hermann Becker-Freyseng and Dr Hertha Oberheuser. Two further doctors were given prolonged sentences of imprisonment and seven were declared not guilty.\r\n\r\nThe defendants found guilty at this tribunal were the ones known and apprehended at the time. After the tribunal, Mitscherlich and Mielke estimated that a total of 350 doctors had behaved criminally.22 In the light of data collected since this probably represents a gross underestimation. The more important point is that the German medical profession as a whole made these crimes possible. To put it in the words of Willi Graf, member of the Wei\xdfe Rose (see above): every single individual carries the entire responsibility.40\r\n\r\nThe medical profession's ensuing process of coming to terms with the participation in the worst medical violations of humanity in the history of mankind is neither honourable nor complete. Mitscherlich and Mielke's account of the \x91doctors' tribunal\x9222 was printed to be distributed at the Annual Assembly of German Doctors in 1948. Almost the entire circulation of 10 000 issues mysteriously disappeared before distribution took place. H-D S\xf6ling called the era following 1945 the \x91Fourth Reich\x92 indicating that within German medicine (too) much had stayed the same.41\r\n\r\nMany of the above-mentioned prison sentences were served only partly. Many doctors with a history of active anti-Semitism, several with a clear criminal record, were allowed to carry on working in their profession, some in high official positions.41,42 In Vienna almost all the perpetrators remained in or regained their positions.29 The Jewish colleagues who were forced to leave their country were rarely welcomed back. For many years, the subject of NS medicine was an absolute taboo (in Austria it remained so until the 1990s.29 A recent survey of German gynaecologists43 showed that 86% believed that the process of discussing the past had not even started.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the 1970s, the first German physicians of the new generation started researching the subject of NS medicine, they were viewed as \x91soiling their own nest\x92. Very few of their colleagues had (or indeed have) the insight to understand that such an activity is essential for \x91cleaning their own nest\x92. In the late 1980s, the German Medical Journal (Deutsches \xc4rzteblatt) finally published a series of articles on \x91Medicine in the Third Reich\x92. Its response in the letters section of the journal had a flavour of racism \x91that had reached the limit of being bearable\x92.42 The German professional body of gynaecologists took until 1994 to issue an official apology to the victims of NS gynaecology.8 Psychiatric patients who were sterilized during the Third Reich have never been officially acknowledged as victims. No compensation was paid on the grounds that, at the time, forced sterilization was legal.12 Some leading German psychiatrists even defended sterilization after the war.44\r\n\r\nIn 1987 a medical student wrote to Karsten Villmar, president of the German Medical Association asking how the profession could deem itself free of guilt while it still employed doctors who, many thousand times, had violated a basic axiom of physicianship. Villmar responded with the advice to \x91urgently fill the gaps in her knowledge regarding the function of a democratic liberal state\x92.41 The same Dr Villmar, who became the highest ranking German medical official in 1978, publicly announced that \x91only a minority of German doctors ... had spoilt the reputation of our profession.\x922\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to understand what had happened and how it was allowed to happen, the German medical profession turned the subject of NS-medicine into a taboo. This pathophysiology of silence climaxed in the destruction of documents. Even years after the Third Reich, investigators are confronted with a \x91wall of silence\x92 when attempting to research the subject.45\r\n\r\nWhen avoiding the topic was no longer possible, the German medical profession blamed everything on a few diabolically mad exceptions within their ranks. Self-criticism on a broad basis has so far not taken place. Only very few ask the question how the events between 1933 and 1945 have influenced present medical thinking in Germany and elsewhere. Today even reflective German medical opinion leaders take the view that \x91we cannot constantly go on feeling ashamed for others\x92. The \x91others\x92 have mostly perished now, and the German medical profession, by and large, has successfully avoided learning an important lesson from its own history.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThe participation in the \x91betrayal of Hippocrates\x92 had a broad basis within the German medical profession. Without the doctors' active help, the Holocaust could not have happened.16,22,46 Resistance even against the most outrageous crimes was minimal and was certainly not lead by physicians. After the Third Reich, the profession turned the subject of NS medicine into a taboo. When this was no longer successful, it promoted the myth that the atrocities were performed by a tiny minority of deranged outsiders. To the present day, the German medical profession has evaded meaningful introspection or self-criticism. Some of the questions that could have been addressed in this context are: What are the necessary preconditions for such atrocities to happen? How can they be prevented in future? Are there any early warning signals? In what way was the Germany of 1933 unique? Did (do) similar violations of medical ethics happen elsewhere? Where is the line between a doctor's responsibility to an individual and responsibility to society? Where are the limits of ethical research? Did (does) the (German) medical profession have too little respect for the human being? How can we increase this respect through medical teaching? What are the essential elements of a good relationship between the medical profession and the state?""",3
"b'The injection of psychoactive drugs, usually by the intravenous route, has been recognized for more than a century, and has become more widespread over recent decades (Golding, 1993Go; Derricot et al., 1999). We have been unable to identify any published examples of the recreational injection of alcohol. We describe here three cases in which intravenous injection of alcohol is reported.\r\n\r\nCase 1 was a 29-year-old, single, unemployed and homeless man, admitted to hospital for alcohol and diazepam detoxification. He fulfilled ICD-10 criteria (World Health Organization, 1992Go) for both alcohol and diazepam dependence. While reviewing his history of injecting illicit drugs (heroin and amphetamine), the patient mentioned that he had been injecting alcohol over the previous 9 years. He injected mainly vodka, sherry or whisky with approximately a twice-monthly frequency. His last injection had been 2 weeks before admission. He gave the main reasons for this use as the rapid effect and the enjoyment of the injection itself. The only side-effect he described was a burning pain at the site of injection.\r\n\r\nCase 2 was a 29-year-old, unemployed man, married with one child living in rented accommodation. He was admitted to hospital for alcohol detoxification. He fulfilled ICD-10 criteria for alcohol, opioid and benzodiazepine dependence. Heroin was the main drug injected. When questioned about intravenous injection of alcohol, he said that he had been using this method for 10 years until 1 year before admission. He injected mainly vodka with a frequency of four times per week. His main reasons for injecting were the rapid effect and enjoyment of the needle, particularly when heroin was not available. He described the only side-effect as redness and a burning pain at the site of injection.\r\n\r\nCase 3 was a 35-year-old single, unemployed man who lived in a hostel for the homeless and who was admitted to hospital for alcohol and methadone detoxification. He fulfilled ICD-10 criteria for alcohol and opioid dependence. He had injected various illicit drugs including heroin and amphetamine. When questioned about intravenous injection of alcohol, he admitted having used this method over a period of 3 years. He said that he had injected various alcoholic beverages, including beer, approximately once a week. His main reasons for injecting were the rapid effect and avoiding the smell of alcohol on his breath because his hostel prohibited alcohol use. The only side-effect he described was a burning pain at the site of injection.\r\n\r\nInformal discussions with colleagues across the UK, in both the alcohol and drug fields, indicate that only a minority of long-experienced clinicians remember what they consider rare, individual cases of claimed alcohol injection. Combined with the absence of previous published reports, this suggests that the injection of alcohol is a rare occurrence. The spontaneous description of intravenous injection of alcohol by case 1 led the authors to question a small opportunistic sample of injecting polydrug and alcohol users. The other two cases were identified within 4 weeks. To find three cases so readily may simply be a coincidence, but in English to \x91drink\x92 is a synonym for to \x91drink alcohol\x92. In practice it is therefore usual to ask questions about alcohol consumption that specify the oral route, for example \x91do you drink (alcohol)?\x92 Such questioning effectively precludes discussion of other routes of intake and may serve to minimize recognition of this high-risk behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe three cases were all male polydrug and alcohol users with histories of injecting drug use and current alcohol dependence. All were unemployed, two were currently homeless and all had required admission to hospital as part of treatment. Alcohol injection was not the main route of alcohol ingestion for any of the three users, but all had injected alcohol over a relatively long period (3\x9611 years). One possible explanation for initiating and continuing alcohol injection may relate to needle fixation. Pleasure from the act of injecting was described by cases 1 and 2, who also specifically described substituting alcohol for heroin. Another client (not reported) said that once, many years earlier, he had injected whisky rather than water, to stave off craving when heroin was unavailable. The rapid onset of effects was the main reason for continuing with intravenous use in all three cases. All described burning pain and local inflammation as the only side-effects, but other local and systemic hazards are clearly possible.\r\n\r\nTwo other unusual routes of alcohol ingestion have been reported in the media recently, snorting vodka among middle-class English club-goers (Mollard, 1998Go) and the use of vodka-soaked tampons by teenage girls in Eastern Finland (Anonymous, 1999Go). Intravenous injection has some common features with these other methods, e.g. rapid onset of effects, low doses required for intoxication, and the reduced likelihood of recent alcohol consumption being identified.\r\n\r\nThe advantages and disadvantages of oral consumption of alcohol are well-known to both the medical profession and the general public (e.g. Crawford et al., 1985). We hope that this report will stimulate interest among professionals to uncover the prevalence and the consequences of taking alcohol by the intravenous route.'",0
"b'The susceptibility of preimplantation stages of embryo development to preconceptional alcohol ingestion by females has had little investigation. We have recently shown that chronic 10% (w/v) ethanol intake by young female mice reduces the ovulatory response and impairs the quality of the oocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 10% ethanol administration for 30 days on immature female mice on the day of in-vitro fertilization (day 1) and on preimplantation embryo development. Female mice were ovulated on days 27 and 29 of ethanol treatment and in-vitro fertilization was performed 16 h post-human chorionic gonadotrophin administration (day 30). The oocytes from the ethanol-treated females inseminated with spermatozoa from control males, showed a significantly higher percentage of parthenogenetic activation compared to the control females. An increased percentage of fragmented oocytes was found after insemination, compared to control females. When the embryos were cultured, the percentage of 2-cell (day 2), 4-cell (day 3) embryos, and compacted morulae (day 4) was significantly reduced in treated females, compared to control females. On day 5, we found a highly significant decreased percentage of early and expanded blastocysts in the ethanol-treated females. The percentage of hatching and hatched (extruded) blastocysts was also reduced significantly in treated females at days 6 and 7 (blastocyst stages). An increased percentage of morphologically abnormal embryos was found on days 5 and 6 in ethanol-treated females compared with controls. We conclude that chronic moderate ethanol ingestion by young female mice results in decreased fertilization, embryo growth retardation, cleavage arrest, and abnormal embryo development in vitro.'",0
"b'Fragile-X, the main cause of inherited human mental retardation is associated with the absence of a recently identified fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Mice in which this protein is lacking due to a knockout (KO) mutation are reported to express altered dendritic spines on their cortical neurons compared with wild type (WT) controls. We have used tissue-cultured neurons to examine differences in morphology and synaptic connectivity between WT and FMRP-deficient mice. Hippocampal neurons taken from KO mice and grown in culture for 3 weeks have shorter dendrites and fewer dendritic spines than their WT counterparts. Also, KO cells tend to express fewer functional synaptic connections, which develop more slowly and produce smaller excitatory synaptic currents than WT controls. These observations may have important implications for the understanding of mental retardation associated with the absence of FMRP.'",1
"b'Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to magnetic transcranial stimulation (TCS) were recorded from right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles, sharing the same peripheral innervation but engaged in two different motor demands. In seven healthy and trained subjects, the latencies, amplitudes and variability of MEPs were investigated under the following, randomly intermingled, conditions: full muscular and mental relaxation; mental simulation of selective index finger or little finger abduction; mental non-motor activity (arithmetical calculation); and real motor task (little and index finger abduction). The whole procedure was performed by continuous audiovisual monitoring of electromyographic \x91silence\x92 in the tested muscles. The maximal facilitatory effects (= latency shortening and amplitude increase) on MEPs were induced by the real motor task. An amplitude potentiation of MEPs in both tested muscles was present during non-motor mental activity, in comparison to basal values. A further amplitude potentiation, without latency shifts, was confined to the muscle acting as \x91prime mover\x92 for the mentally simulated movement, according to the motor program dispatched but not executed by the subject. Similar results were also found in the F-wave, showing that mental simulation affects spinal motoneuronal excitability as well, although \x96 due to the lack of MEP and F-wave latency shift \x96 the main effect takes place at cortical level. The study shows that movement imagery can focus specific facilitation on the prime-mover muscle for the mentally simulated movement. This is mainly evident on FDI muscle, which controls fingers (i.e. the index) with highly corticalized motor representation'",1
"b'We have recently cloned eotaxin, a highly efficacious eosinophilic chemokine involved in the development of lung eosinophilia during allergic inflammatory reactions. To understand more precisely how eotaxin facilitates the specific migration of eosinophils, we have studied which adhesion receptors are essential for eotaxin action both in vivo and in vitro. Experiments using mice genetically deficient in adhesion receptors demonstrated that molecules previously reported to be involved in both leukocyte tethering/rolling (P-selectin and E-selectin) and in sticking/transmigration (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) are required for eotaxin action in vivo. To further elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in this process, we have used an in vitro transendothelial chemotaxis model. mAb neutralization studies performed in this system suggest that the integrins Mac-1 (CD11b/18), VLA-4 ({alpha}4\xdf1) and LFA-1 (CD11a/18) are involved in the transendothelial chemotaxis of eosinophils to eotaxin. Accordingly, the expression of these integrins on eosinophils is elevated by direct action of this chemokine in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that eotaxin-induced eosinophil transendothelial migration in vivo and in vitro relies on Mac-1/ICAM-1 and VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions, the latter ones becoming more relevant at later time points of the eotaxin-induced recruitment process.'",4
"b'Background Surveillance of infectious diseases is done in many countries. The aims of such surveillance include the detection of epidemics. In the present study, the possibility of detecting an epidemic in its early stage using a simple method was evaluated for 16 infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nMethods We used as an index the number of cases per week per sentinel medical institution in the area covered by a health centre in infectious disease surveillance in Japan in 1993\x961997. Periods of epidemics in health centre areas were determined according to the reported indices. The simple method used for detecting the early stage of an epidemic is that if the index exceeds a critical value, then an epidemic will begin in the following 4 weeks. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for this epidemic warning were evaluated for given critical values.\r\n\r\nResults When the specificity of the epidemic warning was more than 95%, the sensitivity was more than 60% in ten diseases, and more than 80% in four diseases (influenza-like illness, rubella, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and herpangina). The positive predictive value was between 15.6% and 31.4% in these ten diseases.\r\n\r\nConclusion The early stage of epidemics of some infectious diseases might be detectable using this simple method.'",3
"b'In some alcohol-related pathologies of chronic alcoholism women are more vulnerable than men. A consecutive sample of 62 chronic alcoholics was studied, 18 females and 44 males, aged between 28 and 69 years to assess the incidence and distribution of peripheral neuropathy with regard to gender. All patients underwent clinical and neurological observations, laboratory tests, and electroneurography. Total lifetime dose of ethanol (TLDE) and other risk factors for neuropathy (disease duration, age, nutritional status) were calculated and correlated to sural nerve sensory-evoked potential (SEP) amplitude. In 42 patients (67.7%), we observed the presence of clinical and/or infraclinical neuropathy, mostly axonal, in 29 males (65.9%) and 13 females (72.2%). In women, compared to men, TLDE and disease duration were significantly inversely correlated to sural nerve SEP amplitude, i.e. in women, SEP amplitude is significantly reduced in relation to TLDE and disease duration increase. These data indicate a higher sensitivity of females towards the toxic effects of ethanol, other than malnutrition, on peripheral nerve fibres.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to examine two questions: (i) which structures of the intact human brain change their activity with the direction of attention to left or right visual field; and (ii) how does activity in these structures, and in parietal cortex in particular, depend on the frequency of attentional shifts? Subjects were required to discriminate the orientation of peripheral gratings. The two main experimental variables were the attended hemifield (left or right) and the proportion of trials requiring a shift within that hemifield (20% or 80%). A detection control condition was also included. Behaviourally, subjects were less accurate and significantly slower when a trial required a shift than when it did not. Ventral and lateral occipital areas showed significantly higher blood flow levels contralateral to the direction of attention. Replicating previous work, there was also a significant main effect of the direction of attention in left lateral prefrontal cortex: blood flow levels were higher during leftward attention in comparison both to baseline and to rightward attention. This left frontal effect reached significance in single subjects in whom several activation sites could be distinguished within left middle and inferior frontal gyrus. Right and left parietal cortex were activated during both left- and right-field attention conditions, with a tendency for higher activity levels when attention was directed contralaterally. Contrary to the experimental hypothesis, however, parietal regions were not activated differentially by high versus low numbers of attentional shifts. The current experiment confirms that left frontal convexity is sensitive to manipulations of the direction of visuospatial attention. The results do not indicate a specific role of parietal cortex in attentional shifting.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Nurses in general practice (termed practice nurses) are an under-utilized resource for the detection and management of patients with alcohol misuse. However, little is known about their knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol use and misuse. We therefore conducted a postal questionnaire survey of 132 practice nurses in Liverpool (UK). The results of our survey (response rate 77%) show that a knowledge and skills gap exists in the delivery of effective advice on alcohol-related issues. Indeed, our results suggest that only one in two women and one in three men are receiving correct advice on sensible limits of alcohol consumption, this despite the fact that alcohol histories are taken. Further training was requested by most nurses to develop their screening and health promotion roles, and to become involved in the management of patients with alcohol-related problems in primary care. We suggest practice nurses should be encouraged to become involved in screening for, and management of, alcohol-related problems. However, it is important to ensure that the nurses receive appropriate training and have adequate back-up facilities from doctors and other workers involved in the care of patients with alcohol-related problems.'",0
"b'Alcohol-dependent subjects tend to report lower level of response to alcohol (LR) in the years before the disorder developed, compared to control subjects. The Self-Rating of the Effects of alcohol (SRE) score is a quick and valid retrospective estimate of LR. This study examined the associations between alcohol abuse or dependence and early experience of alcohol as measured on retrospective SRE score (relating to the first five times alcohol was imbibed), and the presence of alcohol abuse or dependence, in patients attending primary care. Higher Early SRE score (i.e. greater early tolerance of alcohol) was obtained in patients with an alcohol-related diagnosis than in patients without those diagnoses. Using a cut-off of 2 on the Early SRE score, the Early SRE score could discriminate between patients with and without an alcohol diagnosis with moderate to high sensitivity (84%) and modest specificity (57%).\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'New Zealand Black (NZB) mice spontaneously produce anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies (AEA) in association with splenomegaly, thus serving as a model for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Although these autoimmune traits are inherited as a dominant fashion, expression in F1 hybrids of NZB and most non-New Zealand strains is suppressed due to the contribution of wild-type modifying genes present in the latter strains. Using chromosomal microsatellite markers in the (C57BL/6 x NZB)F1 x NZB backcross progeny, we mapped C57BL/6 modifying loci for AEA production and splenomegaly. Generation of AEA was found to be down-regulated by a combined effect of two major independently segregating dominant alleles\x97one linked to D7MIT30 on chromosome 7 and the other linked to D10MIT42 on chromosome 10. Splenomegaly was modified mainly by a single C57BL/6 allele linked to D4MIT58 on chromosome 4. Thus, the autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the NZB strain is under multigenic control and a combined action of not only susceptibility but also modifying alleles with suppressive activities affects the outcome of disease features in the progeny. There are potentially important candidate genes which may be linked to the regulation of AEA and splenomegaly'",4
"b'The morphogenesis of callosal axons originating in the parietal cortex was studied by anterograde labeling with Phaseolus lectin or biocytin injected in postnatal (P) hamsters aged 7\x9625 days. Some labeled fibers were serially reconstructed. At P7, some callosal fibers extended as far as the contralateral rhinal fissure, with simple arbors located in the homotopic region of the opposite cortical gray matter, and two or three unbranched sprouts along their trajectory. From P7 to P13, the homotopic arbors became more complex, with branches focused predominantly, but not exclusively, in the supra- and infragranular layers of the homotopic region. Simultaneously, the lateral extension of the trunk axon in the white matter became shorter, finally disappearing by P25. Arbors in the gray matter were either bilaminar (layers 2/3 and 5) or supragranular. A heterotopic projection to the lateral cortex was consistently seen at all ages; the heterotopic arbors follow a similar sequence of events to that seen in undergo regressive tangential remodeling during the first postnatal month, as the lateral extension of the trunk fiber gets eliminated. Radially, however, significant arborization occurs in layer-specific locations. The protracted period of morphogenesis suggests a correspondingly long plastic period for this system of cortical fibers.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Yeast invertase contains 14 sequons, all of which are glycosylated to varying degrees except for sequon 5 which is marginally glycosylated, if at all. This sequon overlaps with sequon 4 in a sequence consisting of Asn92-Asn93-Thr94-Ser95 (Reddy et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem., 263, 6978-6985). To determine whether glycosylation at Asn93 is sterically hindered by the oligosaccharide on Asn92, the latter amino acid was converted to a glutamine residue by site-directed mutagenesis of the SUC2 gene in a plasmid vector which was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A glycopeptide encompassing sequons 3 through 6 was purified from a tryptic digest of the mutagenized invertase and sequenced by Edman degradation, which revealed that Asn93 of sequon 5 contained very little, if any, carbohydrate, despite the elimination of sequon 4. When Ser and Thr were inverted to yield Asn-Asn-Ser-Thr carbohydrate was associated primarily with the second sequon, in agreement with numerous studies indicating that Asn-X-Thr is preferred to Asn-X-Ser as an oligosaccharide acceptor. However, when the invertase overlapping sequons were converted to Asn-Asn-Ser-Ser, both sequons were clearly glycosylated, with the latter sequon predominating. These findings rule out steric hindrance as a factor involved in preventing the glycosylation of sequon 5 in invertase. Comparable results were obtained using an in vitro system with sequon-containing tri- and tetrapeptides acceptors, in addition to larger oligosaccharide acceptors.'",2
"b'We have recently identified two novel cysteine proteinase inhibitors from the skin of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), named salmon kininogen and salarin. In preliminary experiments, the proteins were found to be both N- as well as O-glycosylated. In the present study we show that both proteins carry biantennary {alpha}2,3-sialylated N-glycans. A very high amount of O-acetylated Neu5Ac units are present in the N-glycans, comprising about 60% di-O-acetylated species. Non-O-acetylated Neu5Ac make up less than 5% of the sialic acids in the N-glycans. A small number of Neu5Ac{alpha}2-8Neu5Ac structures were observed in the N-glycans as well. O-glycans from both proteins were recovered by reductive beta-elimination and were identified by mass spectrometric methods as mono- and disialylated core type 1 tri- and tetrasaccharides. The method used for O-glycan isolation prevented the identification of possible O-acetylation in the O-glycan-bound sialic acids, but O-acetylation was observed in one O-glycosylated peptide isolated from trypsin digest of salarin. The chemical nature of the sialic acid modifications was further studied by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene\x96derivatized sialic acids, revealing 7-, 8-, and 9- but no 4-O-acetylation. To our knowledge, these are the first observations of sialic acid O-acetylation in N-glycans on fish species and represent clearly the most extensive N-glycan O-acetylation described on any species.'",2
"b""The term \x91Cajal\x96Retzius cell' is applied to neurons of the human embryonic marginal zone which display, as a salient feature, radial ascending processes that contact the pial surface, and a horizontal axon plexus located in the deep marginal zone. These cells were first described by Retzius (Retzius, 1893Go, 1894Go) (see the cell labelled \x91Retzius, 1893' in Fig. 1Go). There is consensus that homologous elements are present in the non-primate neocortex, where their morphology is much simpler, as initially described in 1891 by Cajal (Fig. 2Go) (Cajal, 1891Go). In spite of several reviews (Duckett and Pease, 1968Go; K\xf6nig, 1978Go; Huntley and Jones, 1990Go; Mar\xedn-Padilla, 1978Go, 1990Go; Sup\xe8r et al., 1998Go), the definition of these cells has remained somewhat confusing, in part because Cajal and Retzius studied different species and different developmental stages, and also because their original publications have not been generally available. In fact, the cells drawn by Cajal (Cajal, 1899aGo,bGo, 1911Go) from his human material (see the cell labelled A, \x91Cajal, 1899' in Fig. 1Go) appear morphologically so different from those described by Retzius (Retzius, 1893Go, 1894Go) that they must belong to different, although possibly related, cell classes. The discrepancies in the observations by Retzius and Cajal could reflect vagaries of the Golgi method, or different magnifications or drawing techniques, rather than actual morphological differences in the cell types represented. However, recent data have confirmed the accuracy of the original observations. The morphological definition of Cajal\x96Retzius cells is thus based on observations of rather disparate cells that may not be homologous in all mammalian species.\r\nIn particular, DiI tracing visualizes cellular details in fixed human specimens in a Golgi-like fashion. This technique has given an exhaustive catalogue of Cajal\x96Retzius cell morphologies present in the human fetus, and their changes during different phases of gestation (Meyer and Gonzalez-Hern\xe1ndez, 1993) (Fig. 1Go, cells labelled \x91Meyer, 1993'). Similarly, immunohistochemical work in human fetuses (Verney and Derer, 1995Go; Belichenko, 1995; Uylings and Delalle, 1997Go) as well as in non-human primates (Huntley and Jones, 1990Go; Hendrickson et al., 1991Go; Yan et al., 1995aGo,bGo) confirmed the descriptions by Cajal and Retzius (see below).\r\nThe currently prevailing view on Cajal\x96Retzius cells is based on the hypothesis of the dual origin of the cerebral cortex, initially proposed by Mar\xedn-Padilla (Mar\xedn-Padilla, 1971Go, 1972Go, 1978Go). It holds that the cerebral cortex derives from an early neural network, originally named the \x91primordial plexiform layer' (Mar\xedn-Padilla, 1971Go, 1972Go, 1978Go) and subsequently renamed the \x91preplate' (Rickmann and Wolff, 1981Go). The preplate contains mutually interconnected early generated neurons and is split apart by the cortical plate (CP) that will contribute layers II\x96VI, with the result that preplate derivatives settle superficially, in the marginal zone (MZ), or future layer I, as well as deeply, in the subplate, at the interface with the future white matter. It is generally inferred that the derivatives of the preplate that settle in the MZ are the Cajal\x96Retzius cells. According to Mar\xedn-Padilla, early Cajal\x96Retzius cells send axonal projections into the subplate. The descending axons, together with ascending fibers from Martinotti-type cells, are essential components of his concept of a primordial cortical neuropil (Mar\xedn-Padilla, 1971Go, 1978Go, 1998Go).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of an early birth of neurons in the MZ and subplate, originating from the preplate, followed by the division of the preplate when the CP appears, has been amply confirmed (K\xf6nig et al., 1977Go; Rickmann et al., 1977; Raedler and Raedler, 1978Go; Luskin and Shatz, 1985Go; Chun and Shatz, 1989Go; Wood et al., 1992Go). These studies provided unequivocal evidence that the oldest neurons of the cortex do in fact settle above the cortical plate, in layer I, as well as below, in the superficial white matter. However, while simple and attractive, the inference that the preplate elements in the MZ correspond to the classical Cajal\x96 Retzius cells is far from obvious. In the present paper, we wish to propose that this view is too restricted to account for some observations in the human and rodent developing cortex (Meyer and Gonzalez-Hernandez, 1993Go; Meyer and Goffinet, 1998Go; Meyer et al., 1998Go, 1999Go; Soria et al., 1998Go; Soria and Fair\xe9n, 1999Go) and needs to be significantly modified.\r\n\r\nRecently, so-called Cajal\x96Retzius cells were shown to secrete Reelin (Reln), the product of the reeler gene (Ogawa et al. 1995Go; D'Arcangelo et al., 1995Go, 1997Go; Ikeda and Terashima, 1997Go; Schiffmann et al., 1997Go; Alc\xe1ntara et al., 1998Go; Meyer and Goffinet, 1998Go; Meyer et al., 1998Go). The availability of new markers provides an opportunity to study in more detail the typology of developing neurons in the neocortical marginal zone. We studied brains from various species, namely human fetuses (Meyer and Goffinet, 1998Go), pre- and postnatal mice and rats (Meyer and Fair\xe9n, 1996; Meyer et al., 1998Go; Soria et al., 1998Go) and late fetal and postnatal kittens (unpublished). We used anti-Reelin antibodies (de Bergeyck et al., 1998Go), as well as other immunohistochemical markers such as calretinin, calbindin, GABA and GAD antibodies, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) birthdating. Our data show that Reln is expressed by different neuronal populations in the developing marginal zone MZ, some of which appear quite different from the cells described in the classical studies of Cajal and Retzius. Although some preplate derivatives do express Reln, others do not. Furthermore, at variance with the dual-origin hypothesis of Mar\xedn-Padilla, we have observed that a substantial contingent of Reln-positive cells in the MZ seem to derive from a discrete sector of the neuroepithelium in the basal forebrain and to invade the MZ by tangential subpial migration. In addition, some early-born neurons in the marginal zone, which do not express Reln, give rise to the first pioneer axon projections of the embryonic cortex reaching as far as the lateral ganglionic eminence before subplate neurons are generated; we named these cells \x91pioneer neurons' of the MZ (Meyer et al., 1998Go). Together with subplate cells, these pioneers contribute an early efferent projection from the preplate.\r\n\r\nThese data suggest that it would be inappropriate and confusing to label all neurons in the MZ as \x91Cajal\x96Retzius cells'. We would rather define \x91Cajal\x96Retzius cells' loosely, as the family of Reln-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the marginal zone, and reserve the term of pioneer neurons for the early, Reln-negative preplate derivatives that settle in the MZ and project to sub-cortical levels. This terminology avoids confusion and reflects the complexity of early corticogenesis.\r\n\r\nThe early descriptions by Cajal and Retzius referred to the neocortex. Similarly, the present account deals with the neo-cortical MZ, even though the term \x91Cajal\x96Retzius cell' has been extended to neurons in the marginal zone of the hippocampus (Soriano et al., 1994Go; Drakew et al., 1998Go; Sup\xe8r et al., 1998Go; Alc\xe1ntara et al., 1998Go). Although these hippocampal neurons do express Reln (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995Go; Ikeda and Terashima, 1997Go; Drakew et al., 1998Go), studies of the fetal human hippocampus suggest that their development is largely independent from that of the neocortical Cajal\x96Retzius cell family (Meyer, 1998Go).\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a relatively abundant plasma protein which we have shown previously inhibits the formation of insoluble immune complexes (IC). In this study we examined the ability of HRG to regulate the binding of monomeric IgG and IC to monocytes. Initial studies demonstrated that HRG interacts with Fc{gamma}RI on the monocytic cell line THP1 and blocks the binding of monomeric IgG to these cells. However, despite totally blocking the binding of monomeric IgG to Fc{gamma}RI, pre-incubation of THP1 cells with HRG had no effect on the binding of IC to these cells. In contrast, depending on the HRG:IgG molar ratio, pre-incubation of monomeric IgG with HRG resulted in either enhanced or reduced IgG binding to Fc{gamma}RI. Similarly, under certain highly defined conditions, incorporation of HRG in IgG-containing IC potentiated the binding of IC to THP1 cells. The key conditions involved incorporating approximately equimolar concentrations of HRG and IgG in the IC, the IC being formed at a near equivalence antigen:antibody ratio and usually physiological concentration (20 \xb5M) of Zn2+ being present. Collectively these observations indicate that HRG is an important regulator of IC uptake by monocytes. Thus HRG can interact with Fc{gamma}RI on monocytes and block monomeric IgG binding, whereas when incorporated in IgG containing IC, HRG can enhance the uptake of IC by monocytes, probably via its heparan sulfate binding domain.'",4
"b'Genes essential for the production of a linear, bacterial (1->3)-[beta]-glucan, curdlan, have been cloned for the first time from Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749. The genes occurred in two, nonoverlapping, genomic fragments that complemented different sets of curdlan(crd)-deficient transposon-insertion mutations. These were detected as colonies that failed to stain with aniline blue, a (1->3)-[beta]-glucan specific dye. One fragment carried a biosynthetic gene cluster (locus I) containing the putative curdlan synthase gene, crdS, and at least two other crd genes. The second fragment may contain only a single crd gene (locus II). Determination of the DNA sequence adjacent to several locus I mutations revealed homology to known sequences only in the cases of crdS mutations. Complete sequencing of the 1623 bp crdS gene revealed highest similarities between the predicted CrdS protein (540 amino acids) and glycosyl transferases with repetitive action patterns. These include bacterial cellulose synthases (and their homologs), which form (1->4)-[beta]-glucans. No similarity was detected with putative (1->3)-[beta]-glucan synthases from yeasts and filamentous fungi. Whatever the determinants of the linkage specificity of these [beta]-glucan synthases might be, these results raise the possibility that (1->3)-[beta]-glucans and (1->4)-[beta]-glucans are formed by related catalytic polypeptides.\r\nExtracellular homo- and hetero-polysaccharides are produced by many bacterial species (Leigh and Coplin, 1992; Sutherland, 1993). The best known is the (1->4)-[beta]-glucan, cellulose, from Acetobacter xylinum, also produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium spp., Sarcina ventriculi, and other species (Ross et al., 1991). Members of the Rhizobiaceae, including Agrobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhizobium, synthesize linear and cyclic (1->2)-[beta]-glucans and cyclic (1->3, 1->6)-[beta]-glucans (Breedveld and Miller, 1994).\r\n\r\nA linear (1->3)-[beta]-glucan, known as curdlan, is produced by an Agrobacterium sp. and some other bacteria (Harada and Harada, 1996). This polysaccharide is obtained in good yields in an insoluble, microfibrillar form when the Agrobacterium is grown on glucose-rich medium, and its synthesis is induced on depletion of the nitrogen source (Phillips and Lawford, 1983). The (1->3)-[beta]-glucan molecules in native curdlan probably exist as an association of single helical chains (Kasai and Harada, 1980). When suspensions of native curdlan are heated at 55-70\xb0C, a low set gel is produced. In this state, x-ray diffraction (Okuyama et al., 1991) and 13C NMR (Saito et al., 1977) studies have demonstrated that most of the molecules are single chain helices but some triple-stranded helices may also occur. On heating to higher temperatures, the strength of the gel increases and the (1->3)-[beta]-glucan molecules are present as triple-stranded helices (Kasai and Harada, 1980). The unique gel forming properties of curdlan have led to its use as a food texture modifier (Harada et al., 1993; Harada and Harada, 1996) and as an enhancer of flow properties of concrete (Sakamoto et al., 1991).\r\n\r\nStructurally comparable (1->3)-[beta]-glucans are found in the walls of yeasts and certain groups of filamentous fungi (Stone and Clarke, 1992; Cid et al., 1995) and as storage polysaccharides in brown algae (laminarin), euglenoids (paramylon), chrysophytes (leucosin) and some fungi (cellulin, mycolaminarin, pachyman; Stone and Clarke, 1992). Higher plants also produce a linear (1->3)-[beta]-glucan, callose, in the cell plate at the earliest stage of cell wall deposition, and in special walls in cells of reproductive tissues (e.g., pollen mother cells, pollen tubes) as well as forming deposits on the plasma membrane in abiotic and biotic stress (Stone and Clarke, 1992).\r\n\r\nCurdlan is specifically stained by the triphenylmethane dye aniline blue (Nakanishi et al., 1974) and by the aniline blue fluorochrome (Evans et al., 1984) as are other (1->3)-[beta]-glucans such as yeast (Saccharomyces cereviseae) glucan, pachyman (Poria cocus; Nakanishi et al., 1974), and callose (Vitis vinifera; Aspinall and Kessler, 1957). Aniline blue has thus been used both to detect curdlan production by bacteria grown on agar medium (Nakanishi et al., 1974) and to identify mutants unable to produce curdlan (Nakanishi et al., 1976).\r\n\r\nA considerable body of biochemical and molecular genetic information is available concerning bacterial cellulose synthesis, including the intriguing indication that the mechanisms may differ between A.xylinum (Saxena et al., 1991; Saxena and Brown, 1995) and A.tumefaciens (Matthysse et al., 1995a) even though these bacteria encode highly homologous cellulose synthases. Nothing is known about the molecular genetics of curdlan biosynthesis in bacteria or callose synthesis in higher plants, but there is growing information about the genes required for (1->3)-[beta]-glucans produced by yeasts and filamentous fungi (Douglas et al., 1994; Inoue et al., 1995; Mazur et al., 1995; Kelly et al., 1996; Mio et al., 1997). Thus, knowledge of the synthesis and secretion of curdlan is also of considerable interest from a comparative viewpoint. In addition, this information might prove useful in the isolation of plant (1->3)-[beta]-glucan synthase gene homologues as has been achieved for plant cellulose synthase genes (Pear et al., 1996). As a first stage in such a study of curdlan, we have cloned several essential curdlan genes from the industrially used strain, Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749 (formerly Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes; Harada et al., 1966). The genes occur in two nonoverlapping genomic clones that complement the mutations in curdlan-deficient insertion-mutants. The nucleotide sequence of one gene, crdS, was determined and, based on its homology with known [beta]-glycan synthases, is proposed to encode the (1->3)-[beta]-glucan (curdlan) synthase catalytic protein.'",2
"b'We have described recently that anti-CD44s, anti-CD44v6 and anti-CD44v7 interfere with delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Yet, TNBS-induced colitis can be cured only by anti-CD44v7. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the divergent functional activities of CD44v6 and CD44v7 we explored their contribution to lymphocyte activation in vivo and in vitro. CD44v6 and CD44v7 are distinctly expressed on subpopulations of activated lymphocytes. Expression of CD44v6 is mainly restricted to T cell blasts. CD44v7 has been detected on CD4+ cells, B cells and monocytes. Mitogenic and antigenic stimulation of lymphocytes in vitro was impaired in the presence of anti-CD44v6 and anti-CD44v7. Accordingly, anti-CD44v6 and anti-CD44v7 mitigated the DTH reaction in 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene-sensitized and challenged mice. However, the seemingly similar effects of CD44v6- and CD44v7-specific antibodies resulted from different activities. Anti-CD44v6 treatment led to a down-regulation of IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} production predominantly by CD8+ cells. In anti-CD44v7-treated mice expression of IL-12 was decreased. Elevated levels of IL-10 accompanied this reduction. The latter resulted from an anti-CD44v7-mediated blockade of interactions between CD4+ cells and monocytes as well as an active triggering of B cells. Thus, anti-CD44v6 and anti-CD44v7 interfere with lymphocyte activation at very specific points. CD44v6 functions predominantly at the T cell level. CD44v7 influences production of proinflammatory cytokines by B cells as well as an interaction between CD4+ cells and antigen-presenting cells. As CD44 isoforms do not differ in their intracytoplasmatic tail, the distinct activities must result from expression on different leukocyte subsets and interactions with distinct ligands.'",4
"b'Ig class switch recombination occurs in B lymphocytes upon activation, and is targeted to distinct switch (S) regions by cytokine-mediated induction of switch transcripts spanning the entire S region and the adjacent constant region gene segments. Using a novel type of switch recombination substrate, constructed according to the intron\x96exon structure of the IgH locus, but with heterologous elements, we here have tested the structural requirements for targeting and the kinetics of switch recombination in activated primary murine B cells. When transfected at various times after activation, up to 10% of the transfected B cells perform recombination of the substrate within 12 h. Switch recombination in primary B cells is restricted to the first 72 h after onset of activation, then rapidly decreases to background levels, as obtained in plasmacytoma cells or with substrates carrying no S region sequences. In terms of structural requirements, switch recombination is targeted to any transcription unit that contains an intronic S region and depends on processing of the primary transcript by splicing.'",4
"b""Thyroid follicular cells (TFC) in Graves' disease (GD) hyperexpress HLA class I and express ectopic HLA class II molecules, probably as a consequence of cytokines produced by infiltratingT cells. This finding led us to postulate that TFC could act as antigen-presenting cells, and in this way be responsible for the induction and/or maintenance of the in situ autoimmune T cell response. Invariant chain (Ii) and HLA-DM molecules are implicated in the antigen processing and presentation by HLA class II molecules. We have investigated the expression of these molecules by TFC from GD glands. The results demonstrate that class II+ TFC from GD patients also express Ii and HLA-DM, and this expression is increased after IFN-{gamma} stimulation. The level of HLA-DM expression by TFC was low but sufficient to catalyze peptide loading into the HLA class II molecules and form stable HLA class II-peptide complexes expressed at the surface of TFC. These results have implications for the understanding of the possible role of HLA class II+ TFC in thyroid autoimmune disease.""",4
"b'Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase is a surface antigen of this bacterial pathogen, which causes significant mortality and morbidity in human populations worldwide. The primary function of this enzyme is the degradation of hyaluronan, a major component of the extracellular matrix of the tissues of practically all vertebrates. The enzyme uses a processive mode of action to degrade hyaluronan to a final product, an unsaturated disaccharide hyaluronan unit. This catalysis proceeds via a five-step proton acceptance and donation mechanism that includes substrate binding, catalysis, release of the disaccharide product, translocation of the remaining hyaluronan substrate, and proton exchange with microenvironment.\r\n\r\nBased on the analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the native enzyme and its complexes with hexasaccharide substrate and disaccharide product, several residues have been chosen for mutation studies. These mutated residues included the catalytic residues Asn349, His399, Tyr408, and residues responsible for substrate binding and translocation, Arg243 and Asn580. The comparison of the kinetic properties of the wild-type with the mutant enzymes allowed for the characterization of every mutant and the correlation of the kinetic properties of the enzyme with its structure. The comparison of the wild-type hyaluronate lyase with other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, the hydrolases endonuclease and glucoamylase, shows striking similarity of Kms for all of these different enzymes.'",2
"b'January 2000 will mark, among many other events, the beginning of the 10th volume of Cerebral Cortex. On this occasion we are pleased to report some good news as well as to announce several modifications in the publication of the journal. First, starting in January, Cerebral Cortex will be published monthly. The increase from 8 to 12 issues hopefully will alleviate the backlog that has been developing due to a steady increase in submissions. The larger number of issues will not only allow papers to be published more rapidly, but will also enable continued publication of Special Issues in each volume. Although, judging by the number of hits, the electronic full-text online version has been a success, we encourage all our contributors and subscribers to suggest further improvements.\r\n\r\nA second bit of good news is that Cerebral Cortex has risen to an admirable impact factor of 7.4, according to the Institute of Scientific Information\x92s 1999 SCI Journal Citation Reports. This places it within the \xe9lite of specialized journals and ahead of many well-established neuroscience periodicals. Subscriptions have been increasing steadily and both the submissions and readership have broad international representation.\r\n\r\nA third point is that Cerebral Cortex continues to represent all areas of the cerebral cortex and all levels of analysis, ranging from genes and molecules to anatomy, function and theory. The journal has published significant papers on cortical development, aging and evolution as well as on neurological and mental diseases. Our aim is to broaden the range still further to encompass more cellular, circuit and in vitro approaches as well as in vivo research in both experimental animals and humans.  Finally, our Special Issues continue to be very successful and the last two, \x91Cortical Circuits\x92 edited by David McCormick and \x91Genetic Control of Cortical Development\x92 edited by John Rubenstein and Pasko Rakic, have helped to increase interest in these topics. Two special issues that will appear during the coming year are \x91The Mysterious Orbitofrontal Cortex\x92 edited by Camen Cavada and Wolfram Shultz, and \x91Cortical Dendrites\x92 edited by Ralph Niznik and Patricia Goldman-Rakic.\r\n\r\nIn each of the past four years, there has been an annual increase of over 25% in regular submissions. Although this increase is a sign of the journal\x92s health, this year it has forced us to reject over 50% of manuscripts as well as to hold many excellent papers in the pipeline. Editorial decisions and final selection are based on reviews by two or three respected experts in the field. Although the influx of manuscripts occurred in all subfields, Cerebral Cortex has experienced a major increase of papers in the field of neurobiology and noninvasive imaging of the human brain. In response, a Section Editor for this field will be selected in the coming year.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead to the next decade, Cerebral Cortex will try to achieve even higher standards and strive to capture the excitement in this important and fast growing field. Scientists in this field are interested in complex issues and exploring these issues at multiple levels of analysis. With selection of high-quality papers at the conceptual and methodological edge, as well as outstanding reproduction of illustrations, Cerebral Cortex has become an essential resource in our field.  However, the journal cannot prosper and advance without enthusiasts of this subject of unending depth and interest \x97 the organ that holds the secrets of human evolution.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The 36 kDa vesicular-integral membrane protein, VIP36, has been originally isolated from MDCK cells as a component of glycolipid-enriched detergent-insoluble complexes containing apical marker proteins, and its luminal domain shows homology to leguminous plant lectins and ERGIC-53. As the first step to identify the functional role of VIP36, the carbohydrate binding specificity of VIP36 was investigated using a fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase and luminal domain of VIP36 (Vip36). It was found that VIP36 recognizes high-mannose type glycans containing [alpha]1->2 Man residues and [alpha]-amino substituted asparagine. The binding of Vip36 to high-mannose type glycans was independent of Ca2+ and theoptimal condition was pH 6.0 at 37\xb0C. The concentration at which half inhibition of the binding by Man7-9\xb7GlcNAc2\xb7NAc\xb7Asn occurred was 1.0 \xd7 10-9 M. The association constant between Man7-9\xb7GlcNAc2 in porcine thyroglobulin and immobilized Vip36 was 2.1 \xd7 108 M-1 as determined by means of a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance. These results indicate that VIP36 functions as an intracellular lectin recognizing glycoproteins which possess high-mannose type glycans, (Man[alpha]1->2)2-4\xb7Man5\xb7GlcNAc2.'",2
"b'The location of human area V5 (or MT) has been correlated with the intersection of the ascending limb of the inferior temporal sulcus (ALITS) and the lateral occipital sulcus (LO). This study was undertaken to attempt a replication and quantification of these observations using functional magnetic resonance imaging. V5 was significantly activated in 19 hemispheres with alternating, low contrast, random checkerboard patterns. We confirmed the stereotaxic location of V5 and were able to describe a fairly consistent sulcal pattern in the parieto-temporo-occipital cortex. V5 was usually (95%) buried within a sulcus, most commonly within the inferior temporal sulcus (ITS) (11%), the ascending limb of the ITS (ALITS) (53%) and the posterior continuation of the ITS (26%). The average distance from V5 of two identified anatomical landmarks of V5, the junctions of the LO and the ALITS, and the ITS and ALITS, were both ~1 cm. However, the LO\x96ALITS junction often had to be determined by interpolation (47%), and was not always present even with interpolation (21%). In contrast, the ITS\x96ALITS junction was always present and V5 was usually (90%) located in a sulcus intersecting with this junction, making it a more reliable landmark for localizing V5 with respect to gross morphological features on individual cortical surfaces.'",1
"b'In the human central nervous system, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor complex undergoes changes with both acute and chronic exposure to sedative\x96hypnotic drugs. These changes contribute to both the acute effects of these drugs as well as the chronic effects of sedative\x96hypnotic dependence, withdrawal, and drug craving. Clinically these chronic effects are difficult to treat in patients dependent on ethanol or benzodiazepines. Valproate may return the GABA type A receptor function to a state more closely resembling its normal function. By this mechanism, it is possible to reduce the symptoms of sedative\x96hypnotic withdrawal and relapse.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""We use mathematical models to analyze the role of a memory cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in viral infections. The model predicts that antigen-independent persistence of an elevated number of precursor CTL (CTLp) does not protect the host from clinical symptoms upon re-infection. Instead, we find that antigen-independent long-term persistence of CTLp is required to clear virus infections. This mechanism also applies to infection in hosts that have never experienced the pathogen before. Requirement of antigen for the long-term maintenance of CTLp results in failure to clear the infection, even in hosts characterized by a high CTL responsiveness. We compare the CTL model to a B cell model. In keeping with experimentally established findings, B cells are efficient in protecting against re-infection, but are unlikely to clear viral infections unless the virus is cytopathic. We conclude that the role of `memory CTLp' is different from the role of memory B cells in viral infections: antigen-independent long-term persistence of CTLp is a pre-requisite to ensure clearance of infection.""",4
"b'The binding affinity and specificity of the mushroom Polyporus squamosus lectin has been determined by the recently developed method of frontal affinity chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (FAC/MS). A micro-scale affinity column was prepared by immobilizing the lectin (~25 \xb5g) onto porous glass beads in a tubing column (9.8 \xb5l column volume). The column was then used to screen several oligosaccharide mixtures. The dissociation constants of 22 sialylated or sulfated oligosaccharides were evaluated against the immobilized lectin. The lectin was found to be highly specific for Neu5Ac{alpha}2\x966Gal\xdf1\x964Glc/GlcNAc containing oligosaccharides with Kd values near 10 \xb5M. The FAC/MS assay permits the rapid determination of the dissociation constants of ligands as well as a higher throughput screening of compound mixtures, making it a valuable tool for affinity studies, especially for testing large numbers of compounds.'",2
"b""Data on connections between the areas of the cerebral cortex and nuclei of the thalamus are too complicated to analyse with naked intuition. Indeed, the complexity of connection data is one of the major challenges facing neuroanatomy. Recently, systematic methods have been developed and applied to the analysis of the connectivity in the cerebral cortex. These approaches have shed light on the gross organization of the cortical network, have made it possible to test systematically theories of cortical organization, and have guided new electrophysiological studies. This paper extends the approach to investigate the organization of the entire corticothalamic network. An extensive collation of connection tracing studies revealed ~1500 extrinsic connections between the cortical areas and thalamic nuclei of the cat cerebral hemisphere. Around 850 connections linked 53 cortical areas with each other, and around 650 connections linked the cortical areas with 42 thalamic nuclei. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, optimal set analysis and non-parametric cluster analysis were used to study global connectivity and the `place' of individual structures within the overall scheme. Thalamic nuclei and cortical areas were in intimate connectional association. Connectivity defined four major thalamocortical systems. These included three broadly hierarchical sensory or sensory/motor systems (visual and auditory systems and a single system containing both somatosensory and motor structures). The highest stations of these sensory/motor systems were associated with a fourth processing system composed of prefrontal, cingulate, insular and parahippocampal cortex and associated thalamic nuclei (the `fronto-limbic system'). The association between fronto-limbic and somato-motor systems was particularly close.""",1
"b'We have isolated a novel gene, HS1BP3, which encodes an HS1 binding protein. Analysis of HS1BP3 cDNA indicates several potentially important segments, including a PX domain, a leucine zipper, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-like motifs and proline-rich regions. HS1BP3 associates with HS1 proteins in vivo as confirmed by immunoprecipitation in B and T cell lines. HS1BP3 preferentially associates with the HS1 SH3 domains rather than with other SH3 molecules, suggesting a role of HS1BP3 as an HS1 signaling mediator. Overexpression of mutant HS1BP3 protein in T cell lines results in decreased IL-2 production. Our data suggest a novel role for HS1BP3 in lymphocyte activation.'",4
"b'Background Increasing life expectancy has brought public health concern about the increase in prevalence of disability in old age. Reducing the prevalence of disability in older age requires the identification of preventable or modifiable risk factors earlier in life. We have examined the relationship between lifestyle and other potential risk factors in men aged 40\x9659 years at screening and locomotor disability 12\x9614 years later to assess whether any of these factors have direct and independent roles in influencing disability in later life.\r\n\r\nMethods In 1978\x961980, a longitudinal study of cardiovascular disease was initiated in 7735 men aged 40\x9659 years drawn from one general practice in each of 24 British towns. The present study concerns 5717 men, 88% of the surviving men who were available to follow-up (i.e. were registered with a GP and had an address) and who satisfactorily completed the disability section of a follow-up postal questionnaire in 1992 (Q92). The main endpoint from the questionnaire was locomotor disability based on self-reported inability in any one or more of the following: to get outdoors, walk 400 m, climb stairs, maintain balance, bend down, or straighten up.\r\n\r\nResults In the 5717 men (mean age 63 years) who provided information on disability status, 25.0% reported locomotor disability and the majority of these men recalled a doctor-diagnosed disease of which cardiovascular disease was most strongly associated with locomotor disability. Lifestyle factors at screening (smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and heavy drinking) and manual social class were strongly and independently associated with increased odds of locomotor disability 12\x9614 years later. By contrast, baseline blood pressure and serum total cholesterol showed little relationship with locomotor disability. Among men with diagnosed major cardiovascular disease (stroke, myocardial infarction, angina or aortic aneurysm) those with locomotor disability showed significantly higher adverse lifestyle factors at screening than those who were able. Similarly, adverse lifestyle factors were also seen more frequently among disabled men with respiratory disease and among disabled men with other non-cardiovascular conditions than among their able counterparts.\r\n\r\nConclusions Smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and heavy drinking in middle age are strong predictors of locomotor disability in later life independent of the presence of diagnosed disease. Leading a healthy lifestyle improves survival and reduces the incidence of disease. It also reduces the risk of locomotor disability and increases the odds of being disability-free even in the event of developing major cardiovascular disease.'",3
"b'A CHO mutant MI8-5 was found to synthesize Man9-GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol rather than Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol as the oligosaccharide-lipid intermediate in N-glycosylation of proteins. MI8-5 cells were incubated with labeled mevalonate, and the prenol was found to be dolichol. The mannose-labeled oligosaccharide released from oligosaccharide-lipid of MI8-5 cells was analyzed by HPLC and [alpha]-mannosidase treatment, and the data were consistent with a structure of Man9GlcNAc2. In addition, MI8-5 cells did not incorporate radioactivity into oligosaccharide-lipid during an incubation with tritiated galactose, again consistent with MI8-5 cells synthesizing an unglucosylated oligosaccharide-lipid. MI8-5 cells had parental levels of glucosylphosphoryldolichol synthase activity. However, in two different assays, MI8-5 cells lacked dolichol-P-Glc:Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol glucosyltransferase activity. MI8-5 cells were found to synthesize glucosylated oligosaccharide after they were transfected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG6, the gene for dolichol-P-Glc:Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol glucosyltransferase. MI8-5 cells were found to incorporate mannose into protein 2-fold slower than parental cells and to approximately a 2-fold lesser extent.'",2
"b'Lewis b (Leb) antigens are gradiently expressed from the proximal to the distal colon, i.e., they are abundantly expressed in the proximal colon, but only faintly in the distal colon. In the distal colon, they begin to increase at the adenoma stage of cancer development and then increase with cancer progression. We aimed to clarify the molecular basis of Leb antigen expression in correlation with the expression of other type I Lewis antigens, such as Lewis a (Lea) and sialylated Lewis a (sLea), in colon cancer cells. Considering the Se genotype and the relative activities of the H and Se enzymes, the amounts of Leb antigens were proved to be determined by both the H and Se enzymes in noncancerous and cancerous colon tissues. But the Se enzyme made a much greater contribution to determining the Leb amounts than the H enzyme. In noncancerous colons, the Se enzyme were gradiently expressed in good correlation with the Leb expression, while the H enzyme was constantly expressed throughout the whole colon. In distal colon cancers, the H and Se enzymes were both significantly upregulated in comparison with in adjacent noncancerous tissues. In proximal colon cancers, expression of the H enzyme alone was highly augmented. The augmented expression of Leb antigens in distal colon cancers is caused mainly by upregulation of the Se enzyme and partly by the H enzymes, while it is caused by upregulation of the H enzyme alone in proximal colon cancers. The Se gene dosage profoundly influences the amounts of the Leb, Lea, and sLea antigens in whole colon tissues, regardless of whether they are noncancerous or cancerous tissues. It suggests that the Se enzyme competes with [alpha]2,3 sialyltransferase(s) and the Le enzyme for the type I acceptor substrates.'",2
"b'Alcohol changes the progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease and may affect the outcome of interferon therapy.

The results show that 60\x9670% of subjects regularly consumed alcohol (median intake >40 g/day in about 30%). Less than 50% stopped drinking after being diagnosed as having liver disease.

The number of responders decreased as ethanol intake increased. There were less abstainers than drinkers among non-responders (10.7% vs 63.1% respectively; P < 0.001). Data indicate that alcohol will induce and worsen liver damage and, in subjects with chronic liver disease who continue to drink, adversely affect their response to treatment.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The surface layer glycoprotein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus DSM 10155 has a total carbohydrate content of 15% (by mass), consisting of O-linked oligosaccharide chains.

All glycopeptides possessed the novel linkage types [beta]-d-GalpNAc-(1->O)-Thr/Ser. The different cores were substituted with varying numbers of disaccharide repeating units. By 300 MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the complete carbohydrate core structure of the fluorescently labeled glyco-peptide B was determined after Smith-degradation of its glycan chain. The NMR data confirmed and complemented the results of the mass spectroscopy experiments. Based on the S-layer glycopeptide structure, a pathway for its biosynthesis is suggested.'",2
"b""General practitioners' (GPs') recognition of, attitudes towards, and intervention for, excessive drinking and alcohol problems among their patients were assessed in a postal questionnaire survey. Levels of recognition of, and intervention for, excessive drinking by GPs were low. GPs did not routinely enquire about alcohol and had managed only small numbers of patients specifically for excessive drinking or alcohol problems in the previous year. Enquiry about alcohol issues was elicited mainly by physical symptoms or by new patient registrations. Although 83% of GPs felt prepared to counsel excessive drinkers, only 21% felt effective in helping patients reduce consumption. Over the past 10 years, there appears to have been an increase in numbers of GPs who feel that they should be working with alcohol issues, but fewer GPs perceive themselves as being effective in this work. The main barriers to brief alcohol intervention were given as insufficient time and training, and lack of help from government policy; the main incentives related to availability of appropriate support services and proven efficacy of brief interventions""",0
"b'We examined per capita alcohol consumption and survey-based measures of alcohol use in Ontario in relation to indicators of alcohol problems for the period 1977\x961997. Per capita consumption and percentage of daily drinkers were significantly related to problem indicators, but percentage of drinkers and percentage of heavy drinkers were not. Of the measures we examined, per capita consumption was the strongest indicator of alcohol problems.'",0
"b'A 5-year, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) primary prevention study was conducted in Washington State to: (1) assess the feasibility of using a FAS diagnostic and prevention clinic as a centre for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women (namely women who had given birth to a child with FAS); (2) generate a comprehensive, lifetime profile of these women; (3) identify factors that have enhanced and/or hindered their ability to achieve abstinence. The results of this study are presented in two parts: work on objective 1 is summarized in the present paper; whereas that on objectives 2 and 3 is summarized in the accompanying paper. This project demonstrated that a multidisciplinary FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) clinic could successfully attract and meet the diagnostic and treatment planning needs of patients presenting with prenatal alcohol exposure. One out of every three patients evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics was diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed. The birth mothers of one out of every three of these children diagnosed with FAS or static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed could be located and directly contacted. Half of the birth mothers directly contacted were still at risk for producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, one out of every 18 children evaluated in the FAS DPN clinics had a birth mother who could be found and was at risk of producing more children damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Primary prevention programmes targeted to this high-risk population could lead to measurable, cost-effective reductions in the incidence of FAS. Using this approach, the cost of raising a child with FAS would be roughly 30 times the cost of preventing FAS in the child. The benefit to the children, their mothers, and society would be immeasurable.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Secondary prevention of alcohol problems in health care has been proved efficacious in many studies, yet its implementation remains scarce, and its effectiveness in regular health care remains unknown. This article reports results from a feasibility study of dissemination of alcohol prevention methods in primary health care in Stockholm. Initial interviews with general practitioners (GPs) and district health nurses indicated that few raised the issue of alcohol with patients, made notes about alcohol in patient charts or found working with alcohol issues rewarding. The impact of a training session, where a project nurse visited all willing GPs and nurses, was limited. Although the uptake of the prevention package was high, follow-up at 3 months indicated that little use was made of the materials. Specifically, screening rates were low. In the future, secondary prevention of alcohol problems will require better adaptation to the realities of primary care.'",0
"b'The dolichol-linked oligosaccharide donor (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol) for N-linked glycosylation of proteins is assembled in a series of reactions that initiate on the cytoplasmic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and terminate within the lumen. The biochemical analysis of the oligosaccharyltransferase and the glycosyltransferases that mediate assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (OS-PP-Dol) has been hindered by the lack of structurally homogeneous substrate preparations. We have developed an improved method for the preparative-scale isolation of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides from vertebrate tissues and yeast cells. Preparations that were highly enriched in either Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol or Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol were obtained from porcine pancreas and a Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol preparation was obtained from an {Delta}alg3 yeast culture. Chromatography of the OS-PP-Dol preparations on an aminopropyl silica column was used to obtain dolichol-linked oligosaccharides with defined structures. A single chromatography step could achieve near-baseline resolution of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides that differed by one sugar residue. A sensitive oligosaccharyltransferase endpoint assay was used to determine the concentration and composition of the OS-PP-Dol preparations. Typical yields of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, and Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol ranged between 5 and 15 nmol per chromatographic run. The homogeneity of these preparations ranged between 85 and 98% with respect to oligosaccharide composition. Purification of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides from cultures of alg mutant yeast strains provides a general method to obtain authentic OS-PP-Dol assembly intermediates of high purity. The analytical methods described here can be used to accurately evaluate the steady-state dolichol-linked oligosaccharide compositions of wild-type and mutant cell lines.'",2
"b""Background As part of a nested case-control study of benign proliferative breast disease (BPBD) conducted within the cohort of women participating in the Alberta breast screening programme, an analysis of all women who had a benign breast biopsy between 1990 and 1995 was undertaken to identify the epidemiological risk factors for BPBD.\r\n\r\nMethods The breast biopsies of all eligible women were re-reviewed by a panel of four pathologists using Page's classification for benign breast disease. Cases were 165 women whose biopsies, upon review, showed benign breast tissue changes ranging from sclerosing adenosis to atypical ductal hyperplasia. Controls were 217 women whose biopsies showed no evidence of any proliferative or neoplastic changes. In-person interviews were conducted with all study subjects.\r\n\r\nResults Women with >=25% fibroglandular breast tissue density, as compared to women with <25% density, experienced nearly a doubling in risk of BPBD (OR = 1.91, 95% CI : 1.24\x962.94). All other possible risk factors examined were not associated with BPBD.\r\n\r\nConclusion This study suggests that fibroglandular tissue density may be a risk factor, or marker, for increased risk of BPBD.""",3
"b'We have shown previously that administration of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells to naive Lewis rats induces not only autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but also a near total resistance to subsequent disease. By isolating the effector cells that are responsible for the resistance, we demonstrated that disease protection paralleled with increased numbers of a CD8+ regulatory T cell (RTC) subset and that co-injection of this RTC subset with encephalitogenic T cells aborted the pathogenic activity of the latter cells. Here, we show that a radio-sensitive splenic population of RTC also exists in naive rats that can be recruited and activated to inhibit the onset of secondary episodes of adoptive EAE. In co-transfer experiments, this protective RTC subpopulation can be isolated to neutralize the pathogenic activity of stimulatory MBP-reactive T cells in vivo. We show that the frequency of RTC with specificity for MBP-reactive T cells in naive rats is two orders of magnitude higher than the frequency of MBP-specific precursors, the activity of RTC increases substantially with age and RTC frequencies increase as a consequence of immunization with MBP-reactive cells lines. In specificity studies, we show that RTC isolated from naive rats and RTC from animals primed with one MBP-reactive cell line show cross-reactive responses to a variety of different MBP-reactive T cell lines. However, following repeated stimulation with a given MBP line, these RTC display a more limited, clonotypic response to the selecting line and assume a uniform CD8 phenotype. Finally, functional studies with RTC indicate that proliferative and lytic specificities do not necessarily correlate and that activated rat RTC are especially lytic for a Fas-sensitive murine cell line.'",4
"b'Background The actual yield from current screening for clinically significant congenital heart malformations in Dutch child health care is far from optimal. In this study factors that determine the effectiveness of this screening are identified and recommendations for the optimization of the screening programme are formulated.\r\n\r\nMethods Eighty-two patients with a clinically significant congenital heart malformation were consecutively included in this study. Parents and child health centre physicians were interviewed in order to establish the screening, detection and referral history. Paediatric cardiologists established whether these patients were diagnosed \x91in time\x92 or \x91too late\x92.\r\n\r\nResults Incomplete performance of the screening examination has more influence on the occurrence of delayed diagnoses than failure by parents to adhere to the complete visit schedule. Adequate screening advances detection of congenital heart malformations. Severity, however, is the most predominant determinant of the age at referral and diagnosis, as well as of the risk of complications. In only 7 out of 39 patients diagnosed \x91too late\x92, could no avoidable cause for an adverse outcome be found. In 10 cases (25%) there was a prolonged interval between first referral and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nConclusion To optimize the yield of the screening programme, improvement in the performance of the child health centre physicians and the co-operation of other physicians involved in reducing the interval between referral and diagnosis are required. Thus a considerable improvement in the prevention of complications of congenital heart malformations can be obtained.'",3
"b'The TCR is responsible for the specificity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) by recognizing peptides presented in the context of MHC. By producing recombinant soluble TCR, it is possible to study this interaction at the molecular level. We generated single-chain TCR (scTCR) from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and one CTL clone directed against melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-1. Sixty-eight day anti-MAGE-1 TIL and one cloned anti-MAGE-1 CTL were analyzed by PCR for their V{alpha} and V\xdf gene usage. The TIL population showed a restriction in V{alpha} and V\xdf usage with only V{alpha}4 and V{alpha}9 and V\xdf2 and V\xdf7 expressed. The anti-MAGE-1 CTL clone demonstrated absolute restriction with only V{alpha}12 and V\xdf1 expressed. DNA sequence analysis was performed on all V regions. For the TIL, each possible V{alpha}\x96V\xdf combination (i.e. V{alpha}4\x96V\xdf2, V{alpha}9\x96V\xdf2, V{alpha}4\x96V\xdf7 and V{alpha}9\x96V\xdf7) was constructed as a distinct scTCR and the recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. From the anti-MAGE-1 TIL, V{alpha}4\x96V\xdf2 scTCR demonstrated binding activity to HLA-A1+ cells pulsed with MAGE-1 peptide. Results obtained from screening a panel of our scTCR constructs on HLA-A1+ cells pulsed with MAGE-1 peptide or irrelevant peptide demonstrated that V\xdf2 plays a significant role in binding to the MAGE-1 peptide. Amino acid alignment analysis showed that each V\xdf sequence is distinctly different from the others. These findings demonstrate that soluble TCR in single-chain format have binding activity. Furthermore, the results indicate that in TCR, like antibodies, one chain may contribute a dominant portion of the binding activity.'",4
"b'Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays an important role in the colonization of the airways of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. It binds to the carbohydrate part of respiratory and salivary mucins and its binding to cystic fibrosis mucins is even higher, suggesting that qualitative or/and quantitative modifications of the carbohydrate chains may be involved in this process. In order to find out the best carbohydrate receptors for P.aeruginosa, a flow cytometry technique using a panel of polyacrylamide based glycoconjugates labeled with fluorescein was developed. The neoglycoconjugates contained neutral, sialylated or sulfated chains analogous to carbohydrate determinants found at the periphery of respiratory mucins (Lea, Ley, Lex, sialyl- and 3[prime]-sulfo-Lex, and blood group A determinants). We used also neoglycoconjugates containing Gal([alpha]1-2)Gal[beta] and sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine determinants. The interaction of these glycoconjugates with the nonpiliated strain of P.aeruginosa, 1244-NP, was saturable except for the glycoconjugates containing blood group A or sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine epitopes. The measure of Kd indicated that strain 1244-NP had a higher affinity for the glycoconjugate bearing the sialyl-Lex determinant than for all the other glycoconjugates studied. The role of sialic acid was confirmed by competition assay using mainly sialylated mucin glycopeptides. In order to find out if this behavior was the same for pathological strains as for the 1244-NP mutant, four mucoid strains of P.aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients were analyzed with the Lex neoglycoconjugate, its sialylated and its sulfated derivatives. Individual variations in the binding of these strains to the three glycoconjugates were observed. However, three strains out of four had a higher affinity for the sialyl-Lex than for the 3[prime]-sulfo-Lex derivative.'",2
"b'We have identified a novel N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity in lactating bovine mammary gland membranes. Acceptor specificity studies and analysis of products obtained in vitro by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the enzyme catalyses the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to acceptor substrates carrying a terminal, [beta]-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue and establishes a [beta]1->4-linkage forming a GalNAc[beta]1->4GlcNAc (N,N[prime]-diacetyllactosediamine, lacdiNAc) unit. Therefore, the enzyme can be identified as a UDP-GalNAc:GlcNAc[beta]-R [beta]1->4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase ([beta]4-GalNAcT). This enzyme resembles invertebrate [beta]4-GalNAcT as well as mammalian [beta]4-galactosyltransferase ([beta]4-GalT) in acceptor specificity. It can, however, be clearly distinguished from the pituitary hormone-specific [beta]4-GalNAcT by its incapability of acting with an elevated activity on a glycoprotein substrate carrying a hormone-specific peptide motif. Furthermore, the GalNAcT activity appeared not to be due to a promiscuous action of a [beta]4-GalT as could be demonstrated by comparing the [beta]4-GalNAcT and [beta]4-GalT activities of the mammary gland, bovine colostrum, and purified [beta]4-GalT, by competition studies with UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal, and by use of an anti-[beta]4-GalT polyclonal inhibiting antibody. Interestingly, under conditions where mammalian [beta]4-GalT forms with [alpha]-lactalbumin ([alpha]-LA) the lactose synthase complex, the mammary gland [beta]4-GalNAcT was similarly induced by [alpha]-LA to act on Glc with an increased efficiency yielding the lactose analog GalNAc[beta]1->4Glc. This enzyme thus forms the second example of a mammalian glycosyltransferase the specificity of which can be modified by this milk protein. It is proposed that the mammary gland [beta]4-GalNAcT functions in the synthesis of lacdiNAc-based, complex-type glycans frequently occurring on bovine milk glycoproteins. The action of this enzyme is to be considered when aiming at the production of properly glycosylated protein biopharmaceuticals in the milk of transgenic dairy animals.'",2
"b'Rat liver tryptophan (Trp) pyrrolase activity and gene expression were studied in relation to the alcohol-withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Both activity and gene expression were enhanced after withdrawal of ethanol-containing liquid diets and the time-course of these changes mirrored that of development and intensity of the behavioural disturbances of the AWS. By contrast, no correlation was observed between the AWS-induced behaviour and changes in activity of another hepatic glucocorticoid-inducible enzyme, tyrosine aminotransferase, and a negative correlation was noted between behaviour and the gene expression of this latter enzyme and also of that of the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor. We suggest that the metabolic consequences of activation of liver Trp pyrrolase during alcohol withdrawal may play a role in the behavioural features of the AWS.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Background The genetic basis of several familial cancers including breast and colon cancers has been identified recently. The occurrence of multiple cancers in one individual is also suggestive of a genetic predisposition. To evaluate inherited predisposition in pancreatic cancer we compared the clinical data of pancreatic cancer patients with and without multiple primaries as well as the frequency of malignancies among their relatives.\r\n\r\nMethods Detailed data on 69 pancreatic cancer patients included survival time and TNM-classification. Index case data were separated into two groups. The first group (group 1) developed only pancreatic cancer during their lifetime, whereas the second group (group 2) developed additional primary tumours. A systematic family history was taken from 59 of these pancreatic cancer patients using a standardized questionnaire. The pancreatic cancers and the multiple primaries of the 59 patients were histologically proven.\r\n\r\nResults Of the 69 pancreatic cancer patients, 13 (18.8%) had multiple primaries. Neither the clinical data nor the survival data of the index cases revealed differences between the two groups (all nominal P-values >0.05). In the family history study blood relatives developed a malignancy in 51% (24 of 47) of the families in group 1 compared to 75% (9 of 12) in group 2. The risk of relatives in group 2 of developing a malignant tumour was significantly higher (P = 0.034) than in group 1 after adjustments for family size and age of disease onset of the index case. The cancer spectrum of the 59 families mainly included tumours of the digestive tract and the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nConclusions A multiple primary cancer history is a common condition among pancreatic cancer patients. Relatives of these patients seem to have an increased risk for the development of distinct malignant solid tumours, which might be caused by an inherited predisposition. Clinical and genetic investigation of pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries and their families might lead to the identification of predisposing gene defects providing a new goal for the understanding of a shared genetic basis of different solid tumours.'",3
"b'The cerebral cortex develops from the dorsal telencephalon, at the anterior end of the neural tube. Neurons are generated by cell division at the inner surface of the telencephalic wall (in the ventricular zone) and migrate towards its outer surface, where they complete their differentiation. Recent studies have suggested that the transcription factor Pax6 is important for regulation of cell proliferation, migration and differentiation at various sites in the CNS. This gene is widely expressed from neural plate stage in the developing CNS, including the embryonic cerebral cortex, where it is required for radial glial cell development and neuronal migration. We report new findings indicating that, in the absence of Pax6, proliferative rates in the early embryonic cortex are increased and the differentiation of many cortical cells is defective. A major question concerns the degree to which cortical defects in the absence of Pax6 are a direct consequence of losing the gene function from defective cells themselves, rather than being secondary to abnormalities in other cells. Cortical defects in the absence of Pax6 become much more pronounced later in cortical development, and we propose that many result from a compounding of abnormalities in proliferation and differentiation that first appear at the onset of corticogenesis.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Inflammatory granulomatous reactions in liver elicited by schistosomal infection have been shown to function as active extramedullar myelopoietic sites, producing potentially all the myeloid lineages. We have now addressed the question of the extramedullar B lymphopoiesis in these sites. We have shown the presence of early B cell precursors (pro-B cells) in the granulomas by immunophenotyping. Their total number in the liver was equivalent to the pro-B cells in the bone marrow of one femur. In agreement with their phenotype, the RT-PCR analysis showed that these cells expressed RAG-1 and {lambda}5 genes. However, the conversion of the pro-B to pre-B cells was not observed and no clonogenic B cell precursors could be detected in semi-solid cultures stimulated by IL-7. The granulomatous stroma was shown to produce IL-7 and express c-kit, and was able to sustain the full B lymphopoiesis in vitro. Conversely, the granuloma supernatant was shown to inhibit actively the development of B lymphocytes. We conclude that the granuloma environment elicits homing and proliferation of totipotent hematopoietic precursors, and that it is permissive for early commitment to the B cell lineage, but the full extramedullar production of B cell is abrogated by soluble factors produced inside the granulomas.'",4
"b""We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of STAT5 activation through the human IL-4 receptor (IL-4R). By functionally expressing receptor mutants in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3, we could show that phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the IL-4R {alpha} chain are dispensable for IL-4-induced STAT5 activity. However, disruption of a membrane-proximal proline-rich sequence motif (`box1') in either subunit of the bipartite IL-4R abolished not only ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3, but also IL-4-triggered activation of STAT5 and concomitant cell proliferation. A dominant-negative version of STAT5b, but not of STAT5a, interfered with IL-4-induced DNA synthesis in Ba/F3 cells, suggesting an involvement of STAT5b in the control of cell proliferation through IL-4R. Reporter gene experiments finally showed that transcription from promoters of STAT5 target genes can be specifically induced by challenging cells with IL-4, and that both STAT5a and STAT5b can contribute to IL-4-triggered transcriptional control.""",4
"b'A pre-TCR\x96CD3 signal is required for the efficient maturation of CD4\x96CD8\x96 thymocytes to the CD4+CD8+ stage. This study addressed whether a similar signal is required for maturation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) that may develop extrathymically. We have shown previously that IEL from mice deficient for CD3-associated {zeta} chains include an immature population of CD3\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+ cells expressing cytoplasmic TCR \xdf chains but lacking detectable surface TCR{alpha}\xdf, CD16 and B220. Here we stimulated the appearance of such IEL in {epsilon}+/\x96{zeta}\x96/\x96 mice by expression of an activated Lck transgene or in vivo treatment with anti-CD3{epsilon}. Anti-CD3{epsilon} treatment of RAG-deficient animals also yielded CD16\x96B220\x96 IEL. In contrast, expression of a TCR\xdf transgene in rag-1\x96/\x96 mice did not stimulate the appearance of CD3\x96CD8{alpha}{alpha}+CD16\x96B220\x96 cells. Taken together these data indicate that although anti-CD3{epsilon} treatment and LckF505 assist in catalyzing a CD16+B220+ -> CD16\x96B220\x96 transition, these manipulations are not equivalent to a pre-TCR signal in IEL lymphocytes.'",4
"b'We analyzed the distribution of the receptor-anchoring protein gephyrin in the normal and deafferented rat dentate gyrus to investigate whether the expression of this postsynaptic protein is altered in response to the formation of new synaptic contacts. Confocal microscopy and digital image analysis revealed that in normal dentate gyrus immunolabeling was most prominent in the outer molecular layer and decreased successively in the direction of the granule cell layer. Simultaneous immunolabeling for gephyrin and cell-specific markers showed that granule cells and parvalbumin-positive interneurons express gephyrin. Large, intensely stained, gephyrin-positive clusters were distributed along distinct dendrites, and most of them were positive for parvalbumin. Calbindin-immunostained dendrites were associated with smaller, gephyrin-positive clusters. Lesion of the medial entorhinal cortex leads to deafferentiation of the middle molecular layer which resulted in an increased gephyrin immunoreactivity. These changes were due to a significantly increased concentration of the very small gephyrin-positive clusters. Parvalbumin-positive dendrites did not display any increase in co-localizing gephyrin-positive structures. The altered immunolabeling pattern persisted until 12 weeks after lesion, a time when the process of synaptic reorganization is complete. Our findings suggest that synaptogenesis following deafferentiation results in a cell-specific redistribution of gephyrin immunoreactivity at specific inhibitory synapses.'",1
"b'Co-stimulation of murine EL-4 thymoma cells\x97carrying high numbers of TCR and type I IL-1 receptors (IL-1R)\x97with anti-CD3 antibodies and IL-1 resulted in synergistic enhancement of IL-2 synthesis. While the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade was activated by both receptors, IL-1 preferentially stimulated Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase or microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK). Interruption of TCR- or IL-1R-stimulated ERK cascade by PD-98059, a specific inhibitor of MAP/ERK kinase (MEK), resulted in partial suppression of nuclear factor of activated T cells activation and in complete inhibition of IL-1-stimulated NF{kappa}B activation. Suppression of activation of both MEK and p38 MAPK resulted in significant inhibition of IL-2 gene expression. The results show that maximal activation of the IL-2 gene requires activation of at least two different protein kinase cascades, i.e. of the ERK and p38 pathways but presumably also that of JNK which converge at the level of the IL-2 promoter resulting in enhancement of its transcriptional activity.'",4
"b""The cerebral cortex is the highest achievement of biological evolution and the neural substrate of human mental abilities. Molecular biological techniques have opened the possibility of investigating how specific regulatory genes and morphoregulatory molecules mediate formation of this complex structure. During evolution, the cerebral cortex has undergone disproportionate growth relative to the rest of the brain [reviewed by Northcutt and Kaas (Northcutt and Kaas, 1995Go)]. This increase predominately affected its surface area, rather than its thickness, and was accompanied by the addition and elaboration of functional subdivisions. Furthermore, the [deletion] region that has increased in size the most, the neocortex, acquired a characteristic laminar structure that is not readily apparent in the cortex of non-mammalian vertebrates. These changes in the size, complexity and histological organization of the cerebral cortex presumably reflect the elaboration of the cortical circuitry which ultimately endowed the human brain with its extraordinary capacity for reasoning and language.\r\n\r\nThe cortex, or pallium, is comprised of several subdivisions. In mammals, these functionally distinct regions include the hippocampus, parahippocampal areas, neocortex, entorhinal cortex, olfactory cortex, claustrum and olfactory bulb. Each has characteristic histological features, wiring diagrams and functionally distinct subdomains. Based on cytoarchitectonic criteria, the human cerebral cortex was subdivided into more than 50 areas (Brodmann, 1909Go). More recent methods are revealing even greater complexity in the categories, number and functional significance of cortical parcellation (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Go). The remarkable conservation of the pattern of areal divisions within a given species suggests the existence of a highly conserved and rigidly regulated regional specification program that controls their development (Rakic, 1988Go). The evidence presented in this issue of Cerebral Cortex is in accord with the view that neocortical regional specification depends on interactions between intrinsic properties of cortical cells with input from subcortical structures.\r\n\r\nCortical development has been scrutinized by developmental neurobiologists during this century. Their studies provide an essential physiological, anatomical and cellular foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate its assembly. The discovery of genes that regulate brain development is now revolutionizing our ability to understand the intricacies of neuroembryology, and to identify how neuropathological processes derail cortical development.\r\n\r\nGenetic studies of invertebrate development in flies and nematodes have had a fundamental role in expediting the progress. The identification of genes that regulate regional specification (e.g. gap and homeotic genes), segmentation (e.g. segment polarity genes), neurogenesis (e.g. neurogenic and proneural genes) and programmed cell death (apoptotic genes) provided key insights into regulatory genes that could control early development of the vertebrate brain. In the mid-1980s, the first mammalian homologs of genes that control early development in Drosophila were identified; these included the Hox genes. The expression of these genes have distinctive anteroposterior boundaries in the vertebrate spinal cord and hindbrain. Their expression patterns provided new evidence for a neuromeric, or segmental organization of the hindbrain [reviewed by McGinnis and Krumlauf (McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992Go)]. Vertebrate homologs of Drosophila segment polarity genes, such as engrailed and wingless, have been found to be expressed in the midbrain and hindbrain [reviewed by Joyner (Joyner, 1996Go)]. By the late 1980s, the first candidates for genetic regulators of forebrain development began to be reported. These are the Brn genes, which were identified by their homology to the POU family of transcription factors that regulate mammalian pituitary development, and other developmental processes in flies and worms [reviewed by Wegner et al. (Wegner et al., 1993Go)]. The Brn genes are expressed in the forebrain and in other regions of the central nervous system (CNS). In 1990, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila neurogenic basic helix\x96loop\x96 helix transcription factor achaete-scute (Mash1) was reported; like the Brn genes, Mash1 is expressed in the forebrain, as well as in more posterior regions of the CNS (Lo et al., 1991Go). Then, in 1991, the first forebrain-specific regulatory genes were reported: Dlx1, Dlx2 and Nkx2.1 (TTF1; T/ebp) [reviewed by Rubenstein and Puelles (Rubenstein and Puelles, 1994Go)]. These homeobox genes were identified either through a directed search for forebrain regulatory genes, or by their homology to other homeobox genes, or by serendipity. Within a year, the Otx and Emx genes, homologs of the orthodenticle and empty spiracle genes that control Drosophila head development, were found to be expressed in nested patterns in the mouse forebrain and midbrain [reviewed by Boncinelli et al. (Boncinelli et al., 1993Go)].\r\n\r\nBy 1993, vertebrate homologs of Drosophila genes encoding secreted morphogens and patterning molecules, such as hedgehog and decapentaplegic, were demonstrated to be expressed in longitudinal stripes along the ventral and dorsal aspects of the entire neuraxis [reviewed by Tanabe and Jessell (Tanabe and Jessell, 1996Go) and Shimamura and Rubenstein (Shimamura and Rubenstein, 1997Go)]. Finally, several genes that regulate the number and survival of cells in the nematode, through regulating apoptosis (Metzstein et al., 1998Go), were found to play a similar role in the mammalian forebrain (e.g. caspase-3 and -9) (Kuida et al., 1996Go, 1998Go). The regional distribution of apoptotic cells in the mouse CNS appears to be regulated by the combination of Jnk1 and Jnk2 kinases (Kuan et al., 1999Go), genes that were also identified in Drosophila [reviewed by Haydar et al. (Haydar et al., 1999Go)].\r\n\r\nThe expression patterns of these regulatory genes frequently exhibit discrete anteroposterior (transverse) and dorsoventral (longitudinal) boundaries, which suggested a Cartesian-like organization for parts of the forebrain. These findings led to the Prosomeric Model, which suggests that the diencephalon, and perhaps more rostral forebrain regions, have a segment-like organization similar to that of the hindbrain (Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993Go; Rubenstein et al., 1994Go). In parallel with the discoveries of genes that control brain patterning and differentiation, genes were identified which encoded secreted and cell-surface proteins that regulate cell\x96cell interactions, axon path-finding and cell migration. The advent of targeted mutagenesis in mouse has made it possible to discover the functions of these genes, and in most cases has confirmed their essential roles in controlling brain development.\r\n\r\nThe papers in this Special Issue of the Cerebral Cortex focus on genes that are implicated in controlling regionalization, morphogenesis and differentiation of the cerebral cortex, processes which undoubtedly control cortical size, cell-type specification and connectivity. The papers review recent advances in molecular genetics that have illuminated mechanisms of cortical development beginning from its earliest stages through early postnatal life. The chapters by Acampora et al. (Acampora et al., 1999Go), Arimatsu et al. (Arimatsu et al., 1999Go), Dou et al. (Dou et al., 1999Go), Eagleson and Levitt (Eagleson and Levitt, 1999Go), Rubenstein et al. (Rubenstein et al., 1999Go), and Grove and Tole (Grove and Tole, 1999Go) review possible mechanisms for induction and regionalization of the cortex. Rubenstein et al. describe patterning centers in the neural plate and prosencephalon which produce potential morphogens, and some of the transcription factors that interpret these patterning signals (Rubenstein et al., 1999Go). Acampora et al. focus on the early roles of the Otx homeobox transcription factors in patterning the midbrain and forebrain, and their later roles in cortex differentiation (Acampora et al., 1999Go). Dou et al. describe the role of BF1, which encodes a winged-helix transcription factor that is required for telencephalic patterning and proliferation (Dou et al. 1999Go). Arimatsu et al. and Eagleson and Levitt review studies that have used the latexin, lamp and other genes to study the process of regional specification of the lateral cortex (Arimatsu et al., 1999Go; Eagleson and Levitt, 1999Go). Grove and Tole consider mechanisms that control patterning of the medial cortex, the region that gives rise to the hippocampus (Grove and Tole, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nSeveral of the papers describe genes whose expression defines regional boundaries in the developing cerebral cortex. These genes are useful markers in experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanisms that generate cortical subdivisions. For instance, in the paper by Rubenstein et al. evidence is presented that expression of the Id2 gene respects the boundary of the sensory and motor neocortex (Rubenstein et al., 1999Go). Papers by Hatanaka and Jones, and Grove and Tole describe several genes that are regionally expressed in medial aspects of the cortex, particularly in the region of the hippocampus (Hatanaka and Jones, 1999Go; Grove and Tole, 1999Go). Papers by Donoghue and Rakic, Mackarehtschian et al. and Rubenstein et al. describe the regional expression of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands (ephrins) in the cerebral cortex (Donoghue and Rakic, 1999Go; Mackarehtschian et al., 1999Go; Rubenstein et al., 1999Go). These genes, some of which are expressed in gradients, and others in discrete domains, are likely candidates for regulating topographic maps and distribution of inputs to the cortex as has been suggested in subcortical structures (O'Leary and Wilinson, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nThe papers by Gitton et al. and Rubenstein et al. discuss the roles of thalamic afferents in regulating regionalization of the neocortex, and review the evidence that a considerable degree of regionalization of the cerebral cortex occurs before the arrival of thalamic afferents, as predicted by the existence of an intrinsic protomap within the cerebral vesicle (Gitton et al., 1999aGo; Rubenstein et al., 1999Go) [see also Rakic (Rakic, 1988Go)]. Gitton et al.'s study suggests that some neocortical regions are specified at very early stages of telencephalon development although this prepattern is revealed only once thalamic afferents grow into the neocortex (Gitton et al., 1999aGo) [see also Gitton et al. (Gitton et al. 1999bGo)]. Finally, Rubenstein et al. (Rubenstein et al., 1999Go) refer to recent experiments demonstrating a remarkable degree of neocortical regionalization in the absence of thalamic inputs (Miyashita-Lin et al., 1999Go).\r\n\r\nEvolution of the cortex has been postulated to occur in part through changes in the proliferation of neuronal precursors in the ventricular zone and allocation of postmitotic cells to their proper laminar and areal positions in the cortical plate (Caviness, 1995; Rakic, 1995Go). Papers by Dou et al. and Warren et al. discuss the roles of the BF1 and Pax6 genes, respectively, in regulating proliferation in the developing cortex (Dou et al., 1999Go; Warren et al., 1999Go). The number of cortical neuronal and glial cells also depends also on programmed cell death (PCD or apoptosis) that occur in the germinal layers prior to onset of neurogenesis. Targeted disruption of cell death-effector genes such as caspase-3 and caspase-9 and Jnk1/2 revealed that cells must die on schedule and in the proper position in the proliferative zones. Knockout mice lacking both copies of these genes have an increased number of founder cells in the ventricular zone that eventually generate supernumerary cortical neurons resulting in an expanded cerebral surface that shows sign of convolutions (Haydar et al., 1999Go).\r\n\r\nThe control of cell-type identity within the cortex is the subject of the paper by Anderson et al. (Anderson et al., 1999Go). Of the two major classes of neurons in the cortex \x97 projection neurons, which are glutaminergic, and interneurons, which are mainly GABAergic \x97 several studies now indicate that many of the latter are produced in the basal ganglia, rather than derived from the proliferative zone of the neocortex. While GABAergic neurons originating from the basal ganglia migrate tangentially into the cerebral cortex, most projection neurons originating in the ventricular zone migrate radially (Ware et al., 1999Go). GABAergic neurons appear to originate from at least two distinct sources and migrate along at least two distinct pathways. Furthermore, the genetic control of interneuron and projection neuron development appears to be distinct, as the Dlx genes regulate the former and genes such as Pax6, Otx1 and Tbr1 regulate the latter. New evidence is presented which suggests that Dlx genes can in fact induce the GABAergic phenotype (Anderson et al., 1999Go). Thus radial and tangential cell migration seem to be used by distinct cell types in cortical development. The modes of migration and genes that regulate their allocation to the cortex are discussed by Ware et al. (Ware et al., 1999Go). Advances in this area are beginning to provide insights into the etiologies of neuronal migration disorders in humans (Walsh, 1999Go).\r\n\r\nFinally, inroads into the mechanisms controlling axon pathfinding are illuminating how cortical connections are formed. Discussion of some aspects of this subject is presented in the chapters by Arimatsu et al., Hatanaka and Jones, and Rubenstein et al. (Arimatsu et al., 1999Go; Hatanaka and Jones, 1999Go; Rubenstein et al., 1999Go). A number of mouse mutants are yielding new insights into the molecules and mechanisms that connect cortical cells to cortical and subcortical targets. Thus, in spite of the differences in functional requirements, cortical representation of the somatosensory and visual systems can be established independently of cues by synaptic activity, as has been found in the olfactory system (Bulfone et al., 1998Go; O'Leary et al. 1999Go).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, rapid progress is being made in the identification of the genes controlling cortical development. The stage is now set to describe in detail the genetic programs that regulate the processes that control regional specification, morphogenesis, cell type specification, neuronal migration and connectivity. Inroads have been made in identifying genes that control the size of the cerebral cortex through regulation of proliferation and cell death. Regionalization of the cortex appears to be controlled by patterning centers that control the activation of transcription factors that determine areal fate and the expression of cell surface molecules that control the topographic organization of synaptic inputs and outputs. Specific cell types appear to be generated in distinct locations within the telencephalon. Tangential migration introduces interneurons that are generated in the basal ganglia but destined to migrate to the cerebral cortex. On the other hand, radial migration pathways are used to generate the characteristic laminar structure of the mammalian cerebral cortex and are probably essential for maintaining the positional information of projection neurons that is required for correct connectivity. Finally, while inputs from the thalamus appear to have little influence on early regionalization of the cortex, they are necessary for controlling its maturation.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that understanding these fundamental processes will shed light on the similarities and differences of cortical structure in distinct vertebrate species and the mechanisms that have constrained evolutionary change. We also expect that this information will help in the search for methods to diagnose and treat human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Finally, we hope that this Special Issue of Cerebral Cortex will provide a useful resource to scientists interested in this subject, and that it will stimulate new ideas and experimental approaches.""",1
"b'Glycoproteins, which react with Lens culinaris agglutinin, in the membrane preparation of various portions of brains and spinal cords, obtained from 9-week-old rats and 29-month-old rats, were comparatively analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast to the samples from brain, which showed similar staining patterns in the two different age groups, the glycoprotein patterns of spinal cords showed marked differences by the age of donors. The most prominent evidence is that a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa (gp30) was detected in the aged rats, but not in the young adult rats. Based on the amino acid sequence data around the glycosylation site, the gp30 was identified as P0, which is a member of immunoglobulin superfamily and a major structural component of mammalian peripheral nerve myelin. This is the first report indicating that P0, which has been considered as a peripheral nerve-specific glycoprotein, occurs also in the spinal cord of mammals. In addition, nonglycosylated P0 molecule could be detected in the spinal cord of young adult rats by anti-P0 polyclonal antibody. These results indicate that the glycosylation state of the P0 molecule in the spinal cord changes during aging.'",2
"b'A previously developed method for the structural fingerprinting of keratan sulfates (Brown et al., Glycobiology, 5, 311-317, 1995) has been adapted for use with oligosaccharides fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzoic acid following keratanase II digestion. The oligosaccharides are separated by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography on a Dionex AS4A-SC column. This methodology permits quantitative analysis of labeled oligosaccharides which can be detected at the sub-nanogram (~100 fmol) level. Satisfactory calibration of this method can be achieved using commercial keratan sulfate standards. Keratan sulfates from porcine brain phosphocan and human ovarian tumors have been examined using this methodology, and their structural features are discussed.'",2
"b'Locally produced type I interferon (IFN-I) enhances the sensitivity of bone marrow B cell to IgM receptor ligation. The establishment of B cell repertoires, on the other hand, seems to involve selective processes that are critically dependent on B cell receptor (BCR) ligation. In order to assess the importance of BCR triggering thresholds on the selection of polyclonal unmanipulated B cell populations, we compared VH gene expression and reactivity repertoires in various B cell compartments of wild-type and IFN-I receptor-deficient mice (IFN-I-R\x96/\x96). These analyses demonstrate that increased B cell sensitivity to BCR ligation mediated by IFN-I in the bone marrow (BM) has consequences on the stringency of B cell repertoire selection. Thus, the normal counter-selection of both VH7183 gene family expression and multireactivity was impaired among immature BM B cells from mutant mice. Furthermore, as a result of reduced efficiency of BCR ligation-dependent inhibition of terminal differentiation, IFN-I-R\x96/\x96 animals produce, in BM and thymus, higher numbers of plasma cells secreting antibodies that are more multireactive than wild-type animals. Finally, mutant serum IgM natural antibodies display a more reactive repertoire than controls, a likely reflection of the BM resident plasma cell repertoire. The present observations demonstrate, therefore, that local modulation of BCR triggering thresholds leads to important modifications in the generation and/or selection of normal B cell populations.'",4
"b""Background The objective of this study was to assess the effect of mammographic parenchymal patterns on risk of breast cancer detected at first screen or in the period following a negative screen.\r\n\r\nMethods The study utilizes a nested case-control design with 132 breast cancer patients detected at first screen (from a total of 29 193 screened) and 42 breast cancer patients detected in the period following the first screen. These patients were matched to 348 screened-negative controls. The mammograms were classified according to Tabar's classification for parenchymal pattern and statistical analysis was done by conditional logistic regression.\r\n\r\nResults The risk of breast cancer for women with Tabar pattern IV was significantly high when compared to the remaining patterns (odds ratio 2.59). Risk factors for Tabar pattern IV coincided largely with established risk factors for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nConclusion The study confirms the increased risk of breast cancer associated with Tabar pattern IV (approximately Wolfe pattern P2), in an Asian population. This pattern is associated with nulliparity and high educational status and is strongly associated with grade 3 cancers.""",3
"b'Ethanol alone had no effect on neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in PC12 cells. However, in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), nNOS expression was amplified (threefold, P < 0.05), compared to NGF alone. This increase was eliminated with pretreatment of PC12 cells with staurosporine, suggesting that the effects of ethanol on nNOS expression are mediated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Do spatial operations on mental images and those on visually presented material share the same neural substrate? We used the high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether areas in the parietal lobe that have been implicated in the spatial transformation of visual percepts are also activated during the generation and spatial analysis of imagined objects. Using a behaviourally controlled mental imagery paradigm, which did not involve any visual stimulation, we found robust activation in posterior parietal cortex in both hemispheres. We could thus identify the subset of spatial analysis-related activity that is involved in spatial operations on mental images in the absence of external visual input. This result clarifies the nature of top-down processes in the dorsal stream of the human cerebral cortex and provides evidence for a specific convergence of the pathways of imagery and visual perception within the parietal lobes.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The orbitofrontal cortex has been cytoarchitectonically and connectionally subdivided into a medial and a lateral part which are assumed to subserve distinct functions in emotional processing. However the exact spatiotemporal mechanisms of negative and positive emotional processing in medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex remain unclear. We therefore investigated spatiotemporal orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortical activation patterns during emotional stimulation in a combined fMRI/MEG study. We investigated 10 healthy subjects, 5 women and 5 men. Positive and negative pictures from the International Affective Picture system (IAPS) were used for emotional stimulation, whereas neutral and gray pictures were taken as control conditions. fMRI/MEG measurements covered the whole frontal lobe and a time window between \x962000 and +200 ms around motor responses (right index finger extension) associated with each picture. Positively and negatively correlated activities were determined in various prefrontal/frontal cortical regions in fMRI. Isocontour maps and single dipoles in MEG were analyzed in 50 ms time windows ranging from \x962000 to +200 ms. Dipoles and fMR images were mapped on three-dimensional anatomical MRI so that anatomical localization of single dipoles and regional fMRI activity could be compared. Both negative and positive emotional conditions differed from non-emotional control conditions by strong orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal activation as well as by the presence of early magnetic fields (\x961700 to +1100 ms). Negative emotional processing was characterized by strong medial orbitofrontal activation and earlier (\x961700 ms), stronger and more medially oriented orbitofrontal dipoles. In contrast positive emotional processing showed a rather strong activation in lateral prefrontal cortex with later (\x961500 ms), weaker and more laterally oriented orbito and prefrontal dipoles. Negative emotional processing can be characterized by strong and early medial orbitofrontal cortical activation, whereas positive emotional processing showed rather later and weaker activation in lateral orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex. Such a functional dissociation between medial and lateral orbito-frontal/prefrontal cortex during negative and positive emotional processing lends further support to the assumption of a functional subdivision in the orbitofrontal cortex.'",1
"b'Although impaired liver regeneration is thought to be a major cause of death in patients with fulminant hepatitis, the mechanisms are not well defined. Since IL-12 synthesis has been reported to be up-regulated in murine hepatitis virus infection, we studied the influence of continuous IL-12 stimulation on murine liver regeneration using flow cytometric and functional analyses. In non-hepatectomized mice, interestingly, the number of hepatic NK cells was significantly decreased on day 7, after six IL-12 injections, and day 14, after 13 IL-12 injections. The number of hepatic NKT cells was markedly increased on day 7 and day 14 of daily IL-12 treatment. The cytotoxic activity of hepatic lymphocytes against both YAC-1 and p815 cells was enhanced on day 2, after single IL-12 injection, and day 7, after six IL-12 injections. In contrast, hepatic lymphocytes isolated 24 h after partial hepatectomy with IL-12 pretreatment did not show any cytolytic activity against either YAC-1 cells or p815 cells. However, continuous IL-12 stimulation resulted in a significantly higher serum alanine aminotransferase (sALT) level 24 h after the partial hepatectomy as compared with sALT levels in mice subjected to either partial hepatectomy or IL-12 pretreatment alone. On the other hand, the expression of hepatic TNF-{alpha} mRNA was markedly enhanced by continuous IL-12 stimulation even 24 h after partial hepatectomy, as compared with that in non-treated mice and hepatectomy alone. Simultaneous administration of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} mAb completely inhibited IL-12-induced in vivo enhancement of liver damage after partial hepatectomy. In conclusion, IL-12 induces the specific cytolytic activity against regenerating hepatocytes in vivo mainly through the enhancement of TNF-{alpha} synthesis.'",4
"b'This study investigates the time course and regional differences in age-related volume loss in cerebellum and brainstem. Threedimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry was used to measure the volumes of 11 regions in the cerebellum and three regions in the brainstem in 48 healthy volunteers (age 19.8\x9673.1 years). Landmark-adjusted lattices were used to divide the cerebellum into three radial (lobules I\x96V = lingula/lobulus/culmen, lobules VI\x96VII = declive/folium/tuber, lobules VIII\x96X = pyramis/ uvula/nodulus) and three transverse subdivisions (vermis, medial, lateral hemisphere). The radial sectors extended laterally throughout the vermis and the medial hemisphere. The brainstem was divided into midbrain, metencephalon (pons and tegmentum pontis) and medulla. Total cerebellar volume marginally declined with age using a linear regression model. An exponential model better described the age dependency of total cerebellar volume. The curve predicted that the volume remained stable until age 50 years and declined thereafter. Volume loss in the cerebellar vermis was striking. Shrinkage in the medial hemisphere was markedly less and only the inferior sector showed a trendwise negative association with age. The lateral hemisphere was not affected by age. No age effects were found for total brainstem volume, metencephalon and medulla. Only the mid-brain showed a trend for age-related shrinkage. The mediolateral gradient of decreasing age effects is similar to the histological pattern of alcoholic cerebellar atrophy (although our subjects were non-alcoholics according to DSM-IIIR criteria and laboratory data) suggesting that a common factor is involved in both processes. In search for a cause of the regional vulnerability, vascular, functional, structural and molecular/genetic factors may be considered.'",1
"b'Treatment with HgCl2 induces a systemic autoimmune disease in certain mice and rats. The major characteristic of this disease in mice with H-2s genotype is the production of anti-nucleolar autoantibodies (ANolA). The exact mechanism(s) for the production and the functional role of mercury-induced ANolA are not known. We have studied the ability of mercury-induced ANolA to enter the living cells in vivo and in vitro. We found that in highly susceptible mice, treatment with mercury induced ANolA capable of localizing in the nucleoli of kidney and liver cells in vivo. No detectable nucleoli localization of ANolA were found in the cells of the heart, stomach, intestine and spleen. Consistent with the in vivo studies, mercury-induced ANolA were also able to enter and translocate in the nucleoli of certain cells in vitro. The highest degree of antibody penetration was found in A-498 cells (a human kidney cell line) followed by 3T3 cells (a mouse fibroblast cell line), whereas the cells of lymphoid origin exhibited a very low degree of antibody penetration. Penetrated ANolA could be recovered from the nucleoli of live 3T3 cells previously treated with ANolA. The in vitro nucleolar translocation by ANolA did not affect the DNA synthesis, but was found to be an active process dependent on time and temperature. Furthermore, pre-treatment of living cells with trypsin markedly inhibited both cell entry and nucleolar accumulation of ANolA. Thus, mercury-induced ANolA have a unique ability to transgress the membrane of certain living cells in vivo and in vitro, and to localize in the nucleoli.'",4
"b'Studies of patients with cerebral achromatopsia have suggested that ventral occipitotemporal cortex is important for color perception. We created a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) version of a clinical test commonly used to assess achromatopsia, the Farnsworth\x96Munsell 100-Hue test. The test required normal subjects to use color information in the visual stimulus to perform a color sequencing task. A modification of the test requiring ordering by luminance was used as a control task. Subjects were also imaged as they passively viewed colored stimuli. A limited number of areas responded more to chromatic than achromatic stimulation, including primary visual cortex. Most color-selective activity was concentrated in ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Several areas in ventral cortex were identified. The most posterior, located in posterior fusiform gyrus, corresponded to the area activated by passive viewing of colored stimuli. More anterior and medial color-selective areas were located in the collateral sulcus and fusiform gyrus. These more anterior areas were not identified in previous imaging studies which used passive viewing of colored stimuli, and were most active in our study when visual color information was behaviorally relevant, suggesting that attention influences activity in color-selective areas. The fMRI version of the Farnsworth\x96Munsell test may be useful in the study of achromatopsia.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'In order to investigate the pathogenic mechanism responsible for liver injury associated with chronic alcoholism, we studied the effects of different dietary vitamin E levels in chronically ethanol (EtOH)-fed rats on the activity and mRNA regulation of the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) enzyme. Evidence is accumulating that intermediates of oxygen reduction may in fact be associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease. Since low vitamin E liver content seems to potentiate EtOH-linked oxidative stress, we studied the effect of EtOH treatment in livers from rats fed a diet deficient or supplemented with vitamin E. Chronic EtOH feeding enhanced hepatic consumption of vitamin E in both groups of EtOH-treated animals, irrespectively of the vitamin E level of the basal diet and the effect was observed in both the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions. Both EtOH-fed groups exhibited increased MnSOD gene expression, while the enzyme activity was enhanced only in the vitamin E-deprived group of EtOH-treated animals. The significant increase in manganese liver content found only in this last group could explain the rise of enzyme activity. In fact, in the absence of a parallel increase of the prosthetic ion manganese, MnSOD mRNA induction was not accompanied by a higher enzymatic activity. These findings support the role of oxidative alteration in the EtOH-induced chronic hepatotoxicity in which MnSOD response might represent a primary defence mechanism against the damaging effect of oxygen radical species.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Human {alpha}3-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-Ts) are known to convert N-acetyllactosamine to Gal\xdf1-4(Fuc{alpha}1-3)GlcNAc (Lewis x antigen); some of them transfer fucose also to GalNAc\xdf1-4GlcNAc, generating GalNAc\xdf1-4(Fuc{alpha}1-3)GlcNAc determinants.

The product structures were identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments; rotating frame nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy data suggested that the fucose and the distal N-acetylglucosamine are stacked in the same way as the fucose and the distal galactose of the Lewis x determinant. The products closely resembled a nodulation factor of Mesorhizobium loti but were distinct from nodulation signals generated by NodZ-enzyme.'",2
"b'IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene-disrupted mice are defective in IL-12 and IL-18 gene expression at the transcriptional and post-translational level respectively. The mutant mouse mounts a type 2 T cell response upon bacterial infection because of the impaired induction of the IL-12 p40 gene and IFN-{gamma}-producing type 1 T cells are not induced. We showed here, however, that different pathogens activate a novel pathway for inducing IFN-{gamma}-producing type 1 T cells even in an IRF-1-deficient mouse. This pathway is independent of IL-12 and IL-18, and is mediated by a distinct function of macrophage lineage cells. Macrophages of the mutant mice fail to activate the IL-12-dependent pathway, but they function in the IL-12-independent pathway in Plasmodium-infected mice. This leads to the hypothesis that the IL-12-independent novel pathway for inducing IFN-{gamma}-producing T cells is distinct from the classical type 1/type 2 T cell subset differentiation pathway.'",4
"b'Background Smoking has not been confirmed as a risk factor for cancers of the liver and stomach. The authors examined prospectively the relationship between smoking and these cancers in an endemic region.\r\n\r\nMethods The data used were a cohort study on the relationship between lifestyle and health in the region having the highest liver cancer mortality in Japan. Of the cohort members, 4050 males aged >=40 years were included in the present analysis with a 9-year mean follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) for cancer of the liver, stomach, smoking-related sites and others, while adjusting for age, residence, and alcohol intake.\r\n\r\nResults By the end of the study period, 59 cases of liver cancer and 53 cases of stomach cancer were identified. Current smokers, compared to subjects who had never smoked, had a threefold risk of liver cancer (RR = 3.3; 95% CI : 1.2\x969.5) and a twofold risk of stomach cancer (RR = 2.2; 95% CI : 0.8\x965.7). Sub-cohort analysis showed that adjustment for history of chronic liver disease did not attenuate the risk of liver cancer. Light/medium smokers had almost the same risk of these cancers as heavy smokers, while they showed a relatively low risk of smoke-related cancers.\r\n\r\nConclusions The present results indicate that smoking is a risk factor of liver and stomach cancer in a population with a high background risk for these cancers. However, causal inferences should be made cautiously due to a lack of information on known risk factors.'",3
"b'We have analyzed the expression patterns of mRNAs of five cell cycle related proteins in the ventricular zone of the neocortical cerebral wall over the course of the neuronogenetic interval in the mouse. One set of mRNAs (cyclin E and p21) are initially expressed at high levels but expression then falls to a low asymptote. A second set (p27, cyclin B and cdk2) are initially expressed at low levels but ascend to peak levels only to decline again. These patterns divide the overall neuronogenetic interval into three phases. In phase 1 cyclin E and p21 levels of mRNA expression are high, while those of mRNAs of p27, cdk2 and cyclin B are low. In this phase the fraction of cells leaving the cycle after each mitosis, Q, is low and the duration of the G1 phase, TG1, is short. In phase 2 levels of expression of cyclin E and p21 fall to asymptote while levels of expression of mRNA of the other three proteins reach their peaks. Q increases to approach 0.5 and TG1 increases even more rapidly to approach its maximum length. In phase 3 levels of expression of cyclin E and p21 mRNAs remain low and those of the mRNAs of the other three proteins fall. TG1 becomes maximum and Q rapidly increases to 1.0. The character of these phases can be understood in part as consequences of the reciprocal regulatory influence of p27 and cyclin E and of the rate limiting functions of p27 at the restriction point and of cyclin E at the G1 to S transition.\r\n\r\n'",1

"b'We recently reported that bile salts play a role in the regulation of mucin secretion by cultured dog gallbladder epithelial cells. In this study we have examined whether bile salts also influence mucin secretion by the human epithelial colon cell line LS174T. Solutions of bile salts were applied to monolayers of LS174T cells. Mucin secretion was quantified by measuring the secretion of [3H]GlcNAc labeled glycoproteins. Both unconjugated bile salts as well as taurine conjugated bile salts stimulated mucin secretion by the colon cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Hydrophobic bile salts were more potent stimulators than hydrophilic bile salts. Free (unconjugated) bile salts were more stimulatory compared with their taurine conjugated counterparts. Stimulation of mucin secretion by LS174T cells was found to occur at much lower bile salt concentrations than in the experiments with the dog gallbladder epithelial cells. The protein kinase C activators PMA and PDB had no stimulatory effect on mucin secretion. We conclude that mucin secretion by the human colon epithelial cell line LS174T is regulated by bile salts. We suggest that regulation of mucin secretion by bile salts might be a common mechanism, by which different epithelia protect themselves against the detergent action of bile salts, to which they are exposed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\r\nGastrointestinal mucus, the viscous gel that covers most of the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, derives its ability to protect epithelial surfaces from its major gelforming glycoprotein components called mucins. Mucin secretion is a unique function of columnar epithelial cells, and is not present in other cell types such as squamous or transitional epithelia. Columnar epithelial cells, including specialized \x93goblet cells,\x94 respond to multiple stimuli and possess a variety of receptors coupled to an assortment of intracellular transduction pathways. Most of the information available today on mucin secretion by the intestine has come from studies using immortalized mucin-secreting cell lines derived from colonic adenocarcinomas. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ has been reported to trigger mucin secretion. This has been demonstrated by stimulation with Ca2+ ionophores in the colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines T84 (Marcon et al., 1990; McCool et al., 1990) and the HT29-18N2 clone (Lencer et al., 1990). Also protein kinase C (PKC) appears to function in mucin secretion. Diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phorbol ester PMA stimulate mucin secretion by T84 (McCool et al., 1990) and HT29-18N2 cells (Philips, 1992). When T84 cells are stimulated by maximally effective concentrations of Ca2+ ionophore, increased mucin secretion occurs when PMA is added, which suggests that Ca2+ and PKC activate complementary but separate portions of the exocytotic response (McCool et al., 1990).\r\n\r\nRecently, cultured dog gallbladder epithelial cells were used to study the cellular response in mucin secretion to a number of putative secretagogues, as well as to determine the effective signal transduction pathways mediated by these secretagogues (Oda et al., 1991; Kuver et al., 1994). Intracellular cAMP increased in response to Prostaglandin E1, Prostaglandin E2, vasoactive intestinal peptide, epinephrine, and isoproterenol. Assay of mucin secretion showed that the same secretagogues led to an increase in mucin secretion (Kuver et al., 1994).\r\n\r\nMore recently, we demonstrated that bile salts play an important role in the regulation of mucin secretion by these cultured dog gallbladder epithelial cells (Klinkspoor et al., 1995). Bile salts were shown to have a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on mucin secretion. Hydrophobic bile salts were found to be more potent stimulators of mucin secretion than hydrophilic bile salts. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of bile salts on mucin secretion could not be ascribed to a cytolytic effect of the bile salts. Bile salts were shown to stimulate mucin secretion, without causing a concomitant increase in intracellular cAMP or Ca2+ levels in these cells. Phorbol esters, such as PMA, were found to be as effective as bile salts in causing mucin hypersecretion by the gallbladder cells. However, our studies provided no evidence that bile salts act on mucin secretion by means of a direct activation of protein kinase C'",2
"b'N-Linked biantennary and triantennary oligosaccharides containing multiple terminal GalNAc Lex (GalNAc\xdf1\x964[Fuc-{alpha}1\x963]GlcNAc) determinants were radioiodinated and their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and hepatic cellular localization were determined in mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed GalNAc Lex biantennary and triantennary oligosaccharides had a similar mean residence time and steady-state volume of distribution but differed in their total body clearance rate due a shorter {alpha} half-life for GalNAc Lex triantennary. Biodistribution and whole-body-autoradiography studies revealed that both GalNAc Lex terminated biantennary and triantennary oligosaccharides predominately targeted to the liver, which accumulated 72% and 79% of the dose 30 min after administration, respectively. Separation of mouse liver parenchymal from non-parenchymal cells demonstrated both N-glycans were almost exclusively (94%) taken up by the parenchymal cells. By comparison, GalNAc terminated biantennary and triantennary N-glycans accumulated in the liver with a targeting efficiency of 73% and 81%, respectively. It is concluded that GalNAc and GalNAc Lex terminated N-glycans are recognized in vivo with equivalent affinity by the murine hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor.'",2
"b'The gastric H/K ATPase [beta]-subunit, an abundant glycoprotein of the secretory membranes of gastric parietal cells, is the major autoantigen recognized by human parietal cell autoantibodies in gastric autoimmunity. Our previous studies demonstrated that the human autoantibodies recognize the H/K ATPase [beta]-subunit from a number of species and that glycosylation of the [beta]-subunit with complex N-glycans is required for autoantibody binding. The N-glycans of the [beta]-subunit contain polylactosamine chains. The lactosamine chains of the rabbit [beta]-subunit are terminated with [alpha]-linked galactosyl residues ([alpha]-galactosyl epitope) (Tyagarajan et al., Biochemistry, 1996, 35, 3238-3246). Here we have investigated the expression of [alpha]-galactosyl epitopes on the H/K ATPase [beta]-subunit from a number of species. Using the [alpha]-galactosyl binding lectin, BS1-IB4, and naturally occurring anti-[alpha]-galactosyl antibodies, we have demonstrated that the rat H/K ATPase [beta]-subunit also contains terminal [alpha]-galactosyl residues, but not the [beta]-subunit from pig, dog, and mouse, indicating species-specific differences in the terminal saccharide sequences of the [beta]-subunit. We also investigated the potential contribution of the [alpha]-galactosyl epitopes to the binding by human sera. The reactivity of human pernicious anemia serum with gastric parietal cells could not be inhibited with saccharide inhibitors and, in addition, no binding was observed with normal human sera. We conclude that the H/K ATPase [beta]-subunit oligosaccharides from rabbit and rat are terminated with [alpha]-galactosyl epitopes, and although the presence of this epitope does not contribute to binding by human parietal cell autoantibodies at the concentrations routinely used, it is recommended that neither rat or rabbit stomachs be used for screening human sera.'",2
"b'The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of naltrexone treatment for 21 consecutive days on short-term memory in ethanol-preferring and non-preferring outbred rats. Methods: Ethanol preferring, non-preferring and control Wistar rats were treated with naltrexone [0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)] for 21 consecutive days. Short-term memory was assessed by using an olfactory social recognition test. Results: A single administration of naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) to non-ethanol-treated animals facilitated social memory, whereas the drug did not affect short-term memory in either group of chronically ethanol-treated rats. Multiple naltrexone treatment also lowered alcohol intake in ethanol-preferring rats. Conclusion: Naltrexone\x96ethanol interaction does not seem to produce any negative effect on the short-term memory in outbred rats.'",0
"b'By using slice cultures of hippocampus as a model, we have studied the development of dendritic spines in fascia dentata granule cells. We raised the question as to what extent spine development is dependent on a major afferent input to these neurons, the fibers from the entorhinal cortex and neuronal activity mediated by these axons. Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) the entorhino-hippocampal projection develops in an organotypic manner in co-cultures of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Like in vivo, entorhinal fibers, labeled by anterograde tracing with biocytin, terminate in the outer molecular layer of the fascia dentata. (ii) The layer-specific termination of entorhinal fibers is not altered by the blockade of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. Likewise, the differentiation of the dendritic arbor of postsynaptic granule cells does not require neuronal activity. Blockade of neuronal activity did not affect the mean spine number of granule cell dendrites in entorhino-hippocampal co-cultures, but led to a relative increase in thin, long filiform spines that are characteristic of immature neurons. (iii) The maturation of the granule cell dendritic arbor is, however, controlled by the afferent fibers from the entorhinal cortex in an activity-independent manner. In single slice cultures of hippocampus lacking entorhinal input, Golgi-impregnated granule cells have much shorter, less branched dendrites when compared with granule cells in entorhino-hippocampal co-cultures. This reduction in dendritic length in granule cells lacking entorhinal input results in a lower mean total number of spines per neuron, but the mean number of spines per \xb5m is not reduced in the absence of entorhinal innervation. These results indicate that innervation by fibers from the entorhinal cortex, but not neuronal activity mediated via these axons, is essential for the normal development of the granule cell dendritic arbor. Neuronal activity is required, however, for the maturation of dendritic spines.'",1
"b'To characterize the T cells involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (CM) induced by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA clone 1.49L (PbA 1.49L), the occurrence of the disease was assessed in mice lacking T cells of either the {alpha}\xdf or {gamma}{delta} lineage (TCR{alpha}\xdf\x96/\x96 or TCR{gamma}{delta}\x96/\x96). TCR{gamma}{delta}\x96/\x96 mice were susceptible to CM, whereas all TCR{alpha}\xdf\x96/\x96 mice were resistant, suggesting that T cells of the {alpha}\xdf lineage are important in the genesis of CM. The repertoire of TCR V\xdf segment gene expression was examined by flow cytometry in B10.D2 mice, a strain highly susceptible to CM induced by infection with PbA 1.49L. In these mice, CM was associated with an increase of T cells bearing the V\xdf8.1, 2 segments in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. Most V\xdf8.1, 2+ T cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the mice that developed CM belonged to the CD8 subset, and exhibited the CD69+, CD44high and CD62Llow phenotype surface markers. The link between the increase in V\xdf8.1, 2+ T cells and the neuropathological consequences of PbA infection was strengthened by the observation that the occurrence of CM was significantly reduced in mice treated with KJ16 antibodies against the V\xdf8.1 and V\xdf8.2 chains, and in mice rendered deficient in V\xdf8.1+ T cells by a mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen.'",4
"b""Using an `oligoclonal' model, we have previously shown that mice transgenic for a \xb5 chain (H3) and deficient for {kappa} chain expression display a mature B cell repertoire largely dominated by the H3/{lambda}1 pair, while the four H3/{lambda} available combinations can be observed in the immature B cell compartment. This led us to propose the existence of a positive selection process. To test this hypothesis, we have introduced the SJL {lambda} locus coding for a defective {lambda}1 chain ({lambda}1s) that creates a dysfunctional Ig receptor complex during B cell differentiation. Our results show that the {lambda}1s defect impairs the development of mature B cells when the H3-\xb5 transgene insert is present in the hemizygous state. This suggests that the Gly -> Val substitution present in the C{lambda}1s chain at position 155 is sufficient to abrogate the selection of the H3/{lambda}1 pair. Unexpectedly, when the H3-\xb5 transgene array is present in a homozygous state in {lambda}1s mice but not in `wild-type' {lambda}1 mice ({lambda}1+), a significant number of mature B cells expressing all H3/{lambda} combinations can be developed. These results indicate that the overriding H3/{lambda}1 dominance observed in {lambda}1+ mice is due to a positive selection process and not to a negative selection of other H3/{lambda} combinations. They also show that the export of B cells to the periphery can be controlled by the expression of the \xb5 chain.""",4
"b'Cajal\x96Retzius (CR) cells were discovered at the end of the 19th century but, surprisingly, the exploration of their physiological properties is only now beginning, as we near the end of the 20th century. A few papers addressing these properties have appeared recently, but incomplete data generally give the arguably misleading impression that CR cells are similar to other neocortical neurons, and therefore may perform analogous functions. It is one of the motives of this review to dispel such conceptions. Although CR cells display features of \x91regular\x92 neurons, including excitability and responsiveness to neurotransmitters, their function is probably limited to the primary implementation of cortical circuits. A strong indication in support of this idea is the fact that CR cells appear at the onset of neocorticogenesis and disappear at the end of neuronal migration.'",1
"b""The global burden of stroke is huge: it is the third-ranked cause of death, affects 5.5 million people a year, and is responsible for 50 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs). Over the next 20 years, stroke will rise from 7th in the DALY league table to 4th, influenced largely by the ageing of populations in less economically developed countries. However, as acknowledged by Colin Mathers, World Health Organization global burden of disease project, these estimates are based on mortality statistics covering only 34% of the world's population and extremely patchy disability data. Ruth Bonita, World Health Organization non-communicable disease surveillance section, said that a major priority was to improve stroke surveillance in a stepwise fashion, starting with cardiovascular risk factor surveys and hospital registration of strokes, and moving towards more comprehensive stroke registers covering both urban and rural populations.\r\n\r\nThe decline in stroke mortality in many countries of the world, and its rise in some central and eastern European countries is unexplained by changes in risk factors and only limited secular trend data on incidence are available. Consequently, new data on stroke incidence and case-fatality from MONICA sites are of considerable interest. Case fatality at 28 days varies from 15% to 50% with most of the variation attributable to 7\x9628 day events rather than early brain deaths occurring in the first week. In countries with a declining mortality trend, it is estimated that about two-thirds of the change is explained by falls in case-fatality and the remainder by incidence rate changes. In countries that are experiencing rises in stroke mortality, all the change is attributable to increases in 28 day case-fatality. These findings, if generalizable to non-MONICA settings, are of profound importance, suggesting that medical care may have a greater effect on population stroke burden than we currently suppose. Moreover, with population ageing, even if stroke incidence stays the same, the numbers of stroke patients requiring medical care will rise dramatically over the next two decades. Mortality rates do not appear to be a proxy for incidence.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study, examining the greater mortality among black and Hispanic Americans compared with whites, found similar case-fatality between ethnic groups and concluded that mortality differences reflected incidence differences. A review of stroke in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated how little is known about a condition that appears to be an increasing cause of hospital admission. Without adequate registration of non-communicable diseases in less economically developed countries it does seem that public health policy and practice will remain weak. A clear consensus is emerging amongst the scientific community that better surveillance systems are needed. The next step is for scientists to persuade governments of these countries to request the technical support required which will give the World Health Organisation a mandate to initiate new programmes which will increase our understanding of how best to prevent stroke in the developing world.\r\n\r\nAttempts to examine aetiological hypotheses were marred by poor study design. A study examining the risk associated with raised serum cholesterol managed to avoid a controlled comparison. A study of stroke risk associated with H. pylori, subjected patients to an unneeded (and probably unethical) endoscopy, and compared serum levels of Helicobacter pylori IgG antibodies with controls suffering gastro-intestinal symptoms. Perhaps not surprisingly, no increased risk of stroke was found in those with high H. pylori levels. And a study demonstrating endothelial dysfunction in ischaemic stroke patients without risk factors failed to recognise that for continuously distributed risk factors, there is no level commensurate with \x91no risk\x92. No new gene polymorphisms appeared to be important in stroke: neither the alpha or beta fibrinogen gene polymorphisms were related to carotid stenosis, nor was a SNP in the beta-2 glycoprotein 1 gene relevant in cerebral infarction. The \x91hot\x92 poster topic was a Japanese study examining haemorrhagic strokes occurring after sexual intercourse\x97just over half were associated with sex in extramarital relationships.\r\n\r\nThe major thrusts in stroke trials that will provide evidence to test aetiological hypotheses were studies of statins (PROSPER, RESPECT trials) and B6, B12 and folate (VITATOPS trial) in secondary prevention of stroke. Acute trials, while increasing in sample size, are still failing to find a safe neuroprotective agent. The Third International Stroke trial (the first examined the role of aspirin and heparin in acute stroke, the second is examining feeding regimens) has been established to test whether intravenous thrombolysis could be more widely used.\r\n\r\nThe 4th World Stroke Congress received 1300 delegates from 64 countries, and covered an extensive range of topics from basic science to rehabilitation. The meeting was weak in aetiological epidemiology and practical public health interventions, but provided a strong platform for reinforcing the need to have good data on stroke burdens as a prerequisite for public health. The National Stroke Foundation of Australia (http://www.strokefoundation.com.au) organized a meeting of national stroke associations at the start of the Congress with the aim of establishing a World Stroke Association which would aim to improve awareness of stroke, raise standards of prevention and care, and help establish national stroke associations in those countries without such bodies. This initiative deserves support as it will provide a means by which the burden of stroke may be reduced.""",3
"b'DNA vaccination offers the advantages of viral gene expression within host cells without the risks of infectious virus. Like viral vaccines, DNA vaccines encoding internal influenza virus proteins can induce immunity to conserved epitopes and so may defend the host against a broad range of viral variants. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been described as essential effectors in protection by influenza nucleoprotein (NP), although a lesser role of CD4+ cells has been reported. We immunized mice with plasmids encoding influenza virus NP and matrix (M). NP + M DNA allowed B6 mice to survive otherwise lethal challenge infection, but did not protect B6-\xdf2m(\x96/\x96) mice defective in CD8+ CTL. However, this does not prove CTL are required, because \xdf2m(\x96/\x96) mice have multiple immune abnormalities. We used acute T cell depletion in vivo to identify effectors critical for defense against challenge infection. Since lung lymphocytes are relevant to virus clearance, surface phenotypes and cytolytic activity of lung lymphocytes were analyzed in depleted animals, along with lethal challenge studies. Depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in NP + M DNA-immunized BALB/c mice during the challenge period did not significantly decrease survival, while simultaneous depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells or depletion of all CD90+ cells completely abrogated survival. We conclude that T cell immunity induced by NP + M DNA vaccination is responsible for immune defense, but CD8+ T cells are not essential in the active response to this vaccination. Either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells can promote survival and recovery in the absence of the other subset.'",4
"b'Scotland, England and Wales, and Ireland have each recently reviewed how licensing laws might influence the increasing levels of alcohol-related problems in each of these countries. Each legislature has arrived at somewhat different recommendations. Scotland may move towards liberalization, albeit within firm guidelines.

"b'Alcohol is increasingly being recognized as a major cause of the greater burden of disease and premature death in eastern Europe than in the west. This requires a robust policy response but, in most countries in the region, there is little empirical data on patterns of consumption on which to base such a response. Until now, there has been no information on prevalence of drinking among the Bulgarian population. This paper describes a survey that seeks to address this weakness by describing the pattern of drinking in Bulgaria and its relationship with socio-demographic factors. It uses a multivariate analysis of data on patterns of alcohol consumption from a multi-stage nationwide survey of 1550 adults in Bulgaria, in 1997 which found that overall 50.7% of men and 13.6% of women drink at least weekly. In both sexes, drinking is least common among the elderly and those living in villages. It is also less common among those reporting their financial status as poor. Muslims are less likely to drink than are orthodox Christians. Drinking is most common among those living in cities, with higher education and high incomes. Heavy drinking, defined as 80 g/day or more, is rare among women, but is ascribed to 18.2% of men. Heavy drinking was much more common among men living in Sofia and was less common among those whose financial situation was poor. At the levels of drinking reported, it can be expected that alcohol is making a substantial contribution to the burden of disease and premature mortality in Bulgaria. A coordinated, effective policy response is required. Although some of the legal prerequisites are in place, they are poorly enforced and there is no overall strategy to address this issue.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Recent literature documents extensive substance misuse histories among US female prison inmates. The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether histories of personal and familial substance misuse distinguished female inmates from substance misusers in treatment. After accounting for drug-related offences, we hypothesized that the inmates would have more extensive histories of personal and familial substance misuse and that they would have initiated substance use at an earlier age. Contrary to our expectations, the two samples were similar on many measures of alcohol and drug use. Similarly, differences in family histories of substance misuse were not in the predicted direction. As hypothesized, however, the inmates did report earlier age at onset of drinking. Of particular clinical relevance was the finding that, despite similar alcohol consumption levels, inmates reported fewer alcohol-related adverse medical, legal, and psychosocial consequences than did the treatment sample.'",0
"b'The orbitofrontal cortex (OfC) is a heterogeneous prefrontal sector selectively connected with a wide constellation of other prefrontal, limbic, sensory and premotor areas. Among the limbic cortical connections, the ones with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are particularly salient. Sensory cortices connected with the OfC include areas involved in olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. Subcortical structures with prominent OfC connections include the amygdala, numerous thalamic nuclei, the striatum, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, and biochemically specific cell groups in the basal forebrain and brainstem. Architectonic and connectional evidence supports parcellation of the OfC. The rostrally placed isocortical sector is mainly connected with isocortical areas, including sensory areas of the auditory, somatic and visual modalities, whereas the caudal non-isocortical sector is principally connected with non-isocortical areas, and, in the sensory domain, with olfactory and gustatory areas. The connections of the isocortical and non-isocortical orbital sectors with the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter are also specific. The medial sector of the OfC is selectively connected with the hippocampus, posterior parahippocampal cortex, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial areas, and area prostriata, while the lateral orbitofrontal sector is the most heavily connected with sensory areas of the gustatory, somatic and visual modalities, with premotor regions, and with the amygdala.'",1
"b'The Scientific Institute for the Research into the Hazards of Tobacco (F\xfchrer in health Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren) was founded on 5 April 1941 at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena in the presence of political dignitaries such as the Reichsgesundheitsf\xfchrer (regional party leader), Leonardo Conti, and the Regional Minister and Gauleiter of Thuringia, Fritz Sauckel.1\x965 The Institute was the first of its kind worldwide. The inaugural ceremony was a festive occasion held in the main lecture theatre to the accompaniment of an orchestra playing Mozart. The President of the Reichsgesundheitsamt (Office of Public Health) of the Third Reich, Professor Hans Reiter gave the keynote address.6 He thanked Gauleiter Sauckel for his valuable personal efforts in setting up the Institute. The racial hygienist and Professor of Medicine, Karl Astel who was the Dean of the University of Jena and headed both the Office for Racial Affairs and the Office for Public Health and Social Affairs of the State of Thuringia, however, was the driving force and chairman of the Institute. Astel had earlier described abstinence from smoking as a \x91national-socialist duty\x92 and was himself a militant non-smoker. Addressing ""His Magnificence Prof. Dr Astel"", Reiter said that \x91by carrying out your plan, you have cleared a way through the undergrowth of objections put forward by selfish people which will become broader and broader in the future\x92. Please nurture this project which may save the German Volk hundreds of thousands of valuable workers.6\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the foundation of the Institute was part of a conference on the \x91Tabakgefahr\x92 (the hazard of tobacco) which took place under the auspices of Reichsgesundheitsf\xfchrer Conti in Weimar. On the occasion of this conference and the foundation of the Institute, Fritz Sauckel and Leonardo Conti telegraphed greetings to the F\xfchrer in Berlin. Adolf Hitler replied: \x91I am very grateful for the telegram received from the First Scientific Conference for Research into the Dangers of Tobacco and the official opening of the Scientific Institute which will serve these purposes in Jena. In reply to your greetings, I send my best wishes for your work which will liberate mankind from one of its most dangerous poison\x92.6\x967\r\n\r\nBest wishes were not the only support provided by Hitler. He made a donation of over 100 000 RM out of his personal resources to fund the establishment of the Jena Institute.6,8\r\n\r\nThe anti-smoking campaign in Thuringia\r\n\r\nThe developments at the university were accompanied by a massive campaign against smoking in Thuringia, which was under the auspices of Gauleiter Sauckel. For example, smoking in public by women under 25 years of age was prohibited.9 Within the framework of this campaign Astel banned smoking at the University of Jena on 1 May 1941. As Head of the Department of Public Health of the State of Thuringia, he subsequently also prohibited smoking in all hospitals, polyclinics and other health institutions. However, this campaign was not undisputed. Goebbel\'s Ministry of Propaganda agreed in principle, but considered that a nationwide campaign in the mass media would not be feasible because authorities such as teachers and doctors were setting a bad example by smoking themselves. Furthermore, leading figures in party and state, including Reichsmarschall G\xf6ring, indulged in tobacco in public.9 The Ministry argued that if the campaign was unsuccessful and had to be abandoned, the enforcing authorities would make fools of themselves. In general a campaign against smoking was not considered to be sensible in wartime.9 It is unclear to what extent the efforts in Thuringia, which had been conducted with the special agreement of Hitler, had been successful, but the campaign\'s success was probably modest at best.3,4\r\n\r\nThe research at the Institute\r\n\r\nThe work at the Institute was hampered by a lack of resources: the Institute never had its own premises and laboratories or staff, but was entirely dependent on the contributions made by other researchers at University of Jena, for example the Chair of Physiology, Professor Emil von Skramlik. In 1942, in a letter addressed to the racial hygienist, Professor G\xfcnther Just, Skramlik wrote: \x91As you know a Scientific Tobacco Institute has been set up in Jena in 1941 under the leadership of Councillor of State Professor Karl Astel, Dean of the Freidrich-Schiller University. I am heading the Department of Physiology at this Institute\x92.10\r\n\r\nJust immediately became involved in the research activities of the Institute and in 1943 received a total of 3000 RM from the Institute\'s resources for experimental work.11 It is uncertain what research Emil von Skramlik performed in the Institute\'s Department of Physiology. It is clear from administrative records, however, that the Institute performed smoking trials in volunteers: on 20 October 1941, a \x91Mr L\x92 from Jena wrote an invoice for 12 RM for \x91smoking trials performed in June 1941\x92.12 Little is known about these trials which continued to be part of the research programme of the Institute at least until summer 1942. It was Astel\'s wish that the findings from the research should be disseminated in collaboration with Emil von Skramlik in a \x91Kulturfilm\x92 (documentary to be shown in cinemas). Von Skramlik built on documentaries of the poisonous effects of nicotine on marine animals he had shot previously.2 Unfortunately the material could not be traced after the war.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physiologist von Skramlik, other physicians from Jena examined the effects of nicotine on the organism. Dietrich von Keiser from the Department of Surgery examined the effects of nicotine on stomach action. In 1943 these studies were accepted as von Keiser\'s \x91habilitation\x92 at the University, a qualification which authorised him to teach at the University.13 Unfortunately the relevant documents can no longer be located, but we do know that von Keiser intended to examine 400 volunteers, mainly SA men.14 The report of the referee state that von Keiser X-rayed 300 people and found differences in the secretion of stomach juices and stomach peristalsis between smokers and non-smokers.15 The pathologist Professor Eberhard Schairer16 performed animal experiments with the support of the Tobacco Institute and, together with his doctoral student Erich Sch\xf6niger, mounted an epidemiological investigation into the connection between smoking and lung cancer.\r\nSch\xf6niger was not the only doctoral student working on tobacco-related issues. Between 1942 and 1945, seven doctoral theses dealing with the effects of tobacco and nicotine were completed at the Medical Faculty (Table 1Go). However, only three of these can unequivocally be attributed to the Tobacco Institute. It is unclear how many other students worked on tobacco-related theses but never submitted their work.\r\n\r\nThe first of the series of seven theses was entitled \x91The woman smoker\x92 and was submitted in 1942 by Gabriele Schulz and K\xe4te Dischner. In addition to Astel, the Chair of Psychiatry, Professor Berthold Kihn co-supervised the dissertation which, with 127 pages, was rather more substantial than usual. The two students formulated the rationale for their study as follows: \x91In relation to the guidance of our people in health matters, which is of particular importance now that we are at war, the issue of smoking is clearly an important issue for discussion ... The findings from scientific research have documented the harmful effects of tobacco on the nation, however a large proportion of the German people has not yet been able to give up smoking\x92. The thesis should support women, \x91who as the carriers of life should be at the forefront of promoting health\x92, in their decision to quit smoking. The two students interviewed a total of 175 female smokers in order to document the negative consequences of smoking. Their sample included 75 women prisoners, some of them political prisoners, in three penal institutions in central Germany. Access to these women was \x91kindly facilitated\x92 by Astel.\r\nWerner Feuerstein, a soldier who had been ordered to study medicine and who was a member of a student battalion in Jena, completed a thesis on \x91Nicotine deaths over the past 100 years\x92 in 1943. He examined 56 recorded deaths due to nicotine poisoning, including accidental deaths after ingestion of pesticides, murders and suicides related to nicotine ingestion. Heinz Held, on the other hand, investigated \x91the effects of nicotine on the ion ratio of potassium and calcium in the human body\x92 in a dissertation completed in 1944. In his introduction he wrote \x91with the firm commitment of the leaders of our state to form healthy and strong future generations who can take on the great tasks of the future, the issue of nicotine has become the focus of attention\x92. Rolf Schroder\'s thesis from 1944 on \x91The neurological damage inflicted by tobacco. Compilation of known cases\x92 documents that neurologists and psychiatrists had developed an interest in the \x91Tabakgefahr\x92.\r\n\r\nIn 1944 the first thesis to be performed under the direct responsibility of the Tobacco Institute was completed. It was an experimental piece of work which dealt with \x91the effect of nicotine on worms\x92. The experiments were performed by the student Lore Wenzel under the supervision of Emil von Skramlik. In a further dissertation which was submitted in 1944 by Maria Schumann, the poisonous effects of nicotine in white mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and frogs which had been kept in a smoke-filled room for extended periods of time were described. Emil von Skramlik again supervised this work. The scientifically most important thesis is of course the study by Erich Sch\xf6niger. Sch\xf6niger worked under the supervision of the pathologist, Eberhard Schairer16 on \x91Lung cancer and tobacco consumption\x92. Their results were published in \x91Zeitschrift f\xfcr Krebsforschung\x92 in 194317 before the thesis was submitted in 1944. This landmark study is published for the first time in English in this issue of the journal.19\r\n\r\nA number of scientists from outside the University of Jena contributed to research at the Institute. In addition to G\xfcnther Just, other scientists such as the Director of the Institute for Racial Hygiene at the German University in Prague, Professor Karl Thurns and the pharmacologist, Professor Gustav Kuschinsky, also from Prague, conducted research in collaboration with the Institute and received financial support from the Institute. Karl Astel also invited one of the best known tobacco researchers of the time, Fritz Lickint, to collaborate with the Institute.20 The gynaecologist, Paul Bernhard from Duisburg, made use of the focus on tobacco at the University of Jena and submitted his habilitation on \x91The effects of tobacco poisons on the health and fertility of the woman\x92 in January 1942. The process was successfully concluded in March 1942 and the revised version of Bernhard\'s text was published less than a year later.21\r\n\r\nDespite all the activities of Karl Astel, the Scientific Institute for Research into the Dangers of Tobacco achieved only marginal scientific significance and reputation. Astel committed suicide ten days before the end of the war, presumably to avoid facing the consequences of his activities as a leading racial hygienist in the Third Reich and the Institute was disbanded and remained forgotten for half a century.'",3
"b'This study evaluated the role of personality in the short-term outcome of alcohol/substance-use disorder patients. Detoxifying alcohol/substance-use disorder patients were administered the Myers\x96 Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST), the CAGE Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). These patients were subsequently evaluated over a 1-month period for relapse and attendance at self-help group meetings. High TPQ Persistence scale scores predicted abstinence. When the Thinking and Feeling groups were considered separately, and when these two groups were combined into a single group, high scores for the individual groups and the combined group (i.e. Thinking and Feeling types together) predicted abstinence. High TPQ Persistence scale scores and low Shyness with Strangers and Fear of Uncertainty subscale scores predicted attendance at self-help group meetings. High MBTI Extroversion and high MBTI Thinking scores also predicted attendance at self-help group meetings. When the Extroverted and Introverted types and the Thinking and Feeling types respectively were combined, as with abstinence, high scores predicted attendance at self-help group meetings. Age, gender, CAGE, MAST, and BDI scores did not predict outcome. The above information suggests that specific personality variables may predict abstinence and attendance at self-help group meetings in recently detoxified alcoholics, and this may have prognostic and therapeutic significance.'",0
"b'Numerous investigators have postulated that one mechanism by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) may evade the immune system is through the formation of escape mutants. This hypothesis is based largely on the observed mutability of the viral genome resulting in evolution of diverse quasispecies over the course of infection. That such diversification is a product of viral RNA polymerase infidelity, immune-driven selection or a combination of the two processes has not been addressed. We have examined sequence variability in a specific segment of HCV RNA encoding a known immunodominant region of the viral helicase, amino acids 358\x96375 of the non-structural 3 protein. Using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization and automated DNA sequencing, we report a high frequency of mutations, essentially all of which result in amino acid replacements. To assess the biological impact of such mutations, corresponding chemically synthesized peptides were compared to wild-type peptide in T cell proliferation assays. We observed that a sizeable fraction of such peptides stimulated attenuated or negligible levels of proliferation by peripheral T cells from a chronically infected patient. This observation is consistent with expectations for immune-mediated selection of escape variants at the epitope level. We postulate that such a mechanism may be important in the immunopathogenesis of HCV infections.'",4
"b'he possible relationship between postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function, as assessed by the growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine (CLON) and aspects of mental well-being by self-report of mood using the Swedish Mood Adjective Check List, was investigated in alcohol-dependent patients in the early withdrawal period. Patients had blunted GH responses to CLON and worse mental well-being than control subjects immediately after the end of alcohol intake. No relation was found between mental well-being and postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function. After 1 week, the GH responses to CLON remained blunted, whereas the state of mental well-being had improved to levels similar to those of control subjects. The results further support a downregulated {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function during 1 week of alcohol withdrawal. Furthermore, even if subsensitive postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function was not generally related to state of mood, patients with the lowest postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function reported the highest levels in the dimensions pleasantness/unpleasantness and activation/deactivation when sober.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'As cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) induction was related to oxidative stress in experimental models, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CYP2E1 activity and markers of oxidative stress in 40 alcoholic patients entering a rehabilitation programme. Plasma oxidized proteins, lipid peroxides (LPO) and antibodies against hydroxyethyl radical (HER) or malondialdehyde (MDA) adducts were assessed as markers of the production of free radicals, whereas vitamin E levels were evaluated as a marker of the antioxidant defence. CYP2E1 activity was determined by using the 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone:chlorzoxazone blood metabolic ratio, 2 h after drug intake. This ratio was increased by 4-fold in alcoholics, compared to non-alcoholic patients, and was correlated with daily intake of ethanol, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, and blood alcohol level at the time of admission to hospital. Plasma levels of LPO and oxidized proteins were slightly increased (20%) in alcoholic patients when compared with the control group, whereas those of vitamin E were found to be slightly decreased (by 18%). Antibodies against HER or MDA adducts showed a very significant increase. However, when alcoholic patients were divided into two groups according to low or high CYP2E1 induction, no significant difference was observed in the variation of these parameters, except for anti-HER adducts antibodies. Therefore, our study confirms the main involvement of CYP2E1 in HER production. By contrast, CYP2E1 does not appear to be the main factor responsible for the oxidative stress occurring during human chronic alcoholism. Free radicals from other sources may therefore contribute significantly to the generation of this oxidative stress.'",0
"b""Background Studies in developed countries have shown that reduced fetal growth is related to raised blood pressure in childhood and adult life. Little is known about this association in developing countries, where fetal growth retardation is common.\r\n\r\nMethods In 1994\x961995, we measured blood pressure in 1570 3\x966-year-old children living in China, Guatemala, Chile, Nigeria and Sweden. We related their blood pressure to patterns of fetal growth, as measured by body proportions at birth. The children were all born after 37 weeks gestation and weighed more than 2.5 kg at birth.\r\n\r\nResults In each country, blood pressure was positively related to the child's current weight. After adjusting for this and gender, systolic pressure was inversely related to size at birth in all countries except Nigeria. In Chile, China and Guatemala, children who were proportionately small at birth had raised systolic pressure. For example, in Chile, systolic pressure adjusted for current weight increased by 4.9 mmHg (95% CI : 2.1, 7.7) for every kilogram decrease in birthweight, by 1 mmHg (95% CI : 0.4, 1.6) for every centimetre decrease in birth length, and by 1.3 mmHg (95% CI : 0.4, 2.2) for every centimetre decrease in head circumference at birth. In Sweden, systolic pressure was higher in children who were disproportionately small, that is thin, at birth. Systolic pressure increased by 0.3 mmHg (95% CI : 0.0, 0.6) for every unit (kg/m3) decrease in ponderal index at birth. These associations were independent of the duration of gestation.\r\n\r\nConclusions Raised blood pressure among children in three samples from China, Central and South America is related to proportionate reduction in body size at birth, which results from reduced growth throughout gestation. The relation between fetal growth and blood pressure may be different in African populations. Proportionately reduced fetal growth is the prevalent pattern of fetal growth retardation in developing countries, and is associated with chronic undernutrition among women. Improvement in the nutrition and health of girls and young women may be important in preventing cardiovascular disease in developing countries.""",3
"b'This Commentary reviews the report from the Working Group on the Misuse of Alcohol and Other Drugs by Doctors, and considers the response of a Scottish region to it. The report confirms that alcohol and drug misuse in doctors is a threat to patients and that the problem in doctors is not being addressed satisfactorily. Support for the establishment of dedicated services is outlined. Local enquiries confirmed that the reported conclusions were universally supported, but extensive work was required to incorporate the issues into student teaching, postgraduate training, continuing professional education, and future revalidation procedures. A proposal to establish a local, confidential, anonymous, informal contact point is outlined to promote early intervention and limit the development of entrenched morbidity relating to substance misuse. The intention is to monitor the utility of that arrangement by audit.'",0
"b'Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) are the hallmark of systemic autoimmune diseases. Yet, the in vivo function of ANA remains controversial to a large extent due to the intracellular nature of their antigenic targets. It has been reported that a subset of autoantibodies can penetrate live cells and translocate into the subcellular compartments containing the corresponding antigens. The studies presented herein show that murine anti-Sm and anti-La monoclonal autoantibodies can also enter a variety of cell types from different animal species and that the cell penetration activity is not isotype-restricted. Interestingly, only mAb with cross-reactivity against double-stranded DNA did enter cells. Both these autoantibodies rapidly accumulate in the nucleus of viable cells but display different penetration kinetics. In co-localization experiments, monoclonal autoantibodies did not accumulate significantly within endocytic vesicles containing dextran, suggesting that they are internalized by mechanisms distinct from conventional receptor-mediated endocytosis. This report represents the first evidence that anti-La and anti-Sm autoantibodies are capable of entering live cells. Our observations support the notion that the phenomenon of intracellular autoantibodies may have a larger scope than previously reported and are consistent with a potential pathogenic role for ANA.'",4
"b'Although it is well known that B-vitamin deficiencies directly affecting the brain are common in alcohol misuse, no concise guidelines on the use of vitamin supplements in alcohol misusers currently exist in the UK. The purpose of this study was to assess current practice and opinion among UK physicians. Questionnaires were completed by a total of 427 physicians comprising Accident and Emergency (A&E) specialists and psychiatrists, with a response rate of 25%. The main findings were that vitamin deficiency was perceived as being uncommon amongst alcohol misusers (<25%) and there was no consensus as to which B vitamins are beneficial in treatment or the best method of administration of B-vitamin supplementation. The majority of psychiatrists favoured oral administration for prophylaxis against the Wernicke\x96Korsakoff syndrome in chronic alcohol misusers and parenteral therapy in patients with signs of Wernicke\x96Korsakoff syndrome. Whilst only just over half the A&E specialists expressed a preference, most favoured parenteral therapy in both cases. Most respondents did not currently have a unit policy/protocol on the management of vitamin supplementation in chronic alcohol misusers. Overall, the findings suggest that there is wide variation in current practice and highlight the need for guidelines in this area.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b""Extract of the common plant Hypericum perforatum L. (St John's Wort, SJW) has been used successfully for the treatment of mild to moderate depression since ancient times and has recently been studied clinically. Depression and alcoholism have some neurochemical similarities, such as low brain serotonin activities. Thus, we hypothesized that SJW extract, which contains 0.22% hypericin and 4.05% hyperforin, also may be effective in suppressing alcohol intake. To test this hypothesis, the effects of SJW extract on voluntary alcohol intake were studied in two different genetic animal models of human alcoholism: fawn-hooded (FH) and high-alcohol drinking (HAD) rats. FH and HAD rats received a single oral administration (5 ml/kg) of either vehicle or one of the five doses (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg) of SJW extract. The oral administration of SJW extract significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced alcohol intake in both FH and HAD rats. In a third study, FH rats did not develop tolerance to the suppressant effects of SJW on alcohol intake and preference following oral administration of (400 mg/kg) of the extract for 15 consecutive days. These promising findings suggest that SJW extract should be evaluated clinically as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of alcoholism.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b""British adults who were born small for gestational age (birthweight below the fifth percentile for age at birth) in 1970 have academic difficulties that persist into adolescence. As young adults their professional and economic attainment was found to be lower than that of those born at normal birthweight.1 These results were obtained in the largest study to date on the long-term educational and social implications of impaired fetal growth. About 14 000 infants born in one week in the UK were included and more than 50% of them were followed-up for 26 years. Despite the observed differences in academic and professional achievement, the adults who were small at birth were as likely to be employed, married and satisfied with life as their normal birthweight counterparts. These findings raise intriguing questions about the underlying factors that led to the observed disadvantages as well as about their implications for public health world-wide.\r\n\r\nOther studies in adults have failed to show associations between size at birth and adult cognitive performance.2,3 Some studies in children found modest developmental delays in those who had been small at birth, whereas others only found an impact of poor fetal growth on intelligence and motor development if there were large reductions in head circumference.4 An explanation for the absence of an effect of poor fetal growth on cognitive performance in adult life was that the fetus responds to adverse conditions, predominantly undernutrition, by slowing down its growth and preferentially redistributing blood flow towards the head in an attempt to maintain brain development.2 These adaptations to protect the brain may alter the development of organs and tissues in the thorax and the abdomen which in turn might lead to coronary heart disease later in life.5 The results of the 1970 British Birth Cohort study, which focused on more subtle measures of mental and social development than signs of neurological abnormalities or IQ scores used in previous studies, suggests that this brain-sparing mechanism is not completely protective.1\r\n\r\nThe study by Cheung et al., published in this issue, examined the influence of prenatal and postnatal growth on motor development in the first 2 years of life after birth in about 1000 babies born in Lahore in Pakistan.6 It is an important study for several reasons. First, it did not focus on cases with a very low birthweight, but analysed associations with motor development over the entire range of size at birth. Second, not only weight but also length at birth was available, and the study of body proportion provides further insight into fetal responses to adverse intrauterine conditions and their long term consequences. Thirdly, it also looked at the effects of growth in the first 6 months after birth, and brain growth is particularly fast in the months around birth.7 Finally, it studied the development of babies born in a developing country, which is relevant as the effects of adverse intrauterine conditions may vary according to the adequacy of the preconceptual nutritional condition of the mother.\r\n\r\nBabies who were longer or fatter at birth started to walk and to build a 3-cube tower earlier than those who were short or thin. The effect of body length at birth on motor development was particularly clear in babies of below average length. Fast postnatal growth in weight as well as in length led to earlier walking, whereas only fast growth in weight led to early tower building. In other words, thinness and shortness at birth as well as poor postnatal growth seem to be linked to a slower motor development in the first 2 years of life.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier report on the same group of babies, it has been shown that the psychomotor development of Pakistani children born in upper-middle class families and that of children born in industrialized countries is similar, but that the development of children born in slums or a rural village was considerably delayed.8 The results that are reported in this issue demonstrate, although the authors do not deal with this topic explicitly, that the differences in motor development between Pakistani children from different backgrounds persist if size at birth and early postnatal growth is taken into account. Moreover, the reported differences in motor development between children born in a rural village and those from an upper-middle class background are relatively large and correspond to a decrease in either length or weight for length of at least 3 standard deviations. This indicates that environmental factors related to poverty influence motor development in infancy and childhood independently of their effects on size at birth and postnatal growth.\r\n\r\nCheung et al. conclude that being short at birth appeared to be more influential than being thin. Although it is debatable to what extent this conclusion is supported by the data\x97the effects of shortness and thinness seem to be rather similar\x97it points the discussion into the right direction. Birthweight is a rather crude marker of fetal growth, and the study of body proportions at birth might provide a first step towards a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the link between impaired fetal growth and disorders later in life. It is thought that thinness is predominantly an indication of undernutrition during the last trimester of gestation, whereas shortness might indicate undernutrition with an earlier onset.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested by Cheung et al. that \x91interventions to improve fetal and postnatal growth may be helpful in facilitating early child motor development\x92. The key question now is how that can be achieved. In a study in India, body size of newborn babies was strongly predicted by maternal pre-pregnancy weight, which in itself is the result of the mother's prenatal and postnatal development as well as her energy and protein balance in adult life.9 This indicates the importance of interventions to improve the nutrition and growth of girls from early on in their lives. On the other hand, a rapid \x91nutritional transition\x92 within one generation may have disadvantages. A sudden improvement of nutrition will increase the amount of body fat in women who were deprived early on in life but not increase their height. Studies in Finland and India have shown that children of women who were relatively short and fat have an increased risk of coronary heart disease10 and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.11 Finally, as it was found that the children's background was a more important determinant of their development than their growth in utero, the fight against poverty might be more effective than measures that solely focus on the improvement of nutrition for girls and young women. The results of the 1970 British Birth Cohort study indicate, however, that there are links between impaired fetal growth and lower academic and professional achievement even in a highly developed society.""",3
"b'The MG1 population of mucins was isolated from human whole salivas by gel chromatography followed by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. The reduced and alkylated MG1 mucins, separated by anion exchange chromatography, were of similar size (radius of gyration 55-64 nm) and molecular weight (2.5-2.9 \xd7 106 Da). Two differently-charged populations of MG1 subunits were observed which showed different reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to glycan epitopes. Monosaccharide and amino acid compositional analyses indicated that the MG1 subunits had similar glycan structures on the same polypeptide. An antiserum recognizing the MUC5B mucin was reactive across the entire distribution, whereas antisera raised against the MUC2 and MUC5AC mucins showed no reactivity. Western blots of agarose gel electrophoresis of fractions across the anion exchange distribution indicated that the polypeptide underlying the mucins was the product of the MUC5B gene. Amino acid analysis and peptide mapping performed on the fragments produced by trypsin digestion of the two MG1 populations yielded data similar to that obtained for MUC5B mucin subunits prepared from respiratory mucus (Thornton et al., 1997) and confirmed that the MUC5B gene product was the predominant mucin polypeptide present. Isolation of the MG1 mucins from the secretions of the individual salivary glands (palatal, sublingual, and submandibular) indicate that the palatal gland is the source of the highly charged population of the MUC5B mucin.'",2
"b'This mini review surveys the major accomplishments in the field of glycoconjugates research in Japan, which were made after World War II. It describes early movements in the field of glycoconjugate research in Japan, development of the new techniques to investigate structures of the sugar chains of glycoconjugates, studies of the functions of the sugar chain moieties, and the political movement in Japan to support the basic research necessary for the development of glycotechnology. As introduced in this short article, important groundwork for glycobiology was made by Japanese researchers.\r\nOn August 15, 1945, World War II was over. Although great chaos reigned across Japan for many years, natural science in the country had slowly but steadily been recovering from paralysis. In the field of carbohydrate research, major development started by the study of ""homoglycans,"" polysaccharides consisting of only one type of sugar. Jiro Nikuni\x92s group at Osaka University was actively investigating starch, and Choji Araki and Susumu Hirase at Kyoto Technical University were making progress in the study of galactans purified from agar, which was a specialty of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe study of complex carbohydrates was not prosperous, but some groups had already developed the seeds that would grow into excellent programs. Among them, the strongest group was built by Hajime Masamune at Tohoku University School of Medicine. As a professor in the Department of Medical Chemistry, he was examining pathological and biochemical aspects of the glycoconjugates. He trained many excellent students: Zensaku Yoshizawa, Noboru Hiyama, Keisuke Tsurumi, and Sen-itiroh Hakomori. They were scattered as leaders across several universities in the northeast of Japan and built up the focus on glycoconjugate research.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Tansuikabutsu Danwakai, a private workshop on carbohydrate research, was organized by Tomoo Miwa (Tokyo College of Education), Torao Ootsuki (Ochanomizu Women\x92s University), and Susumu Murakami (Saitama University). Although these three leaders were investigating plant carbohydrates and related enzymes, many young researchers of animal glycoconjugates joined in this workshop.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1960s, several other research cores for the study of glycoconjugates were built in Japan. Tamio Yamakawa (glycolipids), Ikuo Yamashina (glycoproteins), Sakaru Suzuki and Kimiko Anno (proteoglycans), Toshiaki Osawa (lectins), and Fujio Egami (glycosidases) were actively developing their programs.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, the 8th International Carbohydrate Symposium, chaired by Konoshin Onodera, professor at Kyoto University, was held at Kyoto. This afforded a good chance to bring together carbohydrate chemists and biochemists scattered in Japan, and a desire to establish a new society for carbohydrate research ran through the country. In 1978, an official workshop of carbohydrate research (renamed as the Japanese Society of Carbohydrate Research in 1987) was founded by the efforts of Akira Misaki and others, and the first annual meeting was held at Nakanoshima, Osaka. Yoshio Matsushima, professor at Osaka University, was elected as the first president. It was fortunate for carbohydrate researchers in Japan that from the start the society included investigators interested in both homoglycans and glycoconjugates.'",2
"b'In deep layers of the cat motor cortex, we have investigated the properties of neurons displaying trans-synaptically induced bursts. In in vivo experiments, extracellularly recorded burst neurons were separated into two subtypes based on their dependence on stimulation sites, the medullary pyramid or the ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nucleus, from which bursts of 10\x9620 spikes were triggered. The spike amplitude attenuation and frequency adaptation during a burst were more prominent in pyramid-dependent burst neurons than in VL-dependent burst neurons. Intracellular recordings in in vivo experiments revealed that pyramid-dependent bursts emerged from a long-lasting depolarization, while each spike during a VL-dependent burst was narrow in half-width and was followed by a fast AHP, similar to fast spiking neurons. In in vitro slice experi- ments, intracellular recordings were obtained from neurons that displayed a burst of attenuated spikes emerging from a long-lasting depolarization, and were also obtained from fast spiking neurons. They were morphologically recovered to be multipolar cells with sparsely spiny dendrites and local axonal networks, suggesting that they are inhibitory interneurons. The multipolar neurons displaying bursts of attenuated spikes may mediate the recurrent inhibition of pyramidal tract cells.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Low platelet monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity and the presence of the Taq1 A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene have independently been proposed as \x91biological/genetic\x92 markers for alcoholism.

The platelet MAO-B activity was significantly lower in individuals with the DRD2 A1 allele (n = 8), compared to those without it (n = 29). This relationship remained unchanged when including only subjects who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence (n = 27). The finding suggests that alcoholics who are carriers of the DRD2 A1 allele may have lower platelet MAO-B activity.'",0
"b""Background To describe the seroepidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection in a population of Egyptian children under 3 years.\r\n\r\nMethods A cohort of children under 36 months, residing in Abu Homos, Egypt, were visited at home twice weekly. Information regarding the child's breastfeeding status was obtained, and periodic anthropometric and household hygiene surveys were performed. In June 1997, a serosurvey was conducted on 187 study participants over 6 months old. The serosurvey was repeated in October 1997. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori.\r\n\r\nResults The June prevalence of H. pylori infection was 10%, and the incidence from June to October was 15%. Between June and October, 8 (42%) of 19 children that were positive for H. pylori infection seroreverted to negative. All seroreversions occurred in children 6\x9617 months. Other than age, no sociodemographic or environmental factor was significantly associated with incident H. pylori infection. There was no significant differences in the weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and height-for-age z-scores between children with and without prevalent H. pylori infection.\r\n\r\nConclusions Infection with H. pylori is common in Egyptian children under 3 years old and is not associated with malnutrition. No predictors for H. pylori infection were found. Our preliminary evidence for transient H. pylori infections in young children needs to be confirmed in a prospective cohort study, and predictors for persistent infection should be sought, since only these may be relevant to the known sequellae of infection.""",3
"b'ntravenous (i.v.) Ig is the human serum Ig fraction that is mainly composed of IgG prepared from plasma pools of over 15,000 healthy blood donors and is suitable for i.v. use. High-dose i.v. Ig is currently used to treat patients with diverse autoimmune conditions. Autoimmunity and malignancy co-exist frequently, and share etiological and pathological mechanisms. Since the two diseases are similarly treated, we studied the efficacy of i.v. Ig as a treatment for malignant conditions. The administration of i.v. Ig to mice inoculated i.v. with melanoma or sarcoma cells induced a statistically significant inhibition of metastatic lung foci and prolongation of survival time. Similar results were seen with SCID mice inoculated with SK-28 human melanoma cells. In a different model, melanoma was induced in the foot pad, followed by leg amputation, after the development of the tumor lesion. A lower number of melanoma recurrences and prolongation of survival time were demonstrated in the i.v. Ig-treated groups. In vitro studies revealed that i.v. Ig was found to stimulate the production of IL-12, an anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic cytokine. Moreover, it enhanced NK cell activity, thus explaining its beneficial effect in SCID mice (which lack B and T but possess NK cells). The results indicate that i.v. Ig acts as an anti-tumor agent. Since it has only minor side effects and is used extensively for other clinical conditions, i.v. Ig may be considered as a potential therapy for the prevention of tumor spread in humans.'",4
"b'Gal[beta]1-3GalNAc (T-disaccharide) and related molecules were assayed to describe the structural requirements of carbohydrates to bind Agaricus bisporus lectin (ABL). Results provide insight into the most relevant regions of T-disaccharide involved in the binding of ABL. It was found that monosaccharides bind ABL weakly indicating a more extended carbohydrate-binding site as compared to those involvedin the T-disaccharide specific lectins such as jacalin and peanut agglutinin. Lacto-N-biose (Gal[beta]1-3GlcNAc) unlike T-disaccharide, is unable to inhibit the ABL interaction, thus showing the great importance of the position of the axial C-4 hydroxyl group of GalNAc in T-disaccharide. This finding could explain the inhibitory ability of Gal[beta]1-6GlcNAc and lactose because C-4 and C-3 hydroxyl groups of reducing Glc, respectively, occupy a similar position as reported by conformational analysis. From the comparison of different glycolipids bearing terminal T-disaccharide bound to different linkages, it can be seen than ABL binding is even more impaired by an adjacent C-6 residual position than by the anomeric influence of T-disaccharide. Furthermore, the addition of [beta]-GlcNAc to the terminal T-disaccharide in C-3 position of Gal does not affect the ABL binding whereas if an anionic group such as glucuronic acid is added to C-3, the binding is partially affected. These findings demonstrate that ABL holds a particular binding nature different from that of other T-disaccharide specific lectins.'",2

"b""Background Comparability of study participants with non-participants is customarily assessed by contrasting the distributions of sociodemographic characteristics. Such comparisons do not necessarily provide insight into whether or not participants of a given subgroup are similar to non-participants of the same subgroup. A geographical information system (GIS) may provide such insight by visually displaying the spatial distributions of participants and non-participants. In a previously reported study of heterosexuals at elevated risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), traditional methods suggested distributional differences in the demographic characteristics of participants and non-participants.\r\n\r\nMethods Based on residential address co-ordinates for each subgroup member, we used the subgroup's centroid as the origin and constructed a 360\xb0 series of overlapping box plots of the distance of subgroups members to the origin, thereby producing closed polygons for each of the box plot demarcators.\r\n\r\nResults These rotational box plots revealed similar geographical distributions for most participant and non-participant subgroups, with the exception of African-American men and women.\r\n\r\nConclusions Observed differences resulted in part from the study design, and provided some insight into sampling problems encountered in social network studies. Based on Tobler's supposition that \x91nearby things tend to be alike\x92, the rotational box plot is a useful additional tool for investigating sample bias.""",3
"b'Recent reports have demonstrated that feeding small amounts of antigen conjugated to the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) suppress immune responses in experimental models of certain Th1-based autoimmune diseases. We have established a model of aerosol sensitization leading to Th2-mediated allergic immune responses in BALB/c mice. In the present study two different antigens, the dietary antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the inhalant allergen Bet v 1 (the major birch pollen allergen), chemically coupled to recombinant CTB were tested for their potential to influence Th2-like immune responses. Intranasal administration of OVA\x96CTB prior to sensitization with OVA led to a significant decrease of antigen-specific IgE antibody levels, but a marked increase of OVA-specific IgG2a antibodies as compared to non-pretreated, sensitized animals. Antigen-specific lympho-proliferative responses in vitro were reduced by 65% in the pretreated group; IL-5 and IL-4, but not IFN-{gamma}, production were markedly decreased in responder cells of lungs and spleens of nasally pretreated mice. In contrast, mucosal administration of rBet v 1\x96CTB conjugates prior to sensitization led to an up-regulation of allergen-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a, increased in vitro lympho-proliferative responses as well as augmented production of IL-5, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-{gamma}. Intranasal administration prior to sensitization of unconjugated allergens showed also contrasting effects: OVA could not significantly influence antigen-specific antibody or cytokine production, whereas intranasal pretreatment with unconjugated Bet v 1 suppressed allergen-specific immune responses in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrated that the two antigens\x97in conjugated as in unconjugated form\x97had different effects on the Th2 immune responses. We therefore conclude that the tolerogenic or immunogenic properties of CTB\x97and probably also other antigen-delivery systems\x97strongly depend on the nature of the coupled antigen\x96allergen.'",4
"b'The rational design of fucosyltransferase (FucT VII) inhibitors as potential medication in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis requires the three-dimensional structure of this member of the glycosyltransferase family. Structure determination by X-ray diffraction analysis needs purified, soluble enzyme protein. For this purpose we developed a novel method for the high-yield production of soluble FucT VII by in vivo proteolysis. To obtain a soluble form of FucT VII a mammalian expression construct was made encoding an N-terminal portion of FucT VI (amino acids 1\x9663) fused with the stem region and catalytic domain of FucT VII (amino acids 39\x96342). Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with this construct produced FucT activity in the supernatant, which has the same catalytic properties as wild-type FucT VII. This soluble form of FucT VII can be obtained in high amounts (1 mg/L) and can be efficiently purified by GDP-hexanolamine affinity chromatography. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the intrinsic properties of FucT VII could be transferred to secreted FucT VII constructs, which may open possibilities for production of soluble forms of other members of the glycosyltransferase family as well.'",2

"b""Approximately 50% of New Zealand Black mice (NZB/BINJ) and 80% of NXSM-D/EiJ mice prenatally develop neocortical layer I ectopias, mostly in somatosensory cortices. These cortical anomalies are similar to those seen in the brains of individuals with dyslexia. Neurofilament staining revealed a radial column of tightly packed fiber bundles in the layers underlying ectopias. This suggested that the connectivity of the ectopic neurons was aberrant. The present study used the tracers 1,1'-dioctadecyl- 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindo- carbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) to more thoroughly explore the cortical and thalamic connectivity of the ectopias. DiI placement into ectopias again revealed a distinct bundle of fibers extending from the ectopic neurons to the deep cortical layers. This bundle split in the white matter with some fibers traveling to the corpus callosum and others to the internal capsule. Thalamic connections were concentrated in the ventrobasal com- plex (VB) and posterior thalamic nucleus group (Po). Injections of BDA into VB revealed reciprocal connections between VB and the ectopic cortical neurons. Ipsilateral corticocortical projections were seen between ectopias in primary somatosensory and motor and secondary somatosensory cortices, but no contralateral connections of the ectopic neurons were seen. These findings confirm the notion that layer I ectopias are anomalously connected by comparison to neurons in homologous cortex, which may underlie widespread dysfunction of brains containing ectopias.\r\n\r\n""",1

Patients aged 20\x9660 years visiting five primary healthcare clinics for any reason were both asked to complete a health questionnaire and interviewed to identify early phase heavy drinkers and to collect sociodemographic and health data. About half of the heavy drinkers (487/1011) complied with a recommendation for brief intervention. Gender, age, drinking variables, smoking, and exercise were associated with compliance. Women and young adults are subgroups of heavy drinkers whose compliance was lower than others and special attention should be given to them when planning brief intervention strategies.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Background Some cross-sectional studies have suggested that age, systolic blood pressure and obesity are positively related to intraocular pressure (IOP), but few longitudinal studies have examined this relationship. This study was carried out to evaluate the association between intraocular pressure and obesity by cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in a large Japanese population.\r\n\r\nMethods Data were collected from annual health examinations between 1989 and 1997 and reviewed retrospectively. Subjects of the cross-sectional analysis were 70 139 males and females aged 14\x9694 years. Among these subjects, 25 216 males and females who had undergone IOP measurements more than three times were analysed longitudinally. The association between IOP and obesity was examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally.\r\n\r\nResults Cross-sectional analysis: The mean IOP at the last visit was 11.6 mmHg. The IOP decreased gradually with age and was significantly higher in males than in females in almost all age groups. Body mass index (BMI) significantly correlated with IOP after controlling for age, gender and blood pressure. Longitudinal analysis: There was a significant association between longitudinal change in IOP and change in weight. This relationship remained significant after controlling for initial BMI, initial blood pressure, change in blood pressure, gender and age.\r\n\r\nConclusion This study showed a significant association between IOP and obesity in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. These findings suggest that obesity is an independent risk factor for increase in IOP.'",3
"b'The present study addressed the relationship between the parameters of saccharin drinking behaviour and locomotor activity in an open field environment and long-term alcohol self-administration. In a 22-day initiation phase, male Wistar rats were presented with increasing concentrations of ethanol (2\x968%, v/v) in a choice with water. The rats were then given the choice between water and two ethanol solutions (8 and 16%). Every 28 days, ethanol was withdrawn for 5 days. The ethanol intake and the transient increase in ethanol consumption after each of six deprivation episodes (alcohol deprivation effect) was monitored and correlated with parameters of the subsequent saccharin drinking and open field tests. The total ethanol intake (g/kg/24 h) as well as the consumption of 16% ethanol were stable over time. However, the magnitude of the alcohol deprivation effect increased with the repeated deprivation episodes. None of the parameters measured in the open field or the saccharin drinking tests correlated with either ethanol consumption or the alcohol deprivation effect. These results suggest that (1) repeated episodes of ethanol deprivation may increase the magnitude of the alcohol deprivation effect, (2) neither saccharin drinking nor locomotor activity correlates with long-term ethanol drinking behaviour in rats.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Immature thymocyte subpopulations were examined for their capacity to differentiate in a newly developed xenogeneic monkey\x96mouse fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) system. We provide evidence for impaired precursor function of CD3\x96CD4+CD8\x96 thymocytes after in vivo infection with SIVmac251 as indicated by a reduced cell number per FTOC and a lower percentage of thymocytes with more mature phenotypes. Addition of recombinant SIV glycoprotein 120 (rgp120) also resulted in a dose-dependent impairment of T cell maturation in FTOC. The data suggest that in patients infected with HIV, T cell maturation and thus replenishment of peripheral pools may be compromised as a result of intrathymic infection or circulating viral gp120.'",4
"b'Alcohol use is typically associated with impaired immunity and increased host susceptibility to infection, partially due to decreased inflammatory response. Acute ethanol exposure has been shown to down-regulate monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the pluripotent transcription factor NF{kappa}B is a pivotal step in the induction of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that alcohol may alter NF{kappa}B activation, thus providing a mechanism for the decreased inflammatory cytokine production by monocytes after acute alcohol treatment. We show here for the first time that alcohol inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF{kappa}B activation in human monocytes by decreasing DNA binding of the p65/p50 heterodimer as seen in electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays. We also demonstrate that alcohol prevents LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and to a lesser extent that of the p50 subunits. NF{kappa}B activation is regulated via phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of I{kappa}B. Thus, we investigated the effect of acute ethanol treatment on I{kappa}B in human monocytes. Alcohol did not prevent LPS-induced I{kappa}B{alpha} degradation but decreased the levels of phospho-specific I{kappa}B{alpha} (Ser32). Finally, for the first time we show that de novo protein synthesis is necessary to bring about the ethanol-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced NF{kappa}B activation. Consequently, these results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations of alcohol interfere with NF{kappa}B activation and thereby may affect the regulation of NF{kappa}B-controlled gene activation.'",4
"b'\xdf-hexosaminidase B is an enzyme that is involved in the degradation of glycolipids and glycans in the lysosome. Mutation in the HEXB gene lead to Sandhoff disease, a glycolipid storage disorder characterized by severe neurodegeneration. So far, little structural information on the protein is available. Here, the complete analysis of the disulfide bond pattern of the protein is described for the first time. Additionally, the structures of the N-glycans are analyzed for the native human protein and for recombinant protein expressed in SF21 cells.\r\n\r\nFor the analysis of the disulfide bond structure, the protein was proteolytically digested and the resulting peptides were analyized by MALDI-MS. The analysis revealed three disulfide bonds (C91\x96C137; C309\x96C360; C534\x96C551) and a free cysteine (C487). The analysis of the N-glycosylation was performed by tryptic digestion of the protein, isolation of glycopeptides by lectin chromatography and mass measurement before and after enzymatic deglycosylation. Carbohydrate structures were calculated from the mass difference between glycosylated and deglycosylated peptide. For \xdf-hexosaminidase B from human placenta, four N-glycans were identified and analyzed, whereas the recombinant protein expressed in SF21 cells carried only three glycans. In both cases the glycosylation belongs to the mannose-core- or high-mannose-type, and some carbohydrate structures are fucosylated.'",2
"b'Effects of thyroid hormone on development of the brain have been documented for over a century. Although in many respects the hypothyroid brain appears morphologically normal, functional impairments include mental retardation, ataxia and spasticity. Keyed by the discovery of nuclear receptors for thyroid hormone that function as transcription factors, recent work has examined the mechanism of thyroid hormone action in brain development. The prediction that gene expression regulated by thyroid hormone is important for mediating brain development has spurred the search for thyroid hormone-responsive genes. Here we review some of the identified genes whose expression patterns correlate with the functional deficits observed in the hypothyroid brain. Recently identified thyroid hormone-responsive genes include synaptotagmin-related gene 1 (Srg1), a putative mediator of synaptic structure and/or activity, and hairless, a transcriptional cofactor that may influence the expression of other thyroid hormone-responsive genes.'",1
"b""Sialyltransferases are enzymes responsible for the important sialylation of glycoconjugates. Since crystal structures are not available, other tools are needed to study enzymatic mechanisms. As a model, we used human {alpha}2,6-sialyltransferase. A putative acceptor-binding domain containing the small and the very small sialyl motifs was randomly mutated. This resulted in enzymes with altered enzymatic activity. Affinity chromatography demonstrated that their binding to donor substrate was maintained. To illustrate the role of the mutated domain in acceptor binding, a method based on surface plasmon resonance was set up. Only at low salt and high acceptor concentration was association of wild-type ST6GalI with asialofetuin demonstrated. As expected, this interaction was affected by cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid, the donor substrate, which proves the specificity of the interaction. Different types of mutants were found. For some, the drop in activity could be explained by loss in affinity for the acceptor. For others, the catalytic center, but not the acceptor-binding site, was affected. Neither acceptor binding nor catalytic activity were limited to the sialyl motifs. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which surface plasmon resonance is successfully used to demonstrate the binding of a glycosyltransferase to its natural acceptor.""",2
"b'The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that superficial and deep layers within a single cerebral region influence cerebral functions and behaviors in different ways. For this test, we selected posterior middle suprasylvian (pMS) sulcal cortex of the cat, a suspected homolog of the area V5 complex of primates, because the region has been implicated in several visually guided behaviors. Cats were trained on three tasks: (1) discrimination of direction of motion; (2) discrimination of static patterns partially obscured by static or moving masks; and (3) visual detection and orienting. Cooling of cryoloops in contact with pMS sulcal cortex to 8 \xb1 1\xb0C selectively and completely impaired performance on the two motion discrimination tasks (1 and 2), while leaving the detection and orienting task (task 3) unimpaired. Further cooling to 3\xb0C resulted in an additional complete impairment of task 3. The 8\xb0C temperature resulted in silencing of neuronal activity in the supragranular layers (I\x96III) and the 3\xb0C temperature silenced activity throughout the thickness of pMS sulcal cortex. The variation in behavioral performance with covariation of cryoloop temperature and vertical, but not lateral, spread of deactivation shows that deactivation of superficial cerebral layers alone was sufficient to completely impair performance on the two motion discrimination tasks, whereas additional deactivation of the deep layers was essential to block performance on the detection and orienting task. Thus, these results show a functional bipartite division of labor between upper and lower cortical layers that is supported by efferent connectional anatomy. Similar bipartite division into upper and lower layers may be a general feature of cerebral cortical architecture, signal processing and guidance of behavior.'",1
"b'To evaluate how often laboratory markers [Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Gamma-glutamyl transferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, Alanine aminotransferase, or Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT)] and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) are used to detect alcohol abuse in primary health care. Methods: Cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey to all 3193 primary health care physicians in Finland. Response rate was (65.7%). Results: CDT was used at least occasionally by 43.4% of the physicians. Corresponding figures were 53.4% for conventional alcohol laboratory markers (MCV, transaminases) and 67.0% for AUDIT. Almost all the respondents used some laboratory marker to detect alcohol abuse. The use of brief alcohol intervention was associated with the greater likelihood that a physician uses different methods to detect alcohol abuse. The data also indicates that gender, age, and having a specialist licence influence activity in using different methods. Conclusions: Considering the ambivalences in relation to alcohol issues in health care, the use of CDT and AUDIT are reasonably frequent. This may indicate that tools to facilitate the work may also help in adapting new activities.'",0
"b'The association between the TCR{alpha}\xdf\x96CD3{gamma}{epsilon}{delta}{epsilon} hexamers and {zeta}2 homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) constitutes a key step in TCR assembly and export to the T cell surface. Incompletely assembled TCR\x96CD3 complexes are degraded in the ER or the lysosomes. A previously described Jurkat variant (J79) has a mutation at position 195 on the TCR C{alpha} domain causing a phenylalanine to valine exchange. This results in a lack of association between TCR{alpha}\xdf\x96CD3{gamma}{epsilon}{delta}{epsilon} hexamers and {zeta}2 homodimers. Two main hypotheses could explain this phenomenon in J79 cells: TCR\x96CD3 hexamers may be incapable of interacting with {zeta}2 due to a structural change in the TCR C{alpha} region; alternatively, TCR\x96CD3 hexamers may be incapable of interacting with {zeta}2 due to factors unrelated to either molecular complex. In order to assess these two possibilities, the TCR\x96CD3 membrane-negative J79 cells were treated with ethylmethylsulfonate and clones positive for TCR membrane expression were isolated. The characterization of the J79r58 phenotypic revertant cell line is the subject of this study. The main question was to assess the reason for the TCR re-expression. The TCR on J79r58 cells appears qualitatively and functionally equivalent to wild-type TCR complexes. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the original mutation in the TCR C{alpha} region but failed to detect compensatory mutations in {alpha}, \xdf, {gamma}, {delta}, {epsilon} or {zeta} chains. Thus, mutated J79-TCR\x96CD3 complexes can interact with {zeta}2 homodimers. Possible mechanisms for the unsuccessful TCR\x96CD3 interaction with {zeta}2 homodimers are presented and discussed.'",4
"b'The papers assembled in this special issue of Cerebral Cortex are part of a continuing dialogue on cellular and molecular aspects of synaptic development and their impact on brain function, which was stimulated by a meeting sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (April 30\x96 May 1, 1998 at the NIH). In recent years, various types of dendritic abnormalities have been described in Down syndrome, fragile-X syndrome, Rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Subtle alterations in dendritic structure or number are precisely the types of abnormalities that would account for a brain that is largely functional, but has subtle deficits in particular cognitive and/or behavioral domains. Remarkable technical advances allow us to focus on the key cellular and molecular events in brain development, synaptic transmission and information processing. This provides us with a unique opportunity to understand the cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with these disorders, and to develop improved therapeutic strategies.\r\n\r\nSeveral papers in this issue address the determinants of dendritic structure during development. Tashiro, Minden and Yuste examine the role of small signaling molecules in hippo-campal development. They use two-photon microscopy to examine the effects of GTPases of the Rho family transfected into cultured pyramidal cells, and describe the acute effects on the density and morphology of dendritic spines. Hormones and other trophic factors also shape dendritic structure, as evidenced by the profound alterations seen in thyroid hormone deficiency disorders. Thompson and Potter examine the classes of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in the brain as a basis for understanding the effect of hormonal deficiencies on neuronal development. Frotscher, Drakew and Heimrich examine the effect of afferent input on dendritic structure. Using hippo-campal neurons co-cultured with entorhinal explants, they show that the granule cell dendritic arbor develops the same laminar specificity in vitro as in vivo, but it is reduced in the absence of entorhinal co-culture. Blockade of afferent activity by tetrodotoxin affects spine morphology on granule cell dendrites but not their density.\r\n\r\nFor several decades, researchers have sought the structural basis of learning and memory. Classic debates have focused on increases in synaptic number versus increasing efficacy of specific synaptic interactions. Three papers in this issue highlight current thinking on structural changes that may provide the basis for functional alterations in neurological pathways. Geinisman reviews changes in the hippocampus associated with long-term potentiation (LTP), a simplified model of memory. Evidence from a number of researchers indicates that LTP is associated with a maturation of synaptic interactions, rather than a net increase in the number of synaptic contacts. Histological studies show a shift from less mature to more mature synaptic profiles, consistent with more efficacious transmission across existing sites and possibly even recruitment of formerly silent synapses. The structural basis of learning is less clear; some studies suggest increases in synaptic number and while others suggest maturation of existing synapses. In a related paper, McAllister reviews studies on the interplay of electrical activity and dendritic structure, which has become a dominant theme in developmental neurobiology. She examines some of the key cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive this dynamic process, and the possible role of neurotrophic factors. Lambe, Goldman-Rakic and Aghajanian examine the effects of serotonin on different regions of pyramidal dendrites within the laminate structure of the prefrontal cortex. They find evidence for layer-specific and compartment-specific effects on synaptic transmission, and discuss these finding in terms of dendritic architecture and the regulation of thalamo-cortical neurotransmission.\r\n\r\nCellular and molecular studies have shown that certain key aspects of neurodevelopment can be altered by abnormal intrinsic or extrinsic influences. It was only a few decades ago that Purpura and his colleagues provided the first evidence of dendritic abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome. Kaufmann and Moser provide an update on the increasing number of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with abnormal patterns of dendritic development or synaptic structure. Their paper highlights the remarkable progress we have made in identifying molecular defects and developing useful animal models. In a related paper, Kaufmann, MacDonald and Altamura report on structural proteins that regulate dendritic structure. They suggest that altered expression of cytoskeletal components may be a key to understanding the progressive pathology of certain developmental disorders, and cite improved molecular and histological techniques for evaluating these components in brain tissue.\r\n\r\nA variety of innovative strategies are being used to understand how neurodevelopmental disorders alter synaptic function. Three papers in this volume discuss models for specific neurological disorders and potential cellular and subcellular mechanisms. Jenner, Galaburda and Sherman show how studies of aberrant cell migration (ectopias) may provide insight into the functional abnormalities associated with dyslexia. They report on mouse strains that have a high incidence of cortical ectopias, which resemble those seen in post-mortem studies of some individuals with dyslexia. The ectopias result in anomalous subcortical connections, which may have implications for understanding processing abnormalities associated with dyslexia. Benes, Taylor and Cunningham present a model for schizophrenia based on abnormal interactions between incoming dopamine fibers and GABAergic neurons in the limbic system. They discuss evidence from post-mortem studies of brains from patients with schizophrenia as well as experimental research in rodent models. Walkley, Zervas and Wiseman provide evidence for abnormal dendritic structure and ectopic sprouting associated with certain ganglioside storage disorders (e.g. Tay\x96Sachs, Sandhoff and Niemann\x96Pick disease). This has led them to more basic studies on protein trafficking to understand the role of GM2 gangliosides in dendritogenesis and in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.\r\n\r\nToday we are in a better position to understand how mutant genes or altered gene expression can subtly affect early neurodevelopment and the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. One disorder that has particular relevance for dendritic mechanisms, is fragile-X syndrome. Although this is the leading heritable cause of mental retardation, the affected gene, FMR1, has only recently been identified and characterized. Irwin, Galvez and Greenough review studies on the synthesis and accumulation of the fragile-X mental retardation (FMR) protein in nerve terminals and provide evidence that it is driven by neuronal activity. This provides a potential mechanism for linking activity to the maintenance of synaptic structure, and provides a basis for understanding the behavioral and cognitive defects associated with fragile-X syndrome. Understanding of fragile-X syndrome has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of FMR-1 knockout mice, which have dendritic abnormalities similar to those seen in the human condition but more subtle cognitive and behavioral deficits. Braun and Segal have cultured hippocampal neurons from FMR-deficient mice in order to examine the cellular and molecular basis of these abnormalities. They find that even in dissociated cultures, the neurons display alterations in dendritic morphology and synaptic connectivity. They discuss these findings in the context of the functional abnormalities associated with FMR knockout mice.\r\n\r\nAs the papers in volume demonstrate, dendritic mechanisms provide the basis for fine-tuning the developing nervous system, adapting to early environmental interactions, and modifying function through learning and memory. The interdependence of neurodevelopmental events and early activity helps define \x91critical periods\x92 during child development and unique opportunities for educational and behavioral enrichment. Within the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, alterations in dendritic mechanisms provide the key to understanding the resulting cognitive, behavioral and social deficits. The next few decades offer special opportunities for neurobiological and behavioral researchers to strengthen the link between alterations in the brain substrate and the functional consequences, and to develop more effective therapeutic and support strategies.'",1
"b'Host cell invasion by Toxoplasma gondii is a multistep process with one of the first steps being the apical release of micronemal proteins that interact with host receptors. We demonstrate here that micronemal protein 1 (MIC1) is a lactose-binding lectin. MIC1 and MIC4 were recovered in the lactose-eluted (Lac+) fraction on affinity chromatography on immobilized lactose of the soluble antigen fraction from tachyzoites of the virulent RH strain. MIC1 and MIC4 were both identified by N-terminal microsequencing. MIC4 was also identified by sequencing cDNA clones isolated from an expression library following screening with mouse polyclonal anti-60/70 kDa (Lac+ proteins) serum. This antiserum localized the Lac+ proteins on the apical region of T. gondii tachyzoites by confocal microscopy. The Lac+ fraction induced hemagglutination (mainly type A human erythrocytes), which was inhibited by \xdf-galactosides (3 mM lactose and 12 mM galactose) but not by up to 100 mM melibiose ({alpha}-galactoside), fucose, mannose, or glucose or 0.2 mg/ml heparin. The lectin activity of the Lac+ preparation was attributed to MIC1, because blotted MIC1, but not native MIC4, bound human erythrocyte type A and fetuin. The copurification of MIC1 and MIC4 may have been due to their association, as reported by others. These data suggest that MIC1 may act through its lectin activity during T. gondii infection.'",2
"b""Background The association between tobacco smoking and oesophageal cancer is well established. However, some major questions remain unanswered such as the importance of kind of tobacco and smoke inhalation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of each kind of tobacco on the risk of squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus in men and to test whether the effect of kind of tobacco is similar whatever the sub-site of cancer. Tobacco consumption was assessed by the number of years of consumption and time since quitting.\r\n\r\nMethods We conducted a multicentre case-control study in three university hospitals in France (Caen, Dijon, and Toulouse). From 1991 to 1994, 208 cases and 399 controls, all male, were selected. During the interview, the subject's entire tobacco history was recalled, noting each type of tobacco consumed throughout life.\r\n\r\nResults Strong tobacco, dark tobacco and non-filter-tipped cigarettes were associated with an increase in risk whatever the adjustments, whilst light, filter-tipped cigarettes and mild tobacco were not. Hand-rolled cigarettes were more strongly associated with risk than manufactured cigarettes. The effect of hand-rolled cigarettes appeared stronger for the lower third whilst those of strong cigarettes and dark tobacco appeared stronger for the upper third of the oesophagus. The effect of inhaling was confined to the upper third.\r\n\r\nConclusions Our results, emphasizing the role of dark tobacco, hand-rolled cigarettes, strong cigarettes and non-filter-tipped cigarettes are in line with previous publications. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism underlying the tobacco effect could be different according to the sub-site of cancer.""",3
"b'Synchronous neuronal activity with millisecond precision has been postulated to contribute to the process of visual perceptual grouping. We have performed multineuron recordings in striate cortex of two alert macaque monkeys to determine if the occurrence and properties of this form of activity are consistent with the minimal requirements of this theory. We find that neuronal synchronization with millisecond precision is a prevalent and robust feature of stimulus-evoked activity in striate cortex. It occurs among adjacent cells recorded by the same electrode (<120 \xb5m), among cells recorded at separate but nearby sites (300\x96400 \xb5m) and between cells recorded at locations separated by 3\x964 mm. The magnitude and probability of synchronous firing is inversely related to the spatial separation between the cells and it occurs within and between groups of cells that are both tuned and untuned for stimulus orientation and direction. Among those tuned for orientation, cell pairs separated by <400 \xb5m showed no clear dependence of correlated firing on orientation preference. The occurrence of gamma-band (20\x9670 Hz) oscillations in the cellular firing patterns was a strong predictor of synchronous firing at each of the spatial scales. Nearly 90% of the cell pairs showing significant correlation also showed oscillatory firing in one or both cells of the pair. These results are consistent with some, but not all, of the previous reports of synchronous activity in striate cortex of both cat and primates. The similarities in the properties of synchronous oscillations in the monkey and cat suggest that this form of neuronal activity is a general property of mammalian striate cortex. The relation between correlation and oscillation suggests that neuronal rhythmicity is an important mechanism contributing to synchronization.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Factors responsible for the predictable generation of Th1 or Th2 immune responses to micro-organisms in vivo are not well characterized, although the ability of antigen presenting cells (APC) to provide co-stimulation, the kinetics of MHC\x96peptide ligand generation as well as the cytokine environment are all considered important factors for the differential Th1/Th2 priming of T cells. Our earlier findings of an IFN-{gamma}-dominant, Th1-type response to live Salmonella typhimurium (Stm) and a Th2-type response to killed Stm suggested that persistence of viable bacteria might be an important factor in the generation of IFN-{gamma}-dominant responses. Using genetically susceptible and resistant strains of mice to limit bacterial replication and persistence in vivo, we show that mice of the Ityr genotype, capable of a 10-fold better clearance of Stm, mount an IFN-{gamma}-dominant immune response following immunization with live Stm similar to that in the Itys strain. Further, metabolically defective mutants of Stm, aroA and purA, when used in the live form, also elicit IFN-{gamma}-dominant immune responses similar to the wild-type Stm strain despite their inability to proliferate in vivo. While a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli, which is antigenically cross-reactive but non-invasive, elicits hardly any IFN-{gamma} in immune responses, an invasive strain of E. coli induces an IFN-{gamma}-dominant response. These data together indicate that, while entry of bacteria into macrophages is likely to be critical for the generation of IFN-{gamma}-dominant immune responses, their persistence is not.'",4
"b""Antibody class switching is regulated by transcription of unrearranged CH genes to produce germline (GL) transcripts which direct the choice of isotype and are required for switching. However, their role is unknown. GL transcripts are initiated at the I exons located upstream of each switch region. Although deletion of the I exon by gene targeting prevents switch recombination to that CH gene, the I{alpha} exon can be replaced by an entirely different DNA segment, a minigene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter and encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), oriented in the sense direction, without reducing antibody class switching to IgA. To understand why HPRT substitution of the I{alpha} exon does not disrupt switch recombination, we have analyzed the structure of the transcript from the targeted allele in these mice. We identify a spliced transcript in which the HPRT exons are spliced to the C{alpha} gene segments, resulting in a structure similar to normal GL transcripts. The abundance of this transcript is similar to that of the normal {alpha} GL RNA. We also demonstrate that switching to the four IgG subclasses in B cells from these mice is reduced in comparison to wild-type mice. We discuss the possibility that the strong PGK promoter inserted at the Ig {alpha} locus may interfere with interaction of the promoters for {gamma} GL transcripts with the 3' IgH enhancer.""",4
"b'A phenotypic analysis of the lympho-hemopoietic cells which occur in the liver of 13-day-old fetal rats was achieved by flow cytometry in an attempt to further characterize the rat lymphoid progenitor cells.

On the contrary, the CD45\x96 cells were a heterogeneous cell subset which expressed Thy-1, CD71 and CD44 at distinct levels. After MACS separation, the CD45+ r13FL cells, but not the CD45\x96 cell subset, in vitro repopulated 14-day-old SCID mouse fetal thymic lobes providing rat T cells, both TCR{alpha}\xdf and TCR{gamma}{delta}, NK cells, and thymic dendritic cells but not B lymphocytes.

These results are discussed from the double perspective of the nature of the precursor cells which colonize the fetal thymus and the relevance of the xenogeneic SCID mouse fetal thymic microenvironment for supporting rat lymphopoiesis.'",4
"b""Previous studies have shown that several different neurotrophic factors can prevent death of cortical and hippocampal neurons induced by excitotoxic and oxidative insults in cell culture and in vivo. Because neuronal degeneration may be initiated by alterations occurring in synaptic compartments in disorders ranging from Alzheimer's disease to stroke, we tested the hypothesis that neurotrophic factors can exert direct protective actions at the level of the synapse. We now report that a nine amino acid bioactive fragment of activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF-9) enhances basal glucose and glutamate transport, and attenuates oxidative impairment of glucose and glutamate transport induced by amyloid \xdf-peptide and Fe2+, in neocortical synaptosomes. Preservation of transporter function required only short-term (1\x962 h) pretreatments. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was also effective in suppressing oxidative impairment of synaptic transporter functions, while nerve growth factor (NGF) was less effective. Additional analyses showed that ADNF-9, bFGF and NGF suppress oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by amyloid \xdf-peptide and Fe2+ in synaptosomes. Our data suggest that ADNF-9 can act locally in synaptic compartments to suppress oxidative stress and preserve function of glucose and glutamate transporters. Such synapto-protective actions suggest roles for activity-dependent trophic signaling in preventing degeneration of neuronal circuits, and indicate possible therapeutic applications of agents that stimulate local synaptic (transcription-independent) neurotrophic factor signaling pathways.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b""Sir\x97Scherb et al.1 reported results of a statistical analysis on still birth proportions in three European regions for the years 1980\x961992 and explore whether the decreasing time trend in these proportions was distorted during or after the Chernobyl accident.\r\n\r\nI have serious reservations about the scientific validity of the paper.\r\n\r\nFirst, both the introduction and the discussion include much material that is not pertinent to the investigation that leads to a confused discussion. The major objective of the authors was to verify their hypothesis that the radiation exposure in Germany due to the Chernobyl accident led to an increase in stillbirth proportion. Using data from other \x91Western\x92 or \x91Central\x92 (for the very specific definition of \x91Western\x92 and \x91Central\x92 see Scherb et al.) European countries their hypothesis could not be confirmed. Additionally, in Table 7 \x91results' and \x91conclusions' are listed that do not emerge from the analysis but are cited from former published and unpublished works of the authors.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are limitations in the statistical analysis:\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the 18 countries was based on geographic aspects. As can be seen from the values given in the legend of Figure 1Go and even better in Table 1Go of a paper by Dolk et al.2 the radiation exposure levels vary substantially within the countries combined in each group. This classification is not a valid one based on radiation exposure after the Chernobyl accident. The group \x91East\x92 especially is questionable as countries with very different stillbirth proportions and different levels of radiation exposure are combined. \r\nTo avoid the difficulties caused by the classification and as national proportions were available, national proportions could have been used in an ungrouped form. At least they should have been plotted or presented for visual inspection. Such an analysis may also give a better appreciation of the relation between the stillbirth proportions and radiation exposure. \r\nA result in Table 7 that is commented on, whether sex-ratio changed after the radiation exposure, is only mentioned in a short paragraph without data and without specific analysis. More importantly, it is stated that the classification used in the remainder of the paper was changed. For a statistical analysis this raises suspicions about its validity and leads to the impression that the change in the classification was used to obtain significant results. \r\nModelling the time trend should have been done in a uniform way for all three groups. As the analysis of the time trend is not of primary interest to the investigation (and could be considered as a confounder), it would be more logical to use the same time-trend model for all regions and to investigate the size and the significance of the added dummy variable(s). \r\nIn addition to the statistical analysis being questionable some details are not clear. Inspection of Figure 2Go (and Table 6) shows a clear decrease with a small curvage for \x91Central\x92 and \x91West\x92. There is no elevation in 1986 or 1987. The observation of the authors presented in previous papers that stillbirth proportion was increased in Germany in 1986 was not confirmed in this larger data set. Results for \x91West\x92 even show a significant decrease in 1987 and subsequent years, yet this group included countries (such as the northern part of the UK) where radiation exposure was higher than in Germany (see also Table 1Go in Dolk et al.2). Figure 2Go gives the impression that the decrease was accelerated slightly after 1986.\r\nFor \x91East\x92 the change of trend in 1986 is obvious. However, grouping countries is particularly questionable, as they are so disparate and as radiation exposure after Chernobyl varied widely within and between the grouped regions. Interestingly, as mentioned by the authors, data from the more contaminated Belarus and Ukraine do not confirm the observation of an elevation or change in trend during or after 1986.\r\nThe authors emphasize that causal inference can be drawn from this \x91ecological' study, yet the discussion in Table 7 is centred around the \x91radiation hypothesis'. Additionally, only parts of what is listed as \x91results' in the table are presented in the paper. For example:\r\n\r\nThe strong and significant deviation towards lower proportions from the decreasing trend in 1986 and 1987 in the region \x91West\x92 is neither mentioned nor commented on. This group includes some countries with a relatively high exposure (such as the northern UK). \r\nBelarus and Ukraine show no increase during or after 1986. These results do not fit the authors a priori hypothesis. It is incomprehensible that the authors specifically argue at this point about the general limitations in the data and the instability in the populations. The same argument holds for all results in similar ecological investigations and for other results in the paper. \r\nThat perinatal death proportions do not show a clear increase in eastern countries is attributed to the instability in the perinatal data. No details of this analysis are given. The scientific validity of this is questionable as stated earlier. \r\nIt is concluded from differences between perinatal death and stillbirth in \x91East\x92 (again, no details are presented in the paper), that \x91radioactivity induces less neonatal deaths than stillbirth.\x92 This is contradictory to the authors' statement that no causal conclusions can be drawn from the data and it does not take into account the results from the other regions. \r\nAn analysis of the highly aggregated data can neither prove nor disprove an effect between radiation exposure and stillbirth rates, especially in view of an exposure that is far below background radiation in most of the countries (maximum 0.7 mSv, most regions below 0.3\x960.03 mSv, see Table 1Go in Dolk et al.2) and that areas with very different exposures are combined for this ecological analysis. The authors state in the Abstract that \x91Our results ... contradict the present radiobiological knowledge\x92. Based on the data presented, I am unable to accept this conclusion.""",3
"b'The T cell co-stimulatory receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 appear to have opposite effects on T cell activation, mediating augmentation and inhibition of T cell responses respectively. Since these two receptors use the same ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), the co-ordinate timing of CD28 and CTLA-4 expression has a major impact on the regulation of immune responses. While the kinetics of co-stimulatory molecules have been established for T cell stimulation in vitro, little is known about CD28 and CTLA-4 expression in response to T cell activation in vivo. In this study we have investigated the kinetics of CD28 and CTLA-4 expression upon CD4+ T cell activation in response to soluble peptide in vivo. Using mice transgenic for a T cell receptor specific for the I-Au-restricted N-terminal peptide of myelin basic protein MBP Ac1\x969, we show maximal up-regulation of both CD28 and CTLA-4 2 days after peptide administration. CTLA-4 expression correlated positively with early activation markers on the same cells and was high on blast cells. Administration of peptide analogs with higher affinity for I-Au MHC class II revealed a higher increase in CTLA-4 than in CD28 expression in response to improved TCR ligation. Further, a small population of CD4+ T cells expressing CTLA-4, CD25 and CD45RBlow was identified in mice that had not been treated with specific peptide. The implications of these observations for immune regulation are discussed.'",4
"b'The mature cerebral cortex is divided into morphologically distinct, functionally dedicated and stereotypically connected cortical areas. How might such functional domains arise during development? To investigate possible intrinsic programs within the embryonic cerebral cortex we examined patterns of gene expression early in corticogenesis. We performed these studies using the developing macaque monkey because of the size, complexity, areal make-up and the extended nature of its cortical development. Here, we present results for two types of molecules. (i) Transcription factors \x96 gene products that bind DNA and activate transcription, directing cellular fates through cascades of gene expression. We find that the transcription factors TBr-1, Lhx-2, Emx-1 and a novel POU domain-containing gene are differentially expressed within the forming primate forebrain, and are present in gradients across the neocortex. (ii) The EphA receptor tyrosine kinases \x96 gene products that mediate cellular recognition in many embryonic systems. Individual members of this family are expressed during primate corticogenesis in pronounced gradients and/or well-defined compartments with distinct boundaries. Together, these results suggest that at least two modes of grouping cells within the neocortex exist: the graded patterning of cells across its full anteroposterior extent and the parcellation of cells into defined domains. Moreover, emergence of molecular differences between regions of the cortical plate, prior to the arrival of afferent and formation of efferent connections, suggests that the initial cellular parcellation in the telencephalon is cell-autonomously regulated. This initial independence from peripheral influences supports the existence of an intrinsic protomap that may function both to differentially attract and respond to specific afferents, thus predicting the functional map of the mature cortex.'",1
"b""Background In order to monitor the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), integrated national programmes of unlinked anonymous (blinded) HIV sero-surveys have taken place in the UK since 1990.\r\n\r\nMethods The programmes comprise multi-centre surveys primarily using specimens gathered routinely for screening groups of patients. All specimens are irreversibly unlinked from patient identifiers before being tested.\r\n\r\nResults The surveys have met their prime aim of providing at low cost minimally biased estimates of current HIV prevalence and trends in sentinel populations. The surveys have remained acceptable to professionals and the public, being successfully implemented without breech of their founding principles. The findings have had major public health applications, have influenced HIV policy and funding, been used for monitoring the spread of HIV, for targeting and evaluating health promotion and improving projections of severe HIV disease. The surveys have detected substantial prevalence rises and under-diagnosis of HIV which would otherwise have been unrecognised. The programmes' value is being increased by sub-typing HIV-1 isolates, capturing additional demographic information to detect spread among minority groups. The same specimens are used for monitoring other infections (initially hepatitis A, B and C).\r\n\r\nConclusions Monitoring HIV and other infections through unlinked anonymous HIV surveillance has become an integral essential part of national HIV and AIDS surveillance. Although it has unique applications the value of unlinked anonymous surveillance is maximized when used in conjunction with behavioural data, information from HIV and AIDS reporting, and behavioural data and surveillance for other sexually transmitted infection""",3
"b""The aim of this study was to determine neuropsychological performance in apparently cognitively, mentally, and physically healthy abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects compared with control subjects who were recruited for a number of different neuroimaging studies. Methods: All subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests as part of the neuroimaging protocol. Results: The group dependent on alcohol performed as well as controls on a non-verbal memory test and verbal fluency but performed worse in the verbal memory task, Trail A + B, and total IQ derived from Silverstein's short-form of the WAIS-R. However, the IQ performance of both groups was above average. In both groups, age was associated with slower performance on the Trail A + B task. In the alcohol-dependent group, severity of dependence and length of abstinence was not associated with performance of any task. Conclusions: In this apparently clinically healthy population of abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects, frontal lobe dysfunction was detectable using the Trail A + B and digit symbol tasks. This was despite above-average WAIS-R IQ scores. Consideration needs to be given to routine incorporation of cognitive testing in alcohol dependence since subtle deficits may not be easily apparent and may impact on treatment outcome.\r\n\r\n""",0
"b'It has been proposed that proteins modified by ethanol metabolites, such as acetaldehyde (AcH) or {alpha}-hydroxyethyl radicals (HER) may be an important step in the aetiology of alcoholic liver disease. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that these modified proteins may act as a marker of ethanol intake. In this study, we have measured the generation of various types of modified proteins in the liver and blood of ethanol-fed rats. Multiple types of protein modification were observed in the livers of the ethanol-fed rats. In each case, the level of modification increased over the first 6 weeks of ethanol feeding, but reached a plateau by 10 weeks. In contrast to the liver, elevated levels of proteins modified by malondialdehyde were not seen in the plasma of ethanol-fed animals, whereas elevated levels of modification due to AcH and HER were observed. In haemolysates from these animals, only modification due to AcH was seen. Further investigation of the modification of plasma proteins showed that albumin, a protein produced in the liver, carried all the types of modification investigated, whereas immunoglobulin G, a protein derived from an extra-hepatic source, only carried modifications due to acetaldehyde. This study demonstrates for the first time that modification of plasma proteins by ethanol metabolites can occur at both intra- and extra-hepatic sites.'",0
"b'Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs [immunostimulatory sequences (ISS)] have been described as potent adjuvants of type 1 immune responses when co-administered with protein or peptide vaccines. To investigate their role in the immune response to polysaccharides (CHO), different preparations of anti-Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine were administered to mice. The unconjugated CHO did not induce the synthesis of specific antibodies even in the presence of ISS. On the other hand, anti-CHO-specific antibodies significantly increased in the presence of ISS, when tetanus (TT) or diphtheria [cross-reacting material (CRM)] toxoid-conjugated CHO were used to immunize mice. The adjuvant effect was also observed for the immune response against the carrier protein (TT and CRM). ISS insured an early and long-lasting specific IgG production. The effects of ISS on the anti-CHO immune response could be attributed to the amplification of the T help provided by the carrier. The analysis of anti-CHO IgG subclasses showed a significant increase of IgG2a and IgG3 in the presence of ISS. ISS caused a rapid release of IL-12 and IFN-{gamma} in sera from treated mice. This data provide a first evidence for the ability of ISS to induce an anti-CHO type 1-like immune response and demonstrate that ISS have the potential to increase host antibody response against both the CHO and the protein component of a conjugated vaccine.'",4
"b'IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in NK cell activation and Th1 response. IL-18 has a structural homology to IL-1, particularly IL-1\xdf. IL-18R, composed of IL-1R-related protein (IL-18R{alpha}) and IL-1R accessory protein-like (IL-18R\xdf), belongs to the IL-1R family. Furthermore, IL-18R at least partly shares the signal transducing system with IL-1R. Thus, the IL-18\x96IL-18R system has a striking similarity to the IL-1\x96IL-1R system. For this reason, we regarded it important to investigate whether, like IL-18, IL-1\xdf synergizes with IL-12 in inducing IFN-{gamma} production from human T cells and plays an important role in the Th1 response. Here we show that IL-12 and IL-1\xdf synergistically induce T cells to proliferate and produce IFN-{gamma} without their TCR engagement. IL-12 stimulation induced an increase in the proportion of T cells positive for IL-18R. Then, IL-12-stimulated T cells responded to IL-18 or IL-1\xdf by their proliferation and IFN-{gamma} production, although levels of IL-1\xdf-induced responses were lower. CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, although they constitutively expressed IL-18R\xdf mRNA, did not express IL-18R{alpha} mRNA. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation alone induced IL-18R{alpha} mRNA without affecting the expression of IL-18R\xdf mRNA. Th1-inducing conditions (PHA, IL-12 and anti-IL-4) further increased this expression. We also show that Th1 cells but not Th2 cells have increased expression of IL-18R and IL-1R, and produce IFN-{gamma} in response to IL-18 and/or IL-1\xdf.'",4
"b'Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between operant oral ethanol self-administration and intravenous (i.v.) cocaine self-administration in male Wistar rats. Methods: Twenty-four rats were trained to lever press for 8% v/v ethanol in the sucrose-fading procedure. The subjects with the highest (high ethanol responders [HER], n = 7) and lowest (low ethanol responders [LER], n = 7) ethanol intakes were selected for further experiments. After a wash-out period, during which i.v. catheters were implanted, the HER and LER were trained to nose-poke for cocaine infusions (0.33 mg/kg/infusion, a FR1 schedule) for nine daily sessions. Results: The HER emitted more \x91active\x92 nose-pokes and obtained more cocaine infusions during sessions 2\x964. Drug-seeking behaviour in the absence of cocaine reinforcement was then assessed for three consecutive extinction sessions. No between-group differences were found in terms of extinction of cocaine seeking. Locomotor responses to a novel environment were also similar in both groups. Conclusions: The present results suggest that a propensity to self-administer ethanol predicts more rapid acquisition of cocaine self-administration behaviour but does not influence subsequent behaviour during extinction.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'{alpha}3-fucosyltransferases ({alpha}3-FucTs) catalyze the final step in the synthesis of a range of important glycoconjugates that function in cell adhesion and lymphocyte recirculation. Six members of this family of enzymes have been cloned from the human genome, and their expression pattern has been shown to be highly regulated. Each enzyme has a unique acceptor substrate binding pattern, and each generates a unique range of fucosylated products. Results from a range of studies have provided information on amino acids in the FucT sequence that contribute to the differential acceptor specificity for the FucTs, and to the binding of the nucleotide sugar donor GDP-fucose. These results, in conjunction with results obtained from the analysis of the disulfide bond pattern, have provided useful clues about the spatial distribution of amino acids that influence or directly contribute to substrate binding. This information is reviewed here, and a molecular fold prediction is presented which has been constructed based on the available information and current modeling methodology.'",2
"b""One of the least explored and least understood regions of the primate cerebral cortex is the orbitofrontal cortex, a part of the frontal lobe that lies on the roof of the orbit. Classic clinical evidence suggests that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in critical human functions, such as social adjustment and the control of mood, drive and responsibility, traits that are crucial in defining the \x91personality\x92 of an individual. Phineas Gage is a paradigmatic patient, who, after suffering major destruction of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortices in both hemispheres, was portrayed as no longer being himself. In recent years, diverse functional studies have identified activations in the orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that this prefrontal field is a component of brain systems critically engaged in memory, reward and decision-making mechanisms. These functions may well be considered as basic components of higher emotional and social behavior presumably involving this part of the cortex. The mounting evidence that the orbitofrontal cortex holds many clues to the ways in which complex behaviors are regulated prompted one of us (W.S.) to organize, during the June 1998 Forum of European Neuroscience held in Berlin, a symposium entitled \x91The Mysterious Orbitofrontal Cortex\x92. The high interest shown in the symposium argued the opportunity of collecting the most recent research devoted to unravelling the structure, function and dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex, in both humans and non-human primates.\r\n\r\nThis special issue presents a multidisciplinary account of research efforts focusing on the primate orbitofrontal cortex. The comparative study by D. \xd6ng\xfcr and J.L. Price places the orbital and medial prefrontal fields in the perspective of mammalian evolution on the basis of their connections in rodents and primates. In the human brain, \xd6ng\xfcr and Price highlight recent imaging and neuropathological observations supporting the involvement of medial and orbital prefrontal regions in mood disorders. Orbitofrontal cortex affectation in Alzheimer's disease is treated by G.W. Van Hoesen and his colleagues, who describe neurofibrillary tangles populating it with specific areal and laminar distributions. They suggest that this pathology can contribute to several behavioral abnormalities that accompany the disease. Still on structural grounds, C. Cavada and her colleagues provide a comprehensive account of the connections of the orbitofrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. A common underlying notion in these reports is the parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex into distinct territories, which exhibit specific architecture, connections and neuropathology. This parcellation may well correspond to functional differences in situations in which decisions are made by estimating the values of different outcomes from incomplete information, as revealed in the human imaging studies of R. Elliott and colleagues.\r\n\r\nFour articles explore orbitofrontal functions in non-human primates: A.C. Roberts and J.D. Wallis describe deficits in inhibitory control functions during multidimensional discrimination following orbitofrontal lesions, while the reports by K. Hikosaka and M. Watanabe, by W. Schultz and his colleagues, and by E.T. Rolls tackle different aspects of the processing of reward information by orbitofrontal neurons in behaving monkeys. Taken together, these studies elucidate the involvement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex in emotional control and reward mechanisms, functions that are further assessed by A. Bechara and colleagues in humans suffering from brain lesions. These authors conceive the orbitofrontal cortex as part of a large-scale system that mediates decision-making in a process that also requires the participation of emotion and cognition.\r\n\r\nThe last three reports focus on the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex in addiction. N.D. Volkow and J.S. Fowler describe how the human orbitofrontal cortex may be involved in compulsive aspects of drug addiction lying beyond the simple reward mechanisms usually invoked for this behavior. The issues involved in animal models of drug addiction are presented in the paper by L.J. Porrino and D. Lyons. E.D. London and colleagues emphasize the relationship between orbitofrontal activations in humans and personality disturbances associated with substance abuse, drug expectancy, craving and decision-making.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the work compiled in this special issue shows the orbitofrontal cortex to be a multifaceted cortical territory that has links to widespread brain structures and is critically involved in both complex primate behavior as well as human mental and neurological disease. The data and the paths for future research outlined here lead us to conclude that the orbitofrontal cortex should no longer be considered a genuine \x91mystery\x92 because it can and should be further scrutinized using the tools available to modern neuroscience.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'A chimeric protein containing the catalytic domain of Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase, the transmembrane domain of the major envelope glycoprotein of the baculovirus (gp67), and the signal peptide of ecdysteroid glucosyltransferase of the baculovirus was expressed under the control of the very late promoter p10 in baculovirus-infected lepidopteran cells. The recombinant protein was found to be enzymatically active. Three days after infection, equal amounts of activity were found associated to the plasma membrane and in the infection medium, both forms having the same apparent molecular weight and being N-glycosylated. When exogenous galactosylated acceptors (lactose or asialo-{alpha}1-acid glycoprotein) were added in the culture medium of cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus in the presence of a sialylated donor, a sialylation could be observed. Therefore, we propose the use of trans-sialidase as a potential tool for sialylation of glycoconjugates in the baculovirus\x96insect cells system.'",2
"b'T cells require a TCR and a co-stimulatory signal for activation. We have examined the effect of the strength of TCR and co-stimulatory signals on proliferation and production of cytokines by differentiated T cell clones. The TCR signal was varied using antigen dose and altered peptide ligands. The co-stimulatory signal was varied by using as antigen-presenting cells, Chinese hamster ovary cell transfectants that express different levels of the B7-1 molecule with similar levels of MHC class II. Our results show that the level of co-stimulation has a profound effect on the response to an antigen, and that a strong co-stimulatory signal can convert a weak agonist into a full agonist and an agonist into a superagonist. Antigenicity is not absolute but a function of the strengths of the TCR and co-stimulatory signals. Increasing the strength of co-stimulation can lower antigen concentration required for maximal proliferative responses by T cell clones by 5 log. These results show that the level of expression of co-stimulatory molecules will profoundly regulate T cell clonal expansion and effector functions.'",4
"b'Proper growth and branching of dendrites are crucial for nervous system function; patterns of dendritic arborization determine the nature and amount of innervation that a neuron receives and specific dendritic membrane properties define its computational capabilities. Until recently, there was relatively little known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dendritic growth, perhaps because dendrites were historically considered to be intrinsically determined, passive elements in the formation of connections in the nervous system. In the last few years, however, overwhelming evidence has accumulated indicating that dendritic growth is remarkably dynamic and responsive to environmental signals, including guidance molecules and levels and patterns of activity. This manuscript reviews our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dendritic growth, the influence of activity in sculpting specific patterns of dendritic arbors, and a potential integral role for dendrites in activity-dependent development of circuits in the nervous system.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'The adaptor molecule LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is a palmitoylated integral membrane protein that localizes to the glycolipid-enriched microdomains in the plasma membrane. Upon TCR engagement, LAT becomes phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues and then binds several critical signaling molecules. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a LAT-deficient cell line. Using this cell line, we demonstrate that LAT is required for TCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-{gamma}1, Vav and SLP-76. LAT is also required for Erk activation, CD69 up-regulation, and AP- and NFAT-mediated gene transcription. We also demonstrate, by reconstituting this cell line with LAT mutants, that the LAT transmembrane domain and palmitoylation at Cys26, but not Cys29, are required for LAT function and TCR signaling. These studies provide further evidence for the crucial role of the LAT molecule, and demonstrate the use of a LAT-deficient cell line for the analysis of LAT structure and function.'",4
"b'Background So far, no randomized controlled trials with a mean mammographic screening interval of >=2 years has demonstrated statistically significant mortality reduction for women younger than age 50. The issue of screening frequency is vital in detection of primary breast cancer.\r\n\r\nMethods The study group consisted of cancers diagnosed in women who participated in a serial screening programme with a mean screening interval of 2 years. To study the effectiveness of the screening, a comparison is made between the distribution of age at which the tumour could be detected when biennial mammographic screening is the only detection method, and the distribution of age at which the tumour would be detected by either biennial mammographic screening or the development of symptoms. Some recently developed statistic methods, such as bootstrap, the maximum likelihood distribution estimator for doubly censored data and the EM algorithm, are used in estimation of these distributions.\r\n\r\nResults The hypothesis tests and confidence intervals show that the difference between the two distributions was statistically significant for women younger than 50 and 50\x9670 years old, but not for women over 70 years.\r\n\r\nConclusions The statistical analysis indicates that for women younger than 50, and 50\x9670 years of age, a screening mammogram every other year is not frequent enough to detect primary breast cancer, but for women over 70 years, it might be sufficient.'",3
"b""The study of human remains from archaeological contexts can potentially provide archaeologists with a window on how populations lived and died, what they may have eaten, whether they practised hunting and gathering or agriculture, how they coped with illness, whether they traded and if they were in conflict. However, inherent in the study of the past is its fragmentary nature, the biased samples that \x91represent\x92 the past, and the problems of interpretation of the remains.\r\n\r\nPalaeoepidemiological study faces all these limiting factors and more. Importantly, for instance, the plague does not affect the bones of the skeleton and therefore cannot be identified skeletally \x97only through biomolecular analysis can Yersinia pestis DNA be identified.1 Considering the mortality profile of a known plague cemetery population,2 however, can aid in assessing the impact of the plague on populations if biases not associated with the presence of the plague such as over-representation of males, females, or specific ages at death, are not present in the population.\r\n\r\nWaldron asserts that the plague struck populations indiscriminately and therefore one might expect to see a \x91true\x92 representation of the once living population represented by the mortality profile. Conversely, a population not suffering from the impact of the plague would show a different mortality profile. The difference, however, will only occur if the context (i.e. socioeconomic and environmental) from which the non-plague cemetery derives is different to that of the plague cemetery.\r\n\r\nTo construct a mortality profile one firstly needs to determine the age and sex of each skeleton. This can be a difficult task. The sex of non-adult skeletons cannot be determined without biomolecular analysis,3 and adult skeletons are problematic to age because of different rates of ageing within and between the sexes.4 Research has shown that there is a tendency to underage older adults and overage younger adults,4 whilst older female skeletons appear masculine and younger male skeletons look feminine.5 Clearly, if skeletons are placed in the wrong age, sex (or both) categories, the resulting mortality profile will be flawed. Waldron's comment that the absence of young males in the 15\x9624-year-old age category may be explained by the very fact that young males may be misclassified as female.6\r\n\r\nWaldron's reallocation of unaged or unsexed skeletons is equally problematic. Firstly, these skeletons should be reallocated proportionately, i.e. according to the known proportion of individuals in each age group, not equally between all adult age groups, since the resulting percentage totals for each group will be altered and the premise that adults of any age have an equal probability of dying is not a biologically valid assumption. Secondly, taphonomic research has shown that not all human skeletons preserve equally. For example, the bones of non-adults are smaller in size and more fragile, and the bones of older adults may have antemortem bone loss.7 These factors can lead to a biased mortality profile. As Waldron stated in his excellent book (p.11), \x91Bias is always inevitable in palaeoepidemiological populations ... for a variety of reasons, the most obvious of which is that we have no control over their selection because of ... intrinsic and extrinsic factors\x92.8 Controlling the biases is more difficult than actually coming to terms with the fact that they exist.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the evidence presented, there appears to be little difference between mortality profiles for the plague and the overlying mediaeval cemetery. Thus, the evidence presented is that plague cemeteries are not a more reliable indicator of a living population. However, the use of control groups for comparative purposes in palaeoepidemiology must be undertaken with caution. A control group has well known and understood attributes (variables) and can be used as a \x91known\x92 sample. Perhaps the plague cemetery group, in this case, is the control group (not the group to be tested), i.e. it is known to be one through inference from historical data.\r\n\r\nRecent work2 that considered the palaeodemography of catastrophic (14th century London plague and 19th century cholera) and attritional (later Mediaeval) cemeteries in later Mediaeval England also found no differences in the probability of dying, life expectancy and survivorship between the populations, or between the sexes. Work has also corroborated that death distributions from catastrophic events resemble the living population because these events strike with limited regard for age.9 As compelling as these studies are, the study of human skeletal remains as a means towards understanding a once living population must be undertaken. Waldron shows the potential and problems of looking at burials from a plague context and using them as as a model for the living population.\r\n""",3
"b'Although complement activation appears to have an important role both in the early and late phases of atherosclerosis, the exact mechanism of the initiation of this activation is still unknown. Since injuries of the endothelial cells are known to result in increased stress-protein expression we tested the complement-activating ability of recombinant human 60 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp60). Human hsp60 was found to activate the complement system in normal human serum in a dose-dependent manner. Activation took place through the classical pathway. The lack of complement activation in agammaglobulinemic serum indicates that the classical pathway is triggered by anti-hsp60 antibodies. Hsp60 activated complement in the sera of 74 patients with coronary heart disease as well, and a strong positive correlation (r = 0.459, P < 0.0001) was found between the extent of complement activation and the level of anti-hsp60 IgG antibodies but there was no correlation to the level of anti-hsp65 IgG antibodies. Further distinction between anti-hsp60 and anti-hsp65 antibodies was obtained from competitive ELISA experiments: binding of anti-hsp60 antibodies to hsp60-coated plates was inhibited only by recombinant hsp60 and vice versa. Our present findings indicate that anti-hsp60 and anti-hsp65 antibodies are distinct, showing only partial cross-reactivity. Since complement activation plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and the levels of complement-activating anti-hsp60 antibodies are elevated in atherosclerosis-related diseases, our present findings may have important pathological implications.'",4
"b""The representations of the surfaces of the hand in the primary somatosensory cortical field, area 3b, were reconstructed in detail in seven owl monkeys and two squirrel monkeys trained to pick up food pellets from five wells of different sizes. From an early clumsy performance in which several to many retrieval attempts were required for each successful pellet retrieval, the monkeys exhibited a gradual improvement in digital dexterity as shown by significant decreases in mean numbers of grasp attempts/successful retrieval and corresponding standard deviations (e.g. 5.8 \xb1 4.5 and 4.8 \xb1 3.1 respectively, for the smallest well) between the first and last training sessions. All monkeys commonly used alternative, specific retrieval strategies involving various combinations of digits for significant time epochs before developing a highly successful strategy, which, once achieved, was rapidly stereotyped. For example, the numbers of digit combinations used during the first five versus the last five training sessions decreased from 3.3 \xb1 0.7 to 1.8 \xb1 0.6 for the smallest well. In both owl and squirrel monkeys, as the behavior came to be stereotyped, monkeys reliably engaged limited surfaces of the glabrous tips of two digits (in eight monkeys), or of three digits (in one monkey) in the palpation and manipulation of these small pellets for their location, capture, and transportation to the mouth. In cortical area 3b, the magnification of representation of these differentially engaged glabrous fingertip surfaces was nearly 2x larger than for the corresponding surfaces of other hand digits, or for the contralateral cortical representations of the same digit surfaces on the opposite hand. In parallel, cutaneous receptive field for area 3b neurons representing crucial digital tip surfaces were less than half as large as were those representing the corresponding surfaces of control digits. Receptive field overlaps were smaller on the trained fingertips than on control fingers. Moreover, the proportion of small overlaps was greater for the trained digits (76 \xb1 7%) than for the other digits of the same hand (49 \xb1 5.4%). There was still a simple, single \x96 but apparently topologically expanded \x96 representation of these differentially engaged skin surfaces in these monkeys. Thus, with very limited manual exercise over a total period of a few hours of practice at a skill played out in brief daily sessions over a several week long training period, the representations of skin surfaces providing information crucial for successfully performing a small-object retrieval behavior appeared to be substantially remodeled in the most `primary' of the SI somatosensory cortical fields, cortical area 3b. By that remodeling, behaviorally important skin surfaces were represented in a much finer representational grain than normal.

"b'Interpreting observational epidemiological evidence can involve both the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative criteria-based method of causal inference. The relationships between these two methods are examined in terms of the capacity of meta-analysis to contribute to causal claims, with special emphasis on the most commonly used causal criteria: consistency, strength of association, dose-response, and plausibility. Although meta-analysis alone is not sufficient for making causal claims, it can provide a reproducible weighted average of the estimate of effect that seems better than the rules-of-thumb (e.g. majority rules and all-or-none) often used to assess consistency. A finding of statistical heterogeneity, however, need not preclude a conclusion of consistency (e.g. consistently greater than 1.0). For the criteria of strength of association and dose-response, meta-analysis provides more precise estimates, but the causal relevance of these estimates remains a matter of judgement. Finally, meta-analysis may be used to summarize evidence from biological, clinical, and social levels of knowledge, but combining evidence across levels is beyond its current capacity. Meta-analysis has a real but limited role in causal inference, adding to an understanding of some causal criteria. Meta-analysis may also point to sources of confounding or bias in its assessment of heterogeneity.'",3
"b'Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins associated with microtubules (MAPs) modulate the functional properties of microtubules (MT). A study was designed to test the hypothesis that ethanol at pharmacologically relevant levels affects phosphorylation of MAPs. Low (6, 12, 24, and 48 mM) and high (96, 384, and 768 mM) levels of ethanol were used in the study. MT prepared from rat brain by successive cycles of assembly\x96disassembly were found to contain two high molecular weight proteins (MAP2 and MAP1), tubulin, and 70-kDa neurofilament. The kinase activity was determined using [{gamma}32P]ATP as a phosphate donor. The results showed that ethanol primarily stimulated MAP2 phosphorylation. Low levels of ethanol stimulated, whereas high levels decreased, the kinase activity. MAP1 was phosphorylated to a lesser extent. 70-kDa neurofilament and tubulin were phosphorylated, however, the dose-dependent biphasic effect of ethanol on phosphorylation was not found in these cytoskeleton proteins. To determine whether the ethanol-induced kinase activity was cAMP-dependent, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was isolated, purified, and kinase activity was determined with and without ethanol. The results showed that cAMP was not involved in ethanol-induced kinase activity. We conclude that ethanol predominantly stimulates phosphorylation of MAP2 in a dose-dependent manner.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Two different metallothionein promoter\x96mouse CD14 fusion genes were constructed. The membrane form of the CD14 fusion gene, designated M14M, contained the full-length CD14 cDNA sequence, whereas the soluble form of the fusion gene, designated M14S, was truncated to lack the sequence for the phosphatidylinositol-anchoring site. Expression of transgenic RNA in M14M and M14S mice on the basal diet was abundant in the liver. After maintenance with water containing ZnSO4 (50 mM) for 4 days, expression of transgenic RNA in M14M and M14S mice was strong in the small intestine. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated CD14 expression in these organs in M14S and M14M mice. Levels of CD14 in sera from M14S mice after zinc administration were significantly higher than these animals maintained with normal water, M14M mice after zinc administration and non-transgenic mice. Sera from M14S and M14M mice after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide LPS (LPS) demonstrated significantly lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} and IL-6 than those from non-transgenic mice. Lethality in endotoxin shock produced by i.p. injection of 30\x9640 \xb5g/g body wt LPS was not different between M14S, M14M and non-transgenic mice. However, survival rates in the lethal Shwartzman reaction induced by priming and challenge injections of LPS were significantly higher in M14M and M14S mice than in non-transgenic mice.'",4
"b'The short in vivo lifespan of many cytokines can make measurement of in vivo cytokine production difficult. A method was developed to measure in vivo IL-4 and IFN-{gamma} production that eliminates this problem. Mice are injected with a biotin-labeled neutralizing IgG anti-IL-4 or anti-IFN-{gamma} mAb and bled 2\x9624 h later. Secreted cytokine is captured by the biotin-labeled mAb to produce a complex that has a relatively long in vivo half-life and consequently accumulates in serum. Serum concentrations of the complex are determined by ELISA, using wells coated with an antibody to a second epitope on the same cytokine to capture the complex. This technique is specific and increases sensitivity of detection of secreted IL-4 at least 1000-fold. The amount of cytokine measured is directly proportional to the amount produced and relatively independent of the site of cytokine production. Furthermore, because mice are injected with small quantities of biotin-labeled anti-cytokine mAb, which sample, rather than neutralize, all secreted cytokines, cytokine-dependent responses are not inhibited. The in vivo half-lives of the cytokine\x96anti-cytokine mAb complexes are sufficiently short to allow cytokine production to be measured every 2\x963 days in the same mice. Thus, use of this assay provides a practical and relatively simple and inexpensive way to measure ongoing in vivo cytokine production. Furthermore, the techniques that have been developed to measure in vivo production of IL-4 and IFN-{gamma} can be applied to in vivo measurement of other molecules that have a short in vivo lifespan, including other cytokines.'",4
"b'We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of sertraline in recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients with current depressive symptoms. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of sertraline at achieving stable abstinence, at ameliorating depressive symptoms and at improving quality of life in these patients. Methods: The study included 83 patients, who received either sertraline (50\x96150 mg/day) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome criteria were the rate of relapse into alcohol consumption and the rate of response on the Montgomery and \xc5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results: At the end of the treatment period, relapse rates were 23.1% in the placebo group and 31.8% in the sertraline group. Responder rates for depression were 38.5% for the placebo group and 44.2% for the sertraline group. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with either variable. However, when patients were stratified into severe (MADRS score >=26) and moderate (MADRS score <26) depression at inclusion, a significant treatment benefit with sertraline was observed in the former group. Quality of life, determined by the SF-36, improved in both groups, with more benefit observed for the sertraline group on mental health items. Sertraline was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the two treatment groups. Conclusions: The explanation for the overall good outcome in both treatment groups and for the inability to demonstrate a clear treatment effect may reside in the clinical features of the patients included.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Although T cell clone monospecificity is ensured by several allelic exclusion processes operating at either the genotypic or phenotypic levels, clones expressing two distinct {alpha}\xdf or {gamma}{delta} TCR have been described in several instances. Thus far, the origin of dual TCR-expressing cells and the homeostatic mechanisms controlling the size of this subset in the periphery remain poorly understood. In the course of a phenotypic analysis of {gamma}{delta} T cells in HIV-infected patients, we detected the presence of a T cell subset stained by both V{delta}2- and V{delta}3-specific mAb, which represented a large fraction (up to 16.5%) of {gamma}{delta} peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in one HIV patient. The presence of two distinct functional {delta} chains on these cells was confirmed by phenotypic and molecular analysis of TCR transcripts expressed by V{delta}2+V{delta}3+ T cell clones derived from this patient. For 18 months, the absolute number of these cells varied similarly to the other PBL subsets, before becoming undetectable in blood samples. Moreover, most of these cells expressed CD8 receptors, which are classically found on activated, but not resting, {gamma}{delta} T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that dual TCR-expressing T cells are subjected to peripheral expansions and contractions presumably following antigen recognition, which would argue against a systematic counter-selection of these cells during peripheral antigen-driven responses.'",4
"b'The mouse chromosome 6 locus Cmv1 controls resistance to infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). We have previously shown that Cmv1 is tightly linked to members of the NK gene complex (NKC) including the Ly49 gene family. To assess the candidacy of individual NKC members for the resistance locus, first we followed the co-segregation of Cd94, Nkg2d, and the well-characterized Ly49a, Ly49c and Ly49g genes with respect to Cmv1 in pre-existing panels of intraspecific backcross mice. Gene order and intergene distances (in cM) were: centromere\x96Cd94/Nkg2d\x96(0.05)\x96Ly49a/Ly49c/Ly49g/Cmv1\x96(0.3)\x96Prp/Kap/D6Mit13/111/219. This result excludes Cd94 and Nkg2d as candidates whereas it localizes the Ly49 genes within the minimal genetic interval for Cmv1. Second, we monitored the cell surface expression of individual Ly49 receptors in MCMV-infected mice over 2 weeks. The proportion of Ly49C+ and Ly49C/I+ cells decreased, the proportion of Ly49A+ and Ly49G2+ remained constant, and the cell surface density of Ly49G2 increased during infection, suggesting that NK cell subsets might have different roles in the regulation of MCMV infection. Third, we performed in vivo antibody depletion of specific NK cell subsets. Depletion with single antibodies did not affect the resistant phenotype suggesting that Ly49A+, Ly49C+, Ly49G2+ and Ly49C/I+ populations are not substantial players in MCMV resistance, and arguing for exclusion of the respective genes as candidates for Cmv1. In contrast, mice depleted with combined antibodies showed an intermediate phenotype. Whether residual NK cells, post-depletion, belong to a particular subset expressing another Ly49 receptor, or a molecule encoded by a yet to be identified gene of the NKC, is discussed.'",4
"b'Some earlier studies have suggested that platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B activity should be determined at time points other than early in the abstinence phase. However, the optimal times for blood sampling have not been precisely defined. We therefore assessed platelet MAO-B activity repeatedly in 13 male alcohol-dependent patients over the 2 months after the end of a period of heavy alcohol intake. Twelve healthy men were used as controls. In the alcohol-dependent patients, platelet MAO-B activity was transiently increased from 2 to 6 weeks after the end of alcohol intake and the values during this time period were not different from those of controls. Platelet MAO-B activity was, however, significantly lower in the alcohol-dependent patients at 1 week and at 2 months after the end of alcohol intake, in comparison to controls. It is concluded that the transient increase in platelet MAO-B activity after the end of alcohol intake in alcohol-dependent patients may conceal a difference from a control group. Therefore, it is suggested that when platelet MAO-B activity is determined, the preferential time point for obtaining those values in alcohol-dependent patients is after 2 months of abstinence.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'We have generated a panel of cross-reactive T cells by immunizing SJL mice (I-As) with Q144 peptide, an analog of an autoantigenic peptide (W144) of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) 139\x96151 (HSLGKWLGHPDKF) in which W was replaced by Q at position 144. Following immunization with Q144, T cells were expanded in vitro with W144, which is a cross-reactive, suboptimal ligand, for Q144-specific T cells. The T cell clones responded to both ligands and grew normally on the peptide W144, but were hyperstimulated when activated by Q144 in vitro. This hyperstimulation results in a heteroclitic proliferative response with secretion of additional cytokines not induced by W144. Thus expansion of T cells by a suboptimal cross-reactive ligand effectively lowers the activation threshold so that the immunizing antigen becomes a hyperstimulating ligand for the clones. Surprisingly, when the T cell clones are grown on the hyperstimulating ligand Q144, some adapt by increasing their activation threshold. This desensitization results in a loss of response to a number of cross-reactive ligands and the appearance of a more specific T cell response. Long-term culture with the hyperstimulating ligand is sometimes associated with down-regulation of CD4 expression. These results provide an explanation for the common finding of T cell heteroclicity, and suggest that although the specificity and hierarchy of the response of T cells to peptides is determined by the TCR, activation threshold and effector functions are modified by exposure to cross-reactive ligands. This observation has implications for the development and regulation of autoimmune disease.'",4
"b'The possible relationship between postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function, as assessed by growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine (CLON; 1.5 or 2.0 \xb5g/kg i.v.), and psychopathology was investigated in 30 patients with alcohol-dependence in the early withdrawal period. Excluding patients with high baseline GH, 23 of the 26 patients had blunted GH responses to CLON and 57% moderate or severe depression at day 1 after the end of alcohol intake. After 1 week, the GH responses to CLON remained blunted in 20 of 21 retested patients, whereas the depression and anxiety remitted in all but two patients. The results do not support any relationship between postsynaptic {alpha}2-adrenoceptor function and symptoms of psychopathology in alcohol withdrawal.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'In this report the significance of virus-induced non-specific T cell activation was re-evaluated using transgenic mice in which about half of the CD8+ T cells expressed a TCR specific for amino acids 33\x9641 of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein I. This allowed tracing of cells with known specificity and priming history in an environment also containing a normal heterogeneous CD8+ population which served as an intrinsic control. Three parameters of T cell activation were analyzed: cell cycle progression, phenotypic conversion and cytolytic activity. Following injection of the IFN inducer poly(I:C), proliferation of memory (CD44hi) CD8+ T cells but no phenotypic or functional activation was observed. Following injection of an unrelated virus [vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)], naive TCR transgenic cells did not become significantly activated with respect to any of the parameters investigated. In contrast, memory TCR transgenic cells were found to proliferate extensively early after VSV infection (day 0\x963), whereas limited proliferation was observed later (day 3\x966) when proliferation of non-transgenic CD8+ T cells is maximal. This aborted response did not result from anergy to TCR stimulation, as memory TCR transgenic cells proliferated vigorously upon stimulation with their nominal peptide. Despite the massive proliferation of memory cells observed early after VSV infection, no phenotypic or functional activation was observed. Together these findings indicate that both non-specific and antigen-specific signals contribute to the initial virus-induced proliferation of CD8+ T cells, but for further proliferation and differentiation to take place, TCR\x96ligand interaction is required. The implications for maintenance of T cell memory is discussed.'",4
"b""Certainly let us share Zielhuis and Kiemeney's exasperation1 at the proliferation of disciplinary branches. There is no merit in devising particular insular subdisciplines; the world out there after all is what we are trying to explain, and the world comes with no guarantee that it respects (or even notices) these boundaries. (These boundaries fluctuate by language, as Mielck and Bloomfield2 report.) The task is to understand the genesis and maintenance of illness and disease, using whatever tools best work, with some hope (and perhaps indeed constraint) that such understanding maps routes to intervention.\r\n\r\nHowever, that task surely entails some hesitations over Zielhuis and Kiemeney's substantive belief: \x91that shopping in neighbouring scientific fields, without thorough subject-matter knowledge, will lead to statistical results without relevant meaning.' Of course if I wish to assess the impact of early social factors upon subsequent health (an important social policy issue) I need to know that it is medically plausible that the development of the human fetus may be affected by maternal nutrition, medically implausible that astrological influences are active. It may even help me to be aware that there is some evidence suggesting that babies born small through deprivation in the womb may become \x91biologically thrifty\x92 and if environmental circumstances improve, and there is more food about, biologically thrifty individuals may be more prone than others to the adverse consequences of obesity. These assumptions structure the variables and models considered, and (as in the \x91thrift\x92 case) may lead to evaluation of interactions which \x91common sense\x92 might have ignored. But this is very far from thorough subject matter knowledge. Allow me now the supposition that maternal glucocorticoids can reprogram the fetal hormone system, that transmission is prevented by the placental enzyme 11\xdf-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (11b-HSD), add to this the observation that disadvantaged rats (small and suffering from high blood pressure) can be shown to have sluggish 11b-HSD activity ... so suggesting a possible theory for fetal \x91memory\x92. Zielhuis and Kiemeney would presumably have it that: \x91All epidemiological hypotheses are ... derived from such theories by deductive reasoning\x92. But surely this is nonsense. Of course resolution of the mechanism is important, and could have real consequences\x97knowing it we might, for example, be able more cheaply to intervene in the consequential than in the generative mechanisms of malnutrition (and this might have implications for developing, as well as developed, economies). Admittedly, not having \x91thorough subject matter knowledge\x92 I have no idea whether the 11b-HSD hypothesis is even in the right ball-park. But\x97and this is what matters for the present dispute\x97resolution of the mechanism at this level is not a prior condition of avoiding nonsense and writing sense on the social policy question with which I started.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to write nonsense about social processes (glance at the collection that passes for \x91sociology\x92 in any university bookshop). It is sadly\x97still\x97disconcertingly easy to generate nonsenses through the uncritical application of now well-documented multivariate procedures. To educate out of these nonsenses is sufficient skill for an academic lifetime. To expect thorough medical knowledge as well is implausible and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOf course there are apparent counterexamples. A classic tale is Stott's study3 in 1958 showing that, in the terminology of the time, mothers of mongol children reported that they had more shocks during pregnancy than had mothers with normal children. He concluded that socioeconomic factors generating such shocks were important. Some (now elementary) knowledge of chromosomal abnormalities readily shows Stott to be mistaken. Stott is to be faulted not because he did not have the requisite (though then limited) medical knowledge, but because his social science was bad social science. He should have realized that mothers confronted by a \x91bad\x92 outcome would have constructed retrospective narratives to explain to themselves the event.\r\n\r\nSo we need good social research, and we need cautious data analysis, and these are not simply other routes to laboratory medical knowledge. Indeed at times the apparent state of knowledge can mislead. Take a study of depression, whose findings are by now canonized in the secondary literature as truths. Brown and Harris,4 having carefully ascertained that severe events were associated with depression, went on to explore the possibility of an intervening variable which acted between events and depression, to protect some women. For their \x91vulnerability\x92 variable they present apparently persuasive evidence (Table 1Go) of its effect: we are shown that of those low on vulnerability who experience a severe event 10% became depressed; for the medium group 21% became depressed; the highly vulnerable attain a striking 79% figure for the onset of depression following a severe event. The authors (who do indeed have thorough subject-matter knowledge) treat this as support for a well established cognitive theory of depression, and tie \x91vulnerability\x92, as an intervening variable, to the absence of \x91self-esteem\x92. Here a ready match to what was presumed known led to over-interpretation of the findings. Inspection of the panels of the Table shows that the odds ratios underlying these disparate percentages are very similar. Indeed the full Table (of Events by Depression by Vulnerability by Joblessness) can, be fitted (P = 0.17) by a log-linear model with no three-way interaction terms (using a first-letter shorthand, the model is: [ED][VD] [VE][JD]). The fitted values from this two-way model are very close to the figures Brown and Harris read as evidence for interaction. So the data are fully compatible with a much simpler model of cumulative additive effects, with no interaction, and a fortiori no vulnerability tied to self-esteem\x97despite the study having entered the secondary literature as demonstrating the salience of self-esteem.\r\nThe point is that it is difficult to be alert and sceptical when analysing data. Expectations can lead researchers too readily to accept, and present as ineluctable, a particular model when the data fit their presuppositions, without enquiring whether alternate narratives are equally compatible.5 It is also difficult to intelligently analyse social behaviour and deploy appropriate concepts. (Indeed, though this is a tale for another day, one could query the labelling of the observed construct as \x91vulnerability\x92, and also wonder why Brown and Harris moved from using the measurable term \x91self confidence\x92, the women's esteem own vocabulary, to the unmeasurable \x91self-esteem\x92.) Perhaps because of the relative development of the two subtending disciplines, it is easier to talk nonsense about \x91class\x92 than about \x91nutrition\x92. Sociological concepts are not, at present, very well defined; to avoid nonsense about \x91class\x92 requires considerable sociological knowledge. Which is why I see room for well-trained, intelligent, quantitative sociologists to contribute to epidemiological discussion. Some medical literacy would be an advantage, but the case for requiring \x91a thorough training in ... biomedicine\x92 is unproven.\r\nWe should support Zielhuis and Kiemeney's campaign to get rid of the term \x91social epidemiology\x92, but from a precisely contrary motive. Let us encourage each other to go \x91shopping in ... neighbouring scientific fields\x92. That is, after all, how many advances in science were made. To say that is not to say that all that passes for social epidemiology makes sense (on this see Lynch et al.6). Nor that it can answer all problems (and our perception of those which it can profitably address will fluctuate as our knowledge expands\x97as we know which of our posited mechanisms, social or medical, are favoured by the world-out-there). But to say \x91No way\x92 is to pretend to more ignorance than we collectively possess.""",3
"b'Within the medial temporal lobe, both the hippocampus and amygdala are frequently targeted by researchers and clinicians for volumetric analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, different data acquisition techniques, analysis software and anatomical boundaries have in the past made it difficult to compare results of MRI studies from different laboratories. In order to reduce these differences, a segmentation protocol was established with 40 healthy normal control subjects recently scanned in our laboratory. Data acquisition was performed with a three-dimensional gradient echo technique, and scans were corrected for non-uniformity and registered into standard stereotaxic space prior to segmentation. Volumetric analysis was performed manually using three-dimensional software that allows simultaneous analysis of sagittal, coronal and horizontal images. Intra- and inter-rater coefficients yielded correlation coefficients comparable with other protocols. The hippocampal volume was larger in the right hemisphere (3324 versus 3208 mm3), while no interhemispheric differences for the amygdala (1154 versus 1160 mm3) could be observed. Most importantly, results from recent segmentation protocols for hippocampus and amygdala seem to approach each other with regard to mean volumes and interhemispheric differences. This indicates that the advances in scanning technique, volume preparation and segmentation protocols allow a more precise definition of medial temporal lobe structures with MRI, and that results for mean volumes for hippocampus and amygdala from different laboratories will eventually become comparable.'",1
"b""Neurological findings suggest that the human striate cortex (V1) is an indispensable component of a neural substratum subserving static achromatic form perception in its own right and not simply as a central distributor of retinally derived information to extrastriate visual areas. This view is further supported by physiological evidence in primates that the finest-grained conjoined representation of spatial detail and retinotopic localization that underlies phenomenal visual experience for local brightness discriminations is selectively represented at cortical levels by the activity of certain neurons in V1. However, at first glance, support for these ideas would appear to be undermined by incontrovertible neurological evidence (visual hemineglect and the simultanagnosias) and recent psychophysical results on `crowding' that confirm that activation of neurons in V1 may, at times, be insufficient to generate a percept. Moreover, a recent proposal suggests that neural correlates of visual awareness must project directly to those in executive space, thus automatically excluding V1 from a related perceptual space because V1 lacks such direct projections. Both sets of concerns are, however, resolved within the context of adaptive resonance theories. Recursive loops, linking the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) through successive cortical visual areas to the temporal lobe by means of a series of ascending and descending pathways, provide a neuronal substratum at each level within a modular framework for mutually consistent descriptions of sensory data. At steady state, such networks obviate the necessity that neural correlates of visual experience project directly to those in executive space because a neural phenomenal perceptual space subserving form vision is continuously updated by information from an object recognition space equivalent to that destined to reach executive space. Within this framework, activity in V1 may engender percepts that accompany figure\x96ground segregations only when dynamic incongruities are resolved both within and between ascending and descending streams. Synchronous neuronal activity on a short timescale within and across cortical areas, proposed and sometimes observed as perceptual correlates, may also serve as a marker that a steady state has been achieved, which, in turn, may be a requirement for the longer time constants that accompany the emergence and stability of perceptual states compared to the faster dynamics of adapting networks and the still faster dynamics of individual action potentials. Finally, the same consensus of neuronal activity across ascending and descending pathways linking multiple cortical areas that in anatomic sequence subserve phenomenal visual experiences and object recognition may underlie the normal unity of conscious experience.""",1
"b'The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of alcohol on androgen levels among premenopausal women. Eighty-seven women in the mid-cycle phase of the menstrual cycle, 47 of whom used oral contraceptives (OC+), were included in the study. The range for reported alcohol consumption was 0\x964 drinks/day. The total testosterone levels were significantly higher after alcohol intake (0.5 g/kg) than after placebo at 45 min and 90 min from the start of drinking among both OC\x96 and OC+ subjects. This effect was also seen in the free testosterone fraction. The effect on testosterone was more prominent among OC+ subjects. Androstenedione levels were significantly lowered and the testosterone:androstenedione ratio significantly elevated by alcohol among both OC\x96 and OC+ subjects. No effect of alcohol on dehydroepiandrosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels was observed. A positive correlation was observed between the change in testosterone levels and the change in androstenedione levels during placebo conditions. The correlation was significantly reduced during alcohol conditions among OC+ subjects, indicating an increased androstenedione to testosterone conversion. No significant dose (0.34, 0.68 and 1.02 g/kg) or time (45, 90 and 150 min) effects on total testosterone were observed in a substudy involving 10 OC+ subjects. The present results suggest that the testosterone effect is related to the zero-order mechanism of ethanol oxidation. The observed testosterone and androstenedione effects are suggested to be the result of an increased androstenedione to testosterone conversion in the liver caused by the alcohol-mediated elevation in the [NADH]:[NAD+] ratio. The present findings may be relevant in the development of hyperandrogenism and loss of female sexual characteristics associated with heavy alcohol consumption.'",0
"b'While Jun/Fos-containing transcription factors are known to be necessary for many TCR-mediated events in mature T cells, relatively little is known about their roles in thymocyte development. We have generated transgenic mice that express a trans-dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun (TAM-67) specifically in thymocytes. Expression of TAM-67 inhibited the up-regulation of AP-1-responsive genes such as c-jun and IL-2 in stimulated thymocytes from transgenic mice. In addition, altered thymocyte development in TAM-67-expressing mice was revealed by a decrease in thymic cellularity (~50%) which could be accounted for primarily by a reduction in the number of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, a large percentage of which retained CD25. The decrease in the number of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes did not appear to be due to an enhanced rate of apoptosis but rather to a decrease in the number of CD4\x96CD8\x96CD25\x96 cells in the S + G2/M stages of the cell cycle. These results indicate that Jun/Fos-containing transcription factors promote the proliferative burst that accompanies the transition from the CD4\x96CD8\x96 to the CD4+CD8+ stage of thymocyte development.'",4
"b""Background The Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) has collected cancer data for a sufficiently long period of time to capture essentially all prevalent cases of cancer, and to provide unbiased estimates of cancer prevalence. However, prevalence proportions estimated from Connecticut data may not be representative of the total US, particularly for racial/ethnic subgroups. The purpose of this study is to apply the modelling approach developed by Capocaccia and De Angelis to cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute to obtain more representative US site-specific cancer prevalence proportion estimates for white and black patients.\r\n\r\nMethods Incidence and relative survival were modelled and used to obtain estimated completeness indices of SEER prevalence proportions for all cancer sites combined, stomach, cervix uteri, skin melanomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, lung and bronchus, colon/rectum, female breast, and prostate. For validation purposes, modelled completeness indices were computed for Connecticut and compared with empirical completeness indices (the ratio of Connecticut based prevalence proportion estimates using 1973\x961993 data to 1940\x961993 data). The SEER-based modelled completeness indices were used to adjust SEER prevalence proportion estimates for white and black patients.\r\n\r\nResults Model validation showed that the adjusted SEER cancer prevalence proportions provided reasonably unbiased prevalence proportion estimates in general, although more complex modelling of the completeness indices is necessary for female cancers of the colon, melanoma, breast, cervix, and all cancers combined. The SEER-based cancer prevalence proportions are incomplete for most cancer sites, more so for women, whites, and at older ages. For all cancers combined, prevalence proportions tended to be higher for whites than blacks. For the site-specific cancers this was true for stomach, prostate, cervix uteri, and lung and bronchus (men only). For colon/rectal cancers the prevalence proportions were higher for blacks through ages 59 (men) and 64 (women), and then for the remaining ages they were higher for whites. Prevalence proportions were lowest for stomach cancer and highest for prostate and female breast cancers. Men experienced higher prevalence proportions than women for skin melanomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, lung and bronchus, and colon/rectal cancers.\r\n\r\nConclusion The modelling approach applied to SEER data generally provided reasonable estimates of cancer prevalence. These estimates are useful because they are more representative of cancer prevalence than previously obtained and reported in the US.""",3
"b'B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated cell death has been proposed as a mechanism for purging the immune repertoire of anti-self specificities during B cell differentiation in bone marrow. Mitochondrial alterations and activation of caspases are required for certain aspects of apoptotic cell death, but how the mitochondria and caspases contribute to BCR-mediated cell death is not well understood. In the present study, we used the mouse WEHI-231 B cell line to demonstrate that mitochondrial alterations and activation of caspases are indeed participants in BCR-mediated cell death. The peptide inhibitor of caspases, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), blocked cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and various manifestation of nuclear apoptosis such as nuclear fragmentation, hypodiploidy and DNA fragmentation, indicating that signals from the BCR induced the activation of caspases. In addition, z-VAD-fmk delayed apoptosis-associated changes in cellular reduction\x96oxidation potentials as determined by hypergeneration of superoxide anion, as well as exposure of phosphatidylserine residues in the outer plasma membrane. By contrast, although z-VAD-fmk retarded cytolysis, it was incapable of preventing disruption of the plasma membrane even under the same condition in which it completely blocked nuclear apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane potential loss was also not blocked by z-VAD-fmk. Bongkrekic acid, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, suppressed not only the mitochondrial membrane potential but also the change of plasma membrane permeability. Overexpression of Bcl-xL prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, nuclear apoptosis and membrane permeability cell death triggered by BCR signal transduction. These observations indicate that death signals from BCR may first cause mitochondrial alterations followed by activation of both necrotic and apoptotic cascades.'",4
"b'Addition of the weak base ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or the proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 to cultured HeLa and LS 174T cells effectively neutralized the pH gradient of the secretory pathway. This resulted in relocalization of the three studied glycosyltransferases, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, \xdf1,2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, and \xdf1,4 galactosyltransferase 1, normally localized to the Golgi stack, the medial/trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi/TGN, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation of the tagged or native glycosyltransferases showed that NH4Cl caused a relocalization of the enzymes mainly to vesicles of endosomal type, whereas bafilomycin A1 gave mainly cell surface staining. The general morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus was retained as judged from immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies. When the O-glycans on the guanidinium chloride insoluble gel-forming mucins from the LS 174T cells were analyzed by gas chromatography\x96mass spectrometry after neutralization of the secretory pathway pH by NH4Cl over 10 days shorter O-glycans were observed. However, no decrease in the number of oligosaccharide chains was indicated. Together, the results suggest that pH is a contributing factor for proper steady-state distribution of glycosyltransferases over the Golgi apparatus and that altered pH may cause alterations in glycosylation possibly due to a relocalization of glycosyltransferases.'",2
"b'Background In a series of surveys intended for current and former smokers but sent to a random sample of the general population, we asked never smokers and smokers who did not wish to participate to transmit the questionnaire to any ever smoker they knew. We compared participants who received the questionnaire directly from us (original participants) to participants who received it from an addressee (secondary participants).\r\n\r\nMethods Questionnaires on smoking were mailed to 3300 residents of Geneva (Switzerland) in 1997, and returned by 1167 people (35%).\r\n\r\nResults The final sample consisted of similar numbers of original participants (n = 578, primary response rate = 18% of total sample, or about 46% of ever smokers) and secondary participants (n = 566). Original participants were 1.7 years older than secondary participants (P = 0.03) and were more likely to be men (50% versus 43%, P = 0.009). Proportions of current smokers, stages of change, confidence in ability to quit smoking, cigarettes per day and attempts to quit smoking were similar in the two groups. Secondary participants had lower self-efficacy scores (\x960.30 standard deviation (SD) units, P <= 0.03), and they derived more pleasure from smoking (+0.25 SD units, P = 0.04). Among ex-smokers, direct participants were less active than secondary participants in coping with the temptation to smoke (\x960.58 SD units, P = 0.002). Associations between smoking-related variables were similar in original and secondary participants.\r\n\r\nConclusion Allowing non-eligible addressees to transmit the questionnaire to someone else doubled the response rate, produced moderate bias on some variables only and had no detectable impact on associations between smoking-related variables.'",3
"b'This experiment tested the effects of cortical spreading depression (CSD) on the ventromedial hypothalamic activity and on the related thermogenesis, both stimulated by an injection of neostigmine in the hippocampus. The firing rate of the neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the temperature of the interscapular brown adipose tissue and of the colon (TIBAT and TC) were monitored in 24 urethane-anesthetized male Sprague\x96Dawley rats divided into four groups. These variables were measured before and after hippocampal injection of neostigmine (5 x 10\x967 mol) in the first and second groups or of saline in the third and fourth groups. The hippocampal injection was preceded by CSD in the first and third groups, while CSD was not induced in the second and fourth groups. The same procedure was carried out in the other four groups of six rats each and oxygen consumption was monitored. The results show an increase in the firing rate, TIBAT, TC and oxygen consumption after the neostigmine injection. CSD significantly reduces these enhancements. The findings demonstrate that: (i) the activation of ventromedial hypothalamic neurons are involved in the thermogenic changes due to the effects of a neostigmine injection into the hippocampus; and (ii) integrity of cerebral cortex is required for this activation of thermogenesis.'",1
"b'The pattern of somatic mutations of shark and frog Ig is distinct from somatic hypermutation of Ig in mammals in that there is a bias to mutate GC base pairs and a low frequency of mutations. Previous analysis of the new antigen receptor gene in nurse sharks (NAR), however, revealed no bias to mutate GC base pairs and the frequency of mutation was comparable to that of mammalian IgG. Here, we analyzed 1023 mutations in NAR and found no targeting of the mechanism to any particular nucleotide but did obtain strong evidence for a transition bias and for strand polarity. As seen for all species studied to date, the serine codon AGC/T in NAR was a mutational hotspot. The NAR mutational pattern is most similar to that of mammalian IgG and furthermore both are strikingly akin to mutations acquired during the neutral evolution of nuclear pseudogenes, suggesting that a similar mechanism is at work for both processes. In yeast, most spontaneous mutations are introduced by the translesion synthesis DNA polymerase {zeta} (REV3) and in various DNA repair-deficient backgrounds transitions were more often REV3-dependent than were transversions. Therefore, we propose a model of somatic hypermutation where DNA polymerase {zeta} is recruited to the Ig locus. An excess of DNA glycosylases in germinal center reactions may further enhance the mutation frequency by a REV3-dependent mutagenic process known as imbalanced base excision repair.'",4
"b'The daily fluid intake of male rats of the alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) lines with simultaneous access to 10% (v/v) ethanol and water was determined during a baseline period (2 weeks), following adrenalectomy (1 week), and for 2 weeks following corticosterone treatment. The results showed that adrenalectomized AA rats decreased their ethanol intake compared to the sham-operated AA controls and that treatment with corticosterone restored the intake of ethanol to that observed during the baseline period. In contrast to the AA rats, there were no alterations in ethanol intake after adrenalectomy and following corticosterone replacement in the ANA rats. These results suggest that corticosterone stimulates ethanol intake in animals with pronounced high preference for ethanol.'",0
"b'Alcohol dependence is a risk factor for suicide, and in the general population alcohol consumption and suicide rates are known to be associated. We investigated victims with and without alcohol misuse among unselected completed suicides to explore the role of alcohol misuse in the suicidal process and final act. In a total 1-year (1987\x961988) population of suicides in the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland, alcohol-misusing and -non-misusing victims were compared. On the basis of informant interviews, 35% (n = 349) of included victims were classified as alcohol misusers and 65% (n = 648) as non-misusers. The misusers were more often younger, male, divorced or separated and had more often worked, but were recently unemployed. They had experienced more often recent adverse life events possibly dependent on their own behaviour, were far more likely to be alcohol-intoxicated at the time of suicide, and tended to die from drug overdose. Several characteristics of these predominantly male alcohol misusers indicated better earlier lifetime psychosocial adjustment compared to the non-misusers, but more adverse life events close to suicide. Alcohol misuse is likely to have a deteriorating influence on the life course of those who eventually succumb to suicide, and its adverse consequences are common in misusers during the final months.'",0
"b'CMP-[beta]-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-neuNAc) is the substrate for the sialylation of glycoconjugates by sialyltransferases in microbes and higher eukaryotes. CMP-neuNAc synthetase catalyzes the formation of this substrate, CMP-neuNAc, from CTP and neuNAc. In this report we describe the purification of CMP-neuNAc synthetase from bovine anterior pituitary glands. The enzyme was purified by ion exchange, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography. The protein was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight of 52 kDa, a subunit size similar to that of the E.coli K1 (48.6 kDa). The identity of the 52 kDa protein band was confirmed by native gel electrophoresis in that the position of the enzyme activity in gel slices coincided with the position of major bands in the stained gel. Photoaffinity labeling with 125I-ASA-CDP ethanolamine resulted in the modification of a 52 kDa polypeptide that was partially protected against modification by the substrate CTP. Enzyme activity in crude fractions could be adsorbed onto an immunoadsorbent prepared from antibody against the purified 52 kDa protein. Taken together these data suggest that the 52 kDa polypeptide purified by this procedure described in this report is indeed CMP-neuNAc synthetase. The active enzyme chromatographed on a gel filtration column at 158 kDa suggesting it exists in its native form as an oligomer.'",2
"b""A paper in this issue of the IJE adds to the already long list of papers which show an association between small size at birth and cardiovascular risk in later life. Barker's idea of the \x91fetal origins\x921 has survived and strengthened through the last decade, albeit undergoing a degree of metamorphosis to include contributions from childhood growth.2\r\n\r\nThe multicentre study3 confirms the relationship of small size at birth with blood pressure in young children from three developing countries (China, Guatemala and Chile). There was no relationship of small birth size with blood pressure in Nigerian children, confirming some previous observations in African subjects. The body proportions at birth in these babies were different not only from those in the developed countries but also between themselves, implying different patterns of intrauterine growth. Unfortunately, the study did not include Indian babies which are the smallest in the world, have a characteristic body composition and will grow up to become part of the massive epidemic of diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) over the next few decades.4 In the Swedish children (control group from a developed country) there was a weak relation of blood pressure with \x91thinness\x92 at birth (low ponderal index). Thus, any disturbance of growth in utero: either throughout gestation (children from developing countries) or in the later stages (Sweden), occurring in malnourished as well as well nourished mothers, is associated with elevated blood pressure in later life. Aetiological factors in these different situations are likely to be different.\r\n\r\nThere are difficulties in performing Barker-type studies in developing countries but gradually data are emerging. A study in Mysore (India), showed that people who were born small (weight, length and head circumference) had higher prevalence of CHD (history of \x91angina\x92 and Q waves on resting electrocardiogram).5 These people were born to mothers who were \x91underweight\x92. On the other hand people who developed diabetes were short and fat at birth, and were born to \x91overweight\x92 mothers.6 The sampling strategy in this study was not ideal and the criteria for diagnosing CHD have not been validated in Indians. In Pune, we have shown that insulin resistance and other cardiovascular risk factors in childhood are related to low birthweight, especially if there is subsequent \x91catch up\x92.7 A study in Jamaican children8 showed a relationship between small size at birth and blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin concentration and serum cholesterol concentration, though the findings were not always reproduced in other studies of African children. A recent study in China showed that small size at birth increased the risk of insulin resistance syndrome in later life;9 low body mass index of the mother was an independent risk factor.\r\n\r\nIf maternal (under)nutrition is a major influence in fetal \x91programming\x92, it will have substantial public health implications, especially in the developing countries. The \x91original\x92 fetal origins concept relates to fetal undernutrition in an undernourished mother. Fetal overnutrition, for example in an infant of a diabetic mother also increases future risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, suggesting a U-shaped relationship between intrauterine growth and adult disease, first demonstrated in Pima Indians for diabetes.10 Public health interventions will need to keep this in mind.\r\n\r\nIn animals, dietary protein restriction in pregnancy predictably leads to higher blood pressure11 and reduced insulin secretion12 in the offspring. Human data is however inconsistent and somewhat confusing. Maternal starvation during the Dutch Hunger winter increased cardiovascular risk in the offspring13 but not during the siege of Leningrad.14 A number of recent publications relating maternal intake of carbohydrates, proteins and fats to fetal growth failed to show a consistent relationship.15,16 Most studies have reported only maternal macronutrient intake. In our recent study in six villages near Pune, frequency of maternal intake of foods rich in micronutrients (green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk) and circulating concentrations of micronutrients (folate and vitamin C) were strong determinants of neonatal size.17 Intake of calories, proteins and carbohydrates was not related. In studies from Aberdeen, higher intake of carbohydrates, proteins and fats during pregnancy has been associated with hypertension and diabetes in the offspring.18,19 These results point towards the complexity of the relationship between maternal nutrition and fetal programming. The effects of nutritional factors may vary depending on the position of the population in the epidemiological and nutritional transition. In addition, the genetic makeup of the population will modify the response to nutritional stimuli.\r\n\r\nFindings to date suggest there could be a multitude of mechanisms by which intrauterine environment could influence adult disease. There is little information on factors like intrauterine infections in relation to future cardiovascular risk. Rare mutations which affect glucose and insulin metabolism, cause diabetes and also affect fetal growth have been reported (glucokinase,20 insulin receptor21), as well as other more common predisposing genetic polymorphisms (INS-VNTR22, mitochrondrial DNA23,24 and angiotensin-converting enzyme25). We need to know more about gene-environment interaction (nutritional and non-nutritional) during the intrauterine period which may hold important answers to this novel mechanism of disease. Only then may we think about public health interventions for primordial prevention.""",3
"b'The nature and extent of callosal morphological alterations in schizophrenia remain unresolved. A parametric surface modeling approach using magnetic resonance (MR) images was employed. This provided spatially accurate representations of midsagittal callosal surfaces in schizophrenic patients (n = 25; 15 males) and normal controls (n = 28; 15 males). Areas of functionally relevant callosal channels and measures reflecting callosal shape were visualized and compared across groups. To register neuroanatomical landmarks surrounding the corpus callosum, each three-dimensional MR volume was scaled according to Talairach AC\x96PC distance, and raw distances included as covariates in multivariate analyses. Results revealed: (i) a marked vertical displacement of the corpus callosum in patients (P < 0.01); (ii) increases in curvature of superior and inferior callosal surfaces (P < 0.001); and (iii) significant increases in maximum widths in anterior and posterior regions in male patients compared to male controls; as well as (iv) increased patterns of callosal variability in female patients but no effects of diagnosis between female groups. These findings demonstrate a clear index of structural neuropathology in male schizophrenic patients. Displacement and curvature increases were highly correlated with structural differences in surrounding neuroanatomical regions, including increased volume of the lateral ventricles (P < 0.01).\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'Corticosterone acts within the brain to stimulate alcohol consumption in the rat. The experiments reported here were aimed at identifying where in the brain corticosterone acts to facilitate ethanol drinking. The daily fluid intake of male Wistar rats with simultaneous access to 6% ethanol and water was determined during a 1-week pre-operative baseline period and following implantation of corticosterone in various brain areas. Animals bearing unilateral or bilateral implants of corticosterone in the ventral striatum showed increased ethanol consumption compared to cholesterol-treated controls. Ethanol intake was not affected when corticosterone was implanted into septum, hippocampus, or thalamus. Neither were changes in fluid intake detected in animals bearing ventral striatal implants of two related steroid hormones, aldosterone and testosterone. These results indicate that corticosterone partly acts within the ventral striatopallidal system to facilitate alcohol consumption in the rat.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'The development of axonal connections between thalamic nuclei and their cortical target areas occurs in a highly specific manner. To explore the mechanisms of thalamocortical axon pathfinding, we investigated the expression of several members of the ephrin and Eph gene families in the forebrain. The Eph ligand ephrin-A5 was expressed in three distinct gradients during the development of the telencephalon. The first gradient occurred in the cortical ventricular zone and established ephrin-A5 as one of the earliest markers distinguishing cells residing in the anterior versus posterior cortical neuroepithelium. The second gradient was apparent in the subplate and occurred in spatial opposition to a distinct gradient for the low-affinity NGF receptor p75. This finding reveals that different regions of the early subplate are molecularly heterogeneous. Third, we confirmed that ephrin-A5 is expressed in a bi-directional gradient in the cortical plate, with highest levels in the somatomotor cortex. Three putative receptors for ephrin-A5 \x96 EphA3, EphA4 and EphA5 \x96 showed distinct expression patterns in the developing thalamus. The graded distributions of ephrin-A5 in the developing subplate and cortex and the expression of its receptors in the thalamus are consistent with the notion that the Eph ligands and their receptors may function in the topographic mapping of thalamic axons to specific cortical areas.'",1
"b'The precise signaling pathways to induce a germinal center (GC) phenotype and somatic mutations in human B cells are presently not understood. Major phenotypical hallmarks of a human GC B cell are up-regulated expression of CD10 and CD95 together with a heterogeneous expression of CD77. Activation of resting human tonsillar B cells using anti-CD40 and anti-IgM antibodies normally only induces up-regulation of CD38 and CD71 but has no effect on the typical GC markers. However, we show here that an additional co-ligation of the glycoprotein CD44 on such tonsillar B cells up-regulated the typical human GC markers CD10, CD38, CD77 and CD95, and down-regulated CD24 and CD39 as well as induced progression towards apoptosis in these cells; all characteristics of GC B cells. These data indicate a functional role of CD44 during activation of human naive B lymphocytes and in the generation of GC B cells.'",4
"b'IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{alpha} have been proven to play an important role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is well known that TNF-{alpha} induces IL-6 production from synovial cells as well as their proliferation. The effect of IL-6 on synovial cells, however, is not clear. An in vitrostudy was performed to determine the effect of IL-6 on the proliferation of synovial cells. Fibroblastic synovial cells isolated from the synovial tissues of eight RA patients were employed after the third to sixth passages. IL-6 in the presence of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) inhibited the proliferation of synovial cells in a dose-dependent manner in seven cases without increasing the number of necrotic or apoptotic cells, while TNF-{alpha} increased synovial cell proliferation in all cases. The inhibitory effect of IL-6 was observed only in the presence of sIL-6R although small amounts of IL-6R were detected in these cells by RT-PCR analysis. However, anti-IL-6R or anti-gp130 mAb treatment increased spontaneous growth of synovial cells in all eight cases, suggesting that endogenous IL-6 and a small amount of IL-6R expressed in synovial cells suppressed their growth without exogenous IL-6 or sIL-6R. In addition, the IL-6\x96sIL-6R complex reduced the TNF-{alpha}-induced proliferation of synovial cells while TNF-{alpha} induced their IL-6 production. These data suggest that IL-6 may act as a negative feedback factor for TNF-{alpha}-induced synovial cell growth.'",4
"b'Glutamate is an important amino acid in the neocortex for metabolic and neurotransmitter functions. The objective of this study was to detect variations in cellular glutamate content using quantitative immunocytochemistry. We show that glutamate is present in almost all cortical cells and coexists with other amino acids such as aspartate, glutamine or {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The patterns of aspartate and glutamine content suggests that there are no purely aspartatergic or glutaminergic neurons. GABAergic neurons showed variable levels of the precursors such as glutamate, glutamine and aspartate. Comparison of immunoreactive patterns between two cortical areas did not detect any statistically significant differences. The mean cellular intensity for GABA and glutamate was constant across different layers. Surprisingly, we found that GABAergic neurons could coexist with either low or high levels of glutamate, suggesting that metabolic levels of glutamate in these neurons could be variable. Alternatively, some GABA neurons may utilize both GABA and glutamate for neurotransmission. We show that when variations in amino acid content are separately mapped onto individual cells, co-registration is a useful technique for reporting heterogeneity among cortical cells.'",1
"b'In this study we have attempted to define the neural circuits differentially activated by cognitive interference. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify areas of the brain that are activated by the Stroop word-color task in two experiments. In the first experiment, we used infrequent, incongruent colored word stimuli to elicit strong Stroop interference (the \x91conventional Stroop\x92 paradigm). In the second experiment, we used infrequent, congruent colored words (the \x91inverse Stroop\x92 paradigm) to confirm that the regions identified in the first experiment were in fact specifically related to the Stroop effect and not to nonspecific oddball effects associated with the use of infrequent stimuli. Performance of the conventional Stroop specifically activated the anterior cingulate, insula, premotor and inferior frontal regions. These activated regions in the current experiment are consistent with those activated in fMRI experiments that use a more traditional block design. Finally, analysis of the time course of fMRI signal changes demonstrated differential onset and offset of signal changes in these activated regions. The time course results suggest that the action of various brain areas can be temporally dissociated.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b'We investigated three-dimensional, depth-encoded line representations of neocortical sulci calculated from magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets of 19 pairs of normal monozygotic twins. Monozygotic co-twins were significantly more alike than control pairs of unrelated twins matched from the same sample. Sulcal depth influenced sulcal similarity, with deeper sulci being more similar than superficial sulci. This was true both for the pairs of related co-twins and for the unrelated pairs, although the sulcal depth effect was stronger for the related twins. Our results indicate that the shape of deep (ontogenetically early) sulci of the human brain is more strongly predetermined than that of superficial sulci. The finding that sulcal similarity increased with sulcal depth especially within monozygotic twin pairs should stimulate further investigations of the relative importance of genetic versus shared environmental morphogenetic factors that must account for this result. In addition, we found that subjects with similar brain shape also have more similar sulcal patterns, suggesting that both features are the result of ontogenetically related processes. Sulcal comparisons across the entire sample suggested that the left posterior lateral hemispheric surface may be the least variable brain area. Methodologically, these results were obtained by the representation of sulci as three-dimensional polygonal lines (termed \x91sulcal cuts\x92) that are extracted automatically from MRI data sets using new image analysis techniques.'",1
"b'Background Capture-recapture methods are increasingly being used to improve surveillance for a number of diseases. However, concerns persist regarding the validity of estimates obtained.\r\n\r\nMethod Capture-recapture methods were applied to estimate the ability of four separate data sources on occupational fatalities to predict the 237 deaths (\x91gold standard\x92) we determined from a special in-depth study of medical examiner records.\r\n\r\nResults and Conclusion Capture-recapture results based upon the four sources vary according to different models. However, both separately and in aggregate of industry type and cause of death, most models seriously underestimate the gold standard, and give a misleading impression of precision of the estimate of hidden individuals. It is commonly believed that reliable estimates from such methods require lists with high coverage and parsimonious models. Here, to obtain an estimate consistent with the gold standard, the list with almost complete coverage must be discarded and a complex model fitted. It is argued that this conclusion is of widespread application.'",3
"b'Contact sensitivity (CS) is a cutaneous Th1 response that is induced by skin painting with reactive hapten. In prior in vivo studies of CS, we showed that recombinant soluble {alpha}\xdfTCR (sTCR) acted non-specifically to protect CS-effector T cells from suppression, but no molecular mechanism was determined. In the current study, we employed an in vitro system to investigate the mechanism of how sTCR protect CS-effector T cells from suppression. Immune CS-effector cells and appropriate hapten-conjugated antigen-presenting cells (APC) were incubated together with down-regulatory culture supernatant produced by suppressive spleen cells from mice tolerized i.v. with specific hapten, which produced strong inhibition of IFN-{gamma} production by the CS-effector cells. Importantly, addition of two different sTCR, of unrelated specificity, reversed this down-regulation and thus restored IFN-{gamma} production. We found that the APC, and not the CS-effector T cells, were the locus of the sTCR-mediated protection and showed direct binding of sTCR to APC by flow cytometry. Further, addition of anti-IL-12 showed that sTCR protection was due to IL-12 induced by sTCR and released by the APC, and was confirmed by ELISA measurement of IL-12 induced in APC supernatants by sTCR incubation. These results indicated a possible new regulatory loop in which suppression was reversed by IL-12 derived from APC, following direct surface binding of sTCR, and enhanced by IFN-{gamma} production from the Th1 CS-effector cells.'",4
"b""Children of alcoholics (COAs) have been characterized as an at-risk population in part, because of the dysfunctional family environments that disrupt psychosocial development among offspring exposed to parental alcoholism. This study examined the specificity of problematic family environments to children of alcoholics vs children exposed to other significant family stressors that included parental death, unemployment, separation, divorce, or major illness. University students completed self-report measures of family stressors, family relationship problems, family communication quality, family conflict, and relationship with parents. Based on a family stressor checklist, 20 students exposed only to parental alcoholism and no other family stressors were compared to several other groups exposed to specific family stressors, and to 50 control subjects who had reported no family stressors. Results showed that students from families where a parent is or was an alcoholic, and where there were no other family stressors, recall disturbed family relations no more commonly than students specifically exposed to other family stressors such as parental divorce, death, or major illness, and no more commonly than those who reported no family stressors. Further analyses suggest that the disruption of COAs' family environments may be explained by their increased likelihood of experiencing additional family stressors that can have a disruptive effect, such as parental separation, divorce and unemployment.""",0
"b""Using baseline (1987) and follow-up (1992) data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), Rodriguez et al. set out to examine the long-term consequences of different types of government benefit on the negative mental health impact of unemployment.1 The NSFH is a rich dataset which has enabled the authors to look at the short- and long-term effects of employment status and receipt of benefit, while controlling for depression score at baseline and numerous other factors that have been shown to be associated with employment status and depression, such as debt and social support. Research of this nature is important as few studies have explicitly examined the effects of government benefits on health outcomes using individual data.\r\n\r\nThe paper presents numerous findings, of which the authors choose to highlight the beneficial long-term effect of statutory benefits for mental health in unemployed women and the adverse short- and long-term effects of means-tested benefits in women who are non-employed, compared to women in full-time employment.\r\n\r\nAs many studies have convincingly linked the health effects of unemployment directly to financial problems2,3 the explanation of these findings which springs to mind is that means-tested benefits provide insufficient income to maintain mental health. However, the analyses are controlled for household income, assets and debts as well as measures of social support. The authors conclude that \x91social stigma and/or some other factors in the process associated with receiving welfare benefits could add additional stress to the lives of the recipients...\x92. Such effects were widely documented in England in the 1930s depression4,5 and again in the 1980s.6,7 However, these accounts also provide a very vivid picture of the economic hardship resulting from dependency on means-tested benefits. The corrosive effect of this hardship is experienced directly via limited access to consumer goods and indirectly through social exclusion.8 It thus seems likely that, in this population also, unrecorded material disadvantage, such as poor quality, overcrowded housing,9 or access to adequate services,10 makes a substantial contribution to the mental health differences between women in full-time employment and those on means-tested benefits. Findings from other epidemiological studies indicate that financial strain, which is particularly associated with long-term unemployment, has adverse effects on mental health.11,12\r\n\r\nMore surprising than the generally adverse associations between receipt of means-tested benefit and mental health are the apparently salutogenic long-term effects of statutory benefits for women. Statutory benefits are usually paid for a limited period and are dependent on having been in employment for a considerable period prior to job loss. Thus it is likely that these women had only been unemployed for a short time before the 1987 data collection. It is generally accepted that recent unemployment is associated with the steepest decline in mental health,13 although there is evidence that some improvement in mental health may occur immediately post-redundancy when job loss has been preceded by a period of uncertainty.14 However, the 14 women in this category have a depression index in 1992, 2.2 times lower than women in full-time employment. This salutogenic effect remains after controlling for 1992 age, education, marital status, race, limiting physical or mental illness, household characteristics including income and wealth, social support, job search history and environmental factors, and employment status, as well as index of depression and social support in 1987. However, the 37 women not working and not looking for a job but on statutory benefits in 1987, similarly have significantly lower depression scores at follow-up, although in the fully-adjusted model the difference is no longer significant. These findings lead to the conclusion that either these were exceptional women or that full-time employment has an adverse impact on mental health in certain women. Domestic responsibilities and caring have been shown to be important determinants of women's self-reported morbidity.15,16 Thus, for women who have been shouldering the burden of domestic responsibilities and caring in addition to full-time employment, a period of being at home on statutory benefits might well have positive implications for mental health. Furthermore, women's resilience to job loss is thought to be greater than men's because they have these alternative roles from which they derive a sense of self-worth.17\r\n\r\nThe other consistent conclusion to come out of the study, that part-time work has significant long-term benefits for men, also appears to support the argument that full-time employment has adverse effects on the mental health of some workers. The Second European Survey of Working Conditions found part-time and temporary workers to have significantly lower levels of stress than permanent full-time employees.18 One reason for this may lie in the work intensification which has accompanied the downsizing of workforces over the past two decades. The expectation that surviving workers expand their skills and responsibilities to cover for those dismissed has increased work pressures, which in turn have been shown to have adverse effects on mental health.19\r\n\r\nWhen respondents in employment in 1992 are split by job satisfaction a clearer picture of the mental health damaging effects of unsatisfactory work are seen. Unsatisfactory full-time employment is associated with significantly higher depression scores for both sexes, as is unsatisfactory part-time employment in women. Dissatisfaction with employment can be due to many factors, but there is evidence that people most vulnerable to unemployment are also those most likely to be in poor quality insecure jobs.20\r\n\r\nIn general, both population and redundancy studies have found job insecurity and threat of job loss to be related to significant increases in mental ill-health.21,22 These effects are not transitory, but are increased by chronic exposure to the stressor.19,23 Robust evidence of the effect of insecure employment on psychological morbidity has come from a longitudinal study of white-collar British civil servants, the Whitehall II study. In analyses adjusted for age, socioeconomic position, marital status and pre-existing morbidity, women and men re-employed in insecure jobs after losing long-term secure employment in the Civil Service had significantly higher levels of mental ill-health than those able to find secure jobs.24 These findings complement those from other studies. Unsatisfactory re-employment following factory closure among male steel workers25 and car workers26 has been shown significantly to increase depression compared with satisfactory re-employment, whereas values for the unemployed fall between. Increased depression scores among unemployed men in the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative were not reduced by re-employment in an insecure job,27 and a longitudinal population study of young women and men found psychological disorder to be higher among dissatisfied workers than in the unemployed.28\r\n\r\nQualitative studies of unemployment have provided evidence that different personal positions can lead to contrasting attitudes to being unemployed. Studies, such as those by Little29 and Fineman,30 conclude that, in a sizeable minority, unemployment gives rise to positive feelings. Of the 100 middle-class unemployed in the Fineman study, one-third saw their unemployment as an opportunity to escape from boring or stressful jobs and find employment which could meet long-frustrated needs. Those who obtained such re-employment talked of the liberating experience and the renewed energy they had for their new job. However, those who did not were left feeling inadequate and threatened in ways they had not experienced before.30\r\n\r\nTaken together such findings has led a number of researchers to conclude that \x91no job\x92 may be better than \x91any job\x92 and that cumulative labour market disadvantage may have more relevance for psychological well-being than unemployment alone""",3
"b'Heavy and problem drinking have been found to be over-represented in some studies of clinical populations, but little is known of the association of alcohol and drug use with health services utilization in the general population. General population data are reported on the association of alcohol, drug use, and demographic characteristics with use of the Emergency Room (ER) or other primary care services during the preceding year. Data analysed are from the 1995 National Alcohol Survey of respondents living in households in the 48 contiguous states. Logistic regression was used to analyse the association of substance-use variables with ER and primary care services use by gender within three ethnic groups: white (n = 1636), black (n = 1582) and Hispanic (n = 1585). Variables found to be associated with ER use were not associated with primary care services use and vice versa. Drinking and drug-use characteristics appeared to be more associated with ER use than with primary care use, and varied across ethnic and gender subgroups. The data suggest an association between treatment for alcohol or drug problems and services use, particularly among blacks and Hispanics. The data support findings from clinical studies that over-representation of substance-use problems in some clinical settings may be due to the socio-demographic characteristics of those using the facility under study, and suggest that ER and other primary care service settings may be useful for identifying those with alcohol and drug-regulated problems among specific gender/ethnic groups.'",0
"b'A central question in T cell development is what makes cortical thymocytes respond to stimulation in a qualitatively different way than any other thymocyte subset. Part of the answer is that AP-1 function changes drastically at two stages of T cell development. It undergoes striking down-regulation as thymocytes differentiate from immature, CD4\x96CD8\x96 double-negative (DN) TCR\x96 thymocytes to CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) TCRlo cortical cells, and then returns in the cells that mature to TCRhigh, CD4+CD8\x96 or CD4\x96CD8+ single-positive (SP) thymocytes. At all three stages, the jun family mRNAs can be induced similarly. However, we demonstrate that DP cortical thymocytes are specifically impaired in c-fos and fosB mRNA induction, even when stimuli are used that optimize survival of the cells and a form of in vitro maturation. fra-2 expression is induction independent but much lower in DP cells than in the other subsets. Overall Fos family protein induction accordingly is severely decreased in DP cells. Defective c-Fos and FosB expression in cortical thymocytes is functionally significant, because antibody supershift experiments show that in activated immature and mature thymocytes, most detectable AP-1 DNA-binding complexes do contain c-Fos or FosB. Thus, defective c-Fos and FosB expression in cortical thymocytes qualitatively alters any AP-1 complexes they might express. The cortical thymocytes are not deficient in mRNA expression for any of the constitutive transcription factors that are known to be needed to drive c-Fos or FosB expression, so it is possible that the activity of these factors is developmentally regulated through a post-transcriptional mechanism.'",4
"b'The name glypican has been assigned to a family of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans that are linked to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. To date, six family members of this family have been identified in mammals (GPC1 to GPC6) and two in Drosophila. Glypicans are expressed predominantly during development, and they are thought to play a role in morphogenesis. As HS-carrying molecules, glypicans were initially considered potential regulators of heparin-binding growth factors. This has been recently confirmed by genetic interaction experiments showing that glypicans regulate wingless signaling in Drosophila. The involvement of glypicans in the in vivo regulation of other heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors, remains to be determined. Interestingly and unexpectedly, a role for GPC3 in the regulation of insulin-like growth factors has been proposed. This hypothesis is based on the phenotype of patients with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS), an overgrowth and dysmorphic syndrome in which the GPC3 gene is mutated. Thus, it is possible that glypicans regulate different kinds of growth factors in a tissue-specific manner. In addition to its involvement in SGBS, down-regulation of GPC3 has been recently associated with the progression of several types of malignant tumors, including mesotheliomas and ovarian cancer. A role for GPC1 in pancreatic cancer progression has also been proposed.'",2
"b'Background The quality of mortality statistics is of crucial importance to epidemiological research. Traditional editing techniques used by statistical offices capture only obvious errors in death certification. In this study we match Swedish hospital discharge data to death certificates and discuss the implications for mortality statistics.\r\n\r\nMethods Swedish death certificates for 1995 were linked to the national hospital discharge register. The resulting database comprised 69 818 individuals (75% of all deaths), 39 872 (43%) of whom died in hospital. The diagnostic statements were compared at Basic Tabulation List level.\r\n\r\nResults The last main diagnosis and the underlying cause of death agreed in 46% of cases. Agreement decreased rapidly after discharge. For hospital deaths, the main diagnosis was reported on 83% of the certificates, but only on 46% of certificates for non-hospital deaths. Malignant neoplasms and other dramatic conditions showed the best agreement and were often reported as underlying causes. Conditions that might follow from some other disease were often reported as contributory causes, while symptomatic and some chronic conditions were often omitted. In 13% of cases, an ill-defined main condition was replaced by a more specific cause of death.\r\n\r\nConclusions There is no apparent reason to question the death certificate if the main diagnosis and underlying cause agree, or if the main diagnosis is a probable complication of the stated underlying cause. However, cases in which the main diagnosis cannot be considered a complication of the reported underlying cause should be investigated, and assessments made of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of routinely linking hospital records to death certificates.'",3
"b""The aims of this study were to: (1) document women's alcohol use over a 5-year period; (2) compare different measures of alcohol consumption such as high alcohol consumption (HAC) and high episodic drinking (HED); (3) to follow the incidence and course of alcohol dependence and abuse (ADA). The study is part of a longitudinal general population-based study, Women and Alcohol in G\xf6teborg. From a stratified random sample of 479 respondents, 399 were interviewed in the first wave (1989/90). In the second wave (1995/96), 386 of the 479 women were available for a follow-up interview. The 12-month prevalence of ADA was 1.3% in both waves. In the longitudinal analysis the 5-year cumulative incidence of ADA was 0.1%. Two new cases of ADA were found. The prevalence of HAC and HED decreased in women of all ages except HED in women born in 1955. We conclude that the 12-month prevalence of ADA remained the same at the 5-year follow-up and that, in contrast to what has been found in some other studies, there was an overall decrease in HAC and in HED.""",0
"b'Neuroimaging studies have revealed that the functional organization of reading differs between developmentally dyslexic and nonimpaired individuals. However, it is not clear how early in the reading process the differences between fluent and dyslexic readers start to emerge. We studied cortical activity of ten dyslexic adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG), as they silently read words or viewed symbol-strings which were clearly visible or degraded with Gaussian noise. This method has previously been used to dissociate between analysis of local features and pre-lexical word processing in fluent adult readers. Signals peaking around 100 ms after stimulus onset and originating in the postero-medial extrastriate cortex were associated with increasing local luminance contrast in the noise patches. These early visual responses were similar in dyslexic and non-impaired readers. In contrast, the letter-string-specific responses peaking around 150 ms predominantly in the left inferior occipito-temporal cortex in fluent readers were undetectable in dyslexic readers. Thus, while the early visual processing seems intact in dyslexic adults, the pattern of cortical activation starts to differ from that of fluent readers at the point where letter-stringspecific signals first emerge during reading.'",1
"b'Background The seventh cholera pandemic has been ongoing in Mexico since 1991 and threatens to become endemic. This paper aims to determine the geographical pattern of cholera in Mexico to define areas at high risk of endemic cholera.\r\n\r\nMethods Ecologic research was conducted based upon the cartography of disease incidence. The 32 Mexican states were grouped into five strata according to the value of the 1991\x961996 cumulative incidence rate of cholera. Rate ratios were computed for strata of states classified by geographical situation, urbanization, and poverty level.\r\n\r\nResults Cholera incidence was 2.47 times higher in coastal states than in the interior (95% CI : 2.42\x962.52). The disease was negatively associated with urbanization. Incidence in the least urbanized stratum was four times as high as in the most urban stratum (95% CI : 3.9\x964.12). The poorest stratum showed the most remarkable incidence, i.e. 5.9 times higher than the rate in the least poor stratum (95% CI : 5.73\x966.04).\r\n\r\nConclusions This ecologic research suggests that high poverty level, low urbanization, and southern location are the most important predictors of endemic cholera in Mexican states. It is hypothesized that the natural environment of the coastal plains in southern states may also play a significant role in cholera incidence. Poor communities residing in the southern, predominantly rural, coastal states should be prioritized when it comes to investing in safe water supply facilities, adequate excreta disposal systems and cholera surveillance.'",3
"b'Unfertilized eggs of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus are surrounded by a gelatinous layer rich in sulfated fucan. Shortly after fertilization this polysaccharide disappears, but 24 h later the embryos synthesize high amounts of dermatan sulfate concomitantly with the mesenchyme blastula\x96early gastrula stage when the larval gut is forming. This glycosaminoglycan has the same backbone structure [4-{alpha}-L-IdoA-1->3-\xdf-D-GalNAc-1]n as the mammalian counterpart but possesses a different sulfation pattern. It has a high content of 4-O- and 6-O-disulfated galactosamine units. In addition, chains of this dermatan sulfate are considerable longer than those of vertebrate tissues. Adult sea urchin tissues contain high concentrations of sulfated polysaccharides, but dermatan sulfate is restricted to the adult body wall where it accounts for ~20% of the total sulfated polysaccharides. In addition, sulfation at the 4-O-position decreases markedly in the dermatan sulfate from adult sea urchin when compared with the glycan from larvae. Overall, these results demonstrate the occurrence of dermatan sulfates with unique sulfation patterns in this marine invertebrate. The physiological implication of these oversulfated dermatan sulfates is unclear. One hypothesis is that interactions between components of the extracellular matrix in marine invertebrates occur at higher salt concentrations than in vertebrates and therefore require glycosaminoglycans with increased charge density.'",2
"b'Antibodies against the histo-blood group B\x96like antigen M-N#1 efficiently block the growth in vivo of rat mammary carcinoma cells that bear the antigen (Sleeman et al., 1999Go, Oncogene 18, 4485\x964494). To try to understand the function of the M-N#1 antigen, we investigated when and where the antigen is expressed during the normal function of the rat mammary gland. Expression was virtually only seen during mammary gland involution. Here, strong expression of the antigen was observed in mammary epithelial cells, beginning around 2 days postweaning and lasting throughout the involution process. Dexamethasone treatment of animals postlactation inhibited alveolar collapse and remodeling in the mammary gland but inhibited neither the apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells nor the expression of the M-N#1 antigen. We show that up-regulation of carbohydrate antigens is not a general phenomenon during mammary gland involution, and thus that M-N#1 antigen expression is specifically regulated. Up-regulation of {alpha}(1,2)fucosyltransferase A, an enzyme required for M-N#1 antigen synthesis, is at least partly responsible for regulated M-N#1 antigen expression postlactation. Most significantly, we observed that the M-N#1 antigen is virtually exclusively expressed on nonapoptosing epithelial cells in the involuting mammary gland. These data suggest that M-N#1 antigen expression might either provide a survival function and/or be expressed in epithelial cells that are destined to grow and remodel mammary duct structures.'",2
"b'Background Nicotine dependence is a significant public health problem. This study attempted to characterize the prevalence and familial aggregation of nicotine dependence in China.\r\n\r\nMethods In 1998, we initiated a community-based cross-sectional study among residents of the Yuexi County in Anqing, China. A total of 991 current smokers from 488 randomly selected nuclear families were recruited and surveyed by use of the standardized Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) questionnaire and the Revised Tolerance Questionnaire (RTQ). All study subjects were offspring in their respective nuclear families, and 478 male-male pairs (aged 41.7 \xb1 12.1 years) were finally used for data analyses, because the number of female current smokers (n = 5) was too small.\r\n\r\nResults The correlation coefficient of the FTND and the RTQ scores was as high as 0.84 (P < 0.0001). Nicotine dependence, defined as an FTND score >=8 or an RTQ score >=28, had a prevalence of 12.7% and 11.1%, respectively. The respective sibling recurrent risk was 1.7 and 2.4, according to the FTND or the RTQ criteria. The adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI of nicotine dependence of second siblings in families in which the first sibling was nicotine dependent were 2.13 (95% CI : 1.02\x964.43) and 3.50 (95% CI : 1.65\x967.36) respectively, according to the FTND and RTQ criteria.\r\n\r\nConclusions The prevalence of nicotine dependence in male current smokers in China was comparable to that reported in previous US and European studies. Our findings suggest that genetic influences may play an important role in vulnerability to nicotine addiction.'",3
"b'Background In many western countries an increase in incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and/or gastric cardia have been reported. The aim of this study was to describe and compare trends in incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and gastric cardia in several areas of Europe, 1968\x961995, using Eurocim (a database of cancer incidence and mortality data from 95 European cancer registries).\r\n\r\nMethods Time-trends in age-standardized incidence rates of adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastric cardia are described in 11 population-based cancer registries from 10 countries in North, South, East, West and Central Europe, 1968\x961995. The statistical significance of the time-trends in incidence was assessed using Poisson regression analysis.\r\n\r\nResults An increase in incidence of adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastric cardia was observed in Northern Europe (Denmark), Southern Europe (Italy, Varese), Eastern Europe (Slovakia) and Western Europe (England and Wales, Scotland). In Central Europe (Switzerland, Basel) and in the cancer registries of Iceland (Northern Europe), France, Bas-Rhin and Calvados, Southern Ireland, and the Netherlands, Eindhoven (Western Europe) no rise in incidence was observed. The increase in incidence of adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastric cardia was accompanied by a decrease in incidence of both adenocarcinomas and non-adenocarcinomas of the non-cardia part of the stomach in almost all of the 11 cancer registries studied. Increased histological verification of tumours of the oesophagus and stomach and improvement in precision of histological diagnosis may partly explain the increase in incidence of adenocarcinomas in some registries.\r\n\r\nConclusions This study, using Eurocim data, supports the findings from other time-trend studies of population-based cancer registries in western countries.'",3
"b'Isolate GS4-97 was purified from an extraction juice sample of an Austrian beet sugar factory and affiliated to the newly described species Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus.

"b'T cells involved in autoimmune diseases have been characterized by the genetic elements used to construct their autoimmune TCR. In the present study, we sequenced the {alpha} and \xdf chains of the TCR expressed by a CD4+ T cell clone, C9, functional in NOD mouse diabetes. Clone C9 can adoptively transfer diabetes or, when attenuated, C9 can be used to vaccinate NOD mice against diabetes. Clone C9 recognizes a peptide epitope (p277) of the 60 kDa heat shock protein (hsp60) molecule. We now report that the C9 TCR \xdf chain features a CDR3 peptide sequence that is prevalent among NOD mice. This CDR3 element is detectable by 2 weeks of age in the thymus, and later in the spleen and in the autoimmune insulitis. Thus, a TCR CDR3\xdf sequence appears to be a common idiotope associated with mouse diabetes'",4
"b'Sir\x97A number of reports suggest that some occupational exposures of males may alter the gender ratio of their offspring. Reduction in male offspring has been observed after exposures to hyperbaric chambers1 and among professional drivers,2 applicators of dibromochloropropane,3 carbon setters4 and aluminum smelter workers.5 Weijin and Olsen6 have suggested that offspring gender ratio, because of its correlation with reduced fertility, may be a possible epidemiological indicator of reproductive hazards.\r\n\r\nWe have conducted a study to evaluate the possible role of exposure to metal fumes (particularly nickel and chromium) on the reproductive health of male workers in an Italian mint. The study was designed to evaluate specifically fertility problems, and the observed reduction in fertility is reported separately. We also noted, however, an interesting alteration of the gender ratio with reduced male births which we feel is worth reporting.\r\n\r\nThe workers were divided into administrative staff (non-exposed to metal fumes), technical and maintenance staff (with minimal exposure), coin stampers (exposed to metal fumes) and founders (highly exposed to metal fumes). Air sampling and biological monitoring of workers yielded concentrations of metals within the TLV-ACGIH. However, the blood nickel levels were very near the biological reference value of 0.5 \xb5g/dl, especially among founders.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of male children among all offspring born to these men while working in the four job categories is shown in Table 1Go. Founders had a significantly reduced proportion of male children when compared to both the administrative staff and to the general population, where the proportion of males is 51%. We focused more specifically on the most recent birth of these workers, because information on exposure was more detailed for the last pregnancy of the couple. Again we note a reduction in the births of males among founders, which is statistically significant.'",3
"b'In 1989 in an article entitled \x91Beyond cholesterol: modifications of low-density lipoprotein that increase its atherogenicity\x92 that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine Daniel Steinberg et al. highlighted the potentially important role of oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in atherogenesis.1 This laboratory work led epidemiologists to examine the association between intake of antioxidants (substances that might stop the oxidation of LDL-cholesterol such as beta-carotene) in the diet of free-living humans and subsequent cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nObservational studies reported a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death in those who ate diets rich in beta-carotene. In a meta-analysis the pooled relative risk reduction was 31% (95% CI : 41\x9620%, P < 0.0001) when those with high beta-carotene intake or serum beta-carotene levels were compared with those with low intakes or levels.2 Several trials of beta-carotene, which had been set up to examine the effect of antioxidants on cancer incidence then reported their results in the mid 1990s. The randomized trials did not confirm the beneficial association seen in observational studies. Instead, they reported a moderate adverse effect of beta-carotene supplementation with a relative increase in the risk of cardiovascular death of 12% (95% CI : 4\x9622%, P = 0.005).2 The results of these six observational studies and four randomized trials are summarized'",3
"b'The emerging class of B cell superantigens includes HIV-1 gp120, which binds to many members of the VH3 Ig gene family. The present study addresses the structural features of VH3 antibodies conferring gp120 binding activity using a panel of recombinant full-length and Fab Ig proteins. Binding activity was fully conferred by the Fab portion of the Ig molecule. The VH region was the major determinant of binding; diverse light chains were permissive for gp120 binding. A series of recombinant VH3\x96VH1 chimeric molecules was created to analyze the contribution of different subregions of VH3 to gp120 binding. Hypervariable loop 1 (H1) substitution alone caused a 10-fold reduction in binding activity. The framework subregions (FR1, FR2 and FR3) and H2 also influenced binding, since substitutions of various combinations of these subregions conferred 10- to 100-fold binding reductions. We conclude that gp120 binding occurs through a non-conventional interaction involving multiple discontinuously arrayed residues spanning the VH, and including roles in gp120 contact and favorable conformation of the VH.'",4
"b'Several possible risk factors for ICD-10 alcohol dependence were studied by comparing cases (117 men, 188 women) with controls (248 men, 300 women). Logistic regression analyses showed that parental alcohol problems and high trait anxiety were significantly related to high occurrence of alcohol dependence in both men and women. In women, high antisocial behaviour, high impulsivity, and high externality were also related to high occurrence of alcohol dependence. High facial flushing and high stimulation when intoxicated were related to low occurrence of alcohol dependence in both men and women. In men, this was also the case for high social support. Several interactions were observed. In contrast to earlier studies, there was no significant association between alcohol dependence and left-handedness.'",0
"b'Local injection of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) induces a local immune response, with activation of viral superantigen (vSAG)-specific T cell subsets followed by their clonal deletion. We investigated the fate of vSAG-reactive T cells following footpad injection of MMTV(SW) to mice. Activated T cells accumulated in draining lymph nodes. However, we demonstrated that apoptosis did not occur at the activation site, on the contrary of what has been shown after bacterial SAG activation. Although activated T cells were already shown to have the capacity to migrate to the gut, the fate of gut homing cells remains unclear. We demonstrate that the number of vSAG-specific T cells activated in the periphery was increasing in the follicles of gut-associated lymphoid organs, together with the number of apoptotic cell clusters. These results strongly suggested that gut-associated lymphoid tissue was the specific graveyard for apoptotic vSAG-activated CD4 T cells.'",4
"b'An analysis of [alpha]1->3fucosyltransferase expression and enzyme properties has been conducted in human lung carcinoma NCI-H69 and PC9 cells. The results indicate that multiple forms of [alpha]1->3 fucosyltransferase are found in these cells. RT-PCR experiments using total RNA from NCI-H69 and PC9 cells amplified transcripts for three of these enzymes, FucT-IV, -VI, and -VII. Fucose transfer into glycolipid acceptors mediated by truncated chimeric and full length recombinant FucT-IV and -VI enzymes was examined. Both enzymes were found to be type 2 chain specific, but only FucT-VI efficiently transferred fucose to both neutral and sialylated acceptors. A truncated recombinant form of FucT-VI was capable of fucose transfer to the internal Glc residue of a variety of glycolipid acceptors. This property was not observed with the recombinant full length enzyme, suggesting the N-terminal portion of the protein, composed of the intracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and a part of the stem region, is involved in interactions with glycolipid acceptors. Using taurodeoxycholate as the detergent, the distribution of initial fucose transfer into nLc6 catalyzed by recombinant full length enzyme indicated 34% of the mono-fucosyl product was fucosylated at the III-GlcNAc and 66% at the V-GlcNAc for FucT-IV, and almost all of the FucT-VI mono-fucosyl product was III-GlcNAc fucosylated. Similar experiments with VI2NeuAcnLc6 as the acceptor resulted in predominantly III-GlcNAc monofucosylation, although detectable V-GlcNAc monofucosylation was obtained with FucT-VI. When the cationic detergent G-3634-A was used, substantially greater initial transfer into the V-GlcNAc of both neutral and sialylated acceptors with FucT-VI was observed. Using nonsialylated acceptors, total [alpha]1->3 fucosyltransferase activity in NCI-H69 cells was analyzed and found to be diminished 25-30% by exposure to 30 mM NEM, which can be attributed to FucT-VI inactivation. The remaining 70-75% of NEM-resistant activity is attributed to FucT-IV, an NEM-resistant enzyme form capable of fucosylating nonsialylated acceptors. These results suggest that multiple forms of [alpha]1->3fucosyltransferase are expressed in NCI-H69 and PC9 cells, which may account for the observed properties of enzyme derived from these cell lines.'",2
"b'Background A large population in West Bengal, India has been exposed to naturally occurring inorganic arsenic through their drinking water. A cross-sectional survey involving 7683 participants of all ages was conducted in an arsenic-affected region between April 1995 and March 1996. The main focus of the study was skin keratoses and pigmentation alterations, two characteristic signs of ingested inorganic arsenic. Strong exposure-response gradients were found for these skin lesions. The study also collected limited information concerning respiratory system signs and symptoms, which we report here because increasing evidence suggests that arsenic ingestion also causes pulmonary effects.\r\n\r\nMethods Participants were clinically examined and interviewed, and the arsenic content in their current primary drinking water source was measured. There were few smokers and analyses were confined to non-smokers (N = 6864 participants).\r\n\r\nResults Among both males and females, the prevalence of cough, shortness of breath, and chest sounds (crepitations and/or rhonchi) in the lungs rose with increasing arsenic concentrations in drinking water. These respiratory effects were most pronounced in individuals with high arsenic water concentrations who also had skin lesions. Prevalence odds ratio (POR) estimates were markedly increased for participants with arsenic-induced skin lesions who also had high levels of arsenic in their current drinking water source (>=500 \xb5g/l) compared with individuals who had normal skin and were exposed to low levels of arsenic (<50 \xb5g/l). In participants with skin lesions, the age-adjusted POR estimates for cough were 7.8 for females (95% CI : 3.1\x9619.5) and 5.0 for males (95% CI : 2.6\x969.9); for chest sounds POR for females was 9.6 (95% CI : 4.0\x9622.9) and for males 6.9 (95% CI : 3.1\x9615.0). The POR for shortness of breath in females was 23.2 (95% CI : 5.8\x9692.8) and in males 3.7 (95% CI : 1.3\x9610.6).\r\n\r\nConclusion These results add to evidence that long-term ingestion of inorganic arsenic can cause respiratory effects.'",3
"b'Mice carrying a transgenic TCR with targeted disruption of the TCR {alpha} chain (H-Y {alpha}\x96/\x96) possess CD4+ T cells which express the transgenic TCR \xdf without the {alpha} chain. These mice developed the murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) after infection with LP-BM5 retroviruses, a process which requires CD4+ T cells. These cells are negative for TCR {delta} chain and pre-TCR {alpha} chain expression, and thus express a unique surface receptor with the TCR \xdf chain as a component. The cells respond to MAIDS virus-associated superantigen and concanavalin A, but not to protein antigens such as ovalbumin. Thus, this novel surface receptor appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MAIDS.'",4
"b'Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is considered to be a promising candidate marker of alcohol consumption, but exhibits a short window of detection in blood or urine. Keratinized tissues are known to retain foreign substances and to provide a greater retrospective window of detection than body fluids. Therefore, post-mortem hair, skin swabs, and stratum corneum samples were collected from four subjects with a reported history of alcohol misuse and from seven subjects with a report of regular, socially accepted drinking behaviour, and were investigated for EtG. Additionally, certain specimens were collected from three children, who had not yet consumed any alcoholic beverages. EtG was detectable in most of the hair and stratum corneum samples as well as in perspiration stains from alcohol-consuming subjects. The results indicated that EtG might be formed locally in very small and highly variable amounts. The most important finding was that EtG cannot be expected to be generally detectable in keratinized tissues or perspiration stains from alcohol-drinking subjects, whereas a positive result is always associated with recent alcohol consumption.'",0
"b""Our contribution \x91Social epidemiology? No way\x92 was meant to be provocative. Unfortunately, the comments made by Macdonald, Krieger, Siegrist, McPherson and Kaufman using qualifications as \x91illogic\x92, \x91narrow\x92, \x91sloppy\x92, and \x91silly\x92 indicate that our contribution is taken to be offensive. That was certainly not our intention and we like to stress that we do value the contribution of sociology and psychology to the understanding of health phenomena. Naturally, we realise that not only biological, physical, and chemical factors, but also the social environment and psyche, influence disease occurrence and outcome. We focus in this reaction on the core critical statements of Macdonald, Krieger, Siegrist, McPherson and Kaufman regarding (1) boundaries between disciplines, (2) training and (3) the importance of subject matter knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe main critique is that it is unnecessary and counterproductive to draw boundaries between disciplines. We agree that cross-fertilization between biological and social knowledge may lead to insights that would otherwise not have been developed. We also realise that these factors may interact and that biomedical, sociological and psychological expertise may be necessary to unravel pathogenesis and prognosis. Multi-disciplinary research teams may be formed whenever necessary or when they are expected to be productive. However, we strongly oppose mono-disciplinary trained professionals using their own tools to make inquiries in neighbouring fields or borrowing tools from the latter without understanding the field for which these tools are made. Shopping in neighbouring scientific fields will only be beneficial when shoppers possess (or combine) expertise in both fields. This is the exceptional case, rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nWe do not object to use of the term \x91social epidemiology\x92 for the exceptional case of a combination of expertise. In other situations where social determinants of disease are studied, it is best to call these activities sociology, because it is clear to everyone that the basis of such activities rests on sociological theory. Using the word \x91epidemiology\x92 in such a context would only refer to the method (frequency research) and biostatistics would be a better term. Epidemiology is not defined by its method but by its object (occurrence of disease) and it has never been disputed that the basis of epidemiology rests on (bio)medical theory. It is our impression (and we gave examples) that this important element is not appreciated by the proponents of social epidemiology. Krieger takes the argument one step further, stating that training in solely biomedical sciences is always insufficient. We do not agree. Although social and biomedical determinants may often interact, we do not believe the world to be such a hybrid that research questions cannot be studied without expertise in both fields. If Krieger is right, we would need to redesign almost all epidemiology training programmes in the US and Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Krieger, Macdonald states that thorough subject knowledge is not necessary to generate and evaluate hypotheses. Indeed, we did not need \x91thorough\x92 knowledge about polycyclic aryl hydrocarbons to \x91prove\x92 that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. We needed some biomedical knowledge, however, to know that carrying a cigarette lighter does not cause lung cancer. Logical thinking and common sense without expertise would not have prevented this latter conclusion being reached. Although Macdonald disagrees, we firmly believe that epidemiological research should be based on deductive reasoning and/or biomedical theory, but this is an empirical cyclical process, which may start with little understanding of disease mechanisms. For the same reason, Siegrist's term \x91biomedical epidemiology\x92 should also be avoided. After all, epidemiology always deals with improving biomedical theories! Just like sociology always deals with improving social theories. For clinical and community medicine both are important, but should not be intermixed.\r\n\r\n""",3
"b'The Plinius Maior Society is a European multinational, multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers in the alcoholism field, which strives for a comprehensive care concept in the management of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. The Society, using evidence-based medicine, has developed a set of protocols, in the forms of guidelines, flow-charts, leaflets and booklets, for use as tools in research on and treatment of alcohol dependence, with a view to standardize clinical research procedures and to bridge the gap between the alcoholism researcher, practitioner and patient. These protocols or tools have been subjected to a review process during their preparation, and further comments on their validity will be integrated in their updates. Seven protocols have so far been developed, two of which, \x91Guidelines on Evaluation of Treatment of Alcohol Dependence\x92 and \x91Detection and Management of Patients with Psychiatric and Alcohol Use Disorders\x92, are aimed at the clinical researcher and specialists, whereas three others [in the form of decision trees (flow-charts)] are aimed at the general practitioner and other primary health care providers. These are entitled \x91Alcohol Risk Assessment and Intervention in Primary Care\x92, \x91Withdrawal from Alcohol at Home\x92 and \x91Brief Intervention in Patients with Alcohol-Related Problems\x92. The remaining two tools are booklets aimed at the patient, one to support initiatives for detection of drinking problems and primary intervention, namely \x91Do you have this Problem? Discuss it with your Doctor!\x92, and the other to assist the patient in relapse prevention after the early stages of treatment, namely \x91On the Way to Recovery\x92. The protocols for the general practitioners and patients have so far been produced in seven European languages, and, as with the Guidelines, feedback from target users will be collected and incorporated in future updates. The Society continually seeks to consider areas of clinical importance for its work and, as it enters the new millennium, it hopes to address and make a significant contribution to the most pressing problem in the management of alcohol dependence, namely relapse.'",0
"b'We have studied IL-12p35-deficient (IL-12p35\x96/\x96) mice to evaluate the role of IL-12 in resistance against Listeria monocytogenes. In the absence of bioactive IL-12p75, mutant mice acquired higher bacterial organ burden than wild-type mice and died during the first week following infection with normally sublethal doses of Listeria. Moreover, blood IFN-{gamma} levels were strikingly reduced in mutant mice at day 2 post-infection. These results suggest that in IL-12p35-deficient mice impaired production of IFN-{gamma} which is crucial for activation of listericidal effector functions of macrophages leads to defective innate immunity against Listeria. In contrast to mice deficient for IFN-{gamma} or IFN-{gamma} receptor which are unable to resist very low infection doses of Listeria, IL-12p35\x96/\x96 mice resisted up to 1000 c.f.u. and were able to eliminate Listeria. Spleen cells from mutant mice re-stimulated with heat-killed Listeria produced considerable amounts of IFN-{gamma}, suggesting that at low dose infection sufficient IFN-{gamma} is produced independently of IL-12. Subsequent challenge of these immunized mice with high doses of L. monocytogenes resulted in sterile elimination demonstrating efficient memory responses. These results demonstrate for the first time that at low doses of Listeria IL-12 is neither critical for innate immunity nor for the development of protective T cell-dependent acquired immunity.'",4
"b'The glycobiology of Schistosoma mansoni is dominated by developmentally regulated expression of various fucosylated structures, most notably the Lewis X epitope and a multifucosylated sequence, Fuc{alpha}1->2Fuc{alpha}1->, in its various forms. For the infective cercarial stage, Lewis X has been structurally identified on glycosphingolipids and N-glycans of total glycoprotein extracts, and a population of multifucosylated glycoproteins were found to carry a unique terminal sequence, \xb1Fuc{alpha}1->2Fuc{alpha}1->[3GalNAc\xdf1->4(Fuc{alpha}1->2Fuc{alpha}1-> 2Fuc{alpha}1->3)GlcNAc\xdf1->3Gal{alpha}1->]n, on their O-glycans. Using a mass spectrometry approach coupled with chromatographic separation, sequential exoglycosidase digestion, periodate oxidation, and other chemical derivatization, we demonstrate that Lewis X could also be carried on the cercarial O-glycans, but the two distinctive sets of fucosylated epitopes were conjugated to two different core structures. Lewis X, lacNAc, or single GlcNAc was found to attach directly to the ->3Gal\xdf1->3GalNAc core and indirectly via another \xdf-Gal residue branching off from C6 of the reducing end GalNAc to give a biantennary-like structure. The ->3(\xb1Gal\xdf1->6)Gal\xdf1->3(->3Gal\xdf1->6)GalNAc core thus characterized represents a novel core type for O-glycans. In contrast, the previously characterized multifucosylated terminal sequences were carried on conventional type 1 and 2 cores. The smallest structures of the reductively released O-glycans were defined as GalNAc\xdf1->4GlcNAc\xdf1->3Gal\xdf1->3GalNAcitol with a total of two to four fucoses attached to the terminal lacdiNAc. {alpha}-Galactosylation of the nonreducing terminal \xdf-GalNAc instead of fucose capping leads to further elongation with another lacdiNAc unit that could also extend directly from C6 of the reducing end GalNAc and similarly elongated or terminated.'",2
"b'The TCR signals are essential for T cell activation and proliferation, primarily through the induction of cytokine and cytokine receptors. Several transcription factor families, including NF-{kappa}B/Rel, have been implicated in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells in response to antigen, cytokine and mitogenic stimulation. In this study, we show that the mice with a null mutation in the lymphoid-specific c-Rel gene have normal development of lymphoid tissues and T cell compartment. However, T cells derived from the c-Rel knockout mice have several functional abnormalities. The c-Rel-deficient T lymphocytes fail to respond to activation and proliferation signals mediated by the TCR and mitogens in vitro. This is attributed to an impaired production of cytokines IL-2, IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. In addition, the induction of IL-2R{alpha} chain is impaired in the c-Rel\x96/\x96 T cells. The poor expression of cytokines and IL-2R{alpha} chain correlates with a reduced nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B components in c-Rel\x96/\x96 T cells. Since activation is prerequisite for differentiation into effector cells, c-Rel\x96/\x96 T cells failed to differentiate into cytotoxic T cells or Th cells without rescuing cytokines. However, upon supplement with exogenous IL-2, the c-Rel\x96/\x96 cytotoxic T lymphocytes are able to execute cytotoxicity and the c-Rel\x96/\x96 Th cells are capable of providing help to normal B cells. These data suggest that c-Rel is important for inducible cytokine and cytokine receptor expression, and a key regulator of early activation and proliferation in T cells.'",4
"b'This study investigated the effect of the consumption of wine, beer and spirits on self-reported health status. Methods: A sample of 14 950 individuals was randomly selected from the total population register in Sweden in 1996\x9697. Their self-reported health status and consumption of wine, beer and spirits were assessed at face-to-face interviews. Results: Of 11 606 individuals in the age range 16\x9684 years, 2659 reported a poor health status. Consumption of wine was associated with a decreased odds ratio (OR) (0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50\x960.63) for poor, self-reported health status, as compared with non-users. Consumers of fortified wine, beer, strong beer and hard liquor had a similar, self-reported health status to that of non-consumers. The results were adjusted for age, sex and total alcohol consumption. Adjustments for body-mass index, smoking, educational level and physical activity did not change the results. The relationship between poor self-reported health status and intake of wine had a form similar to a \x91U\x92 with the lowest OR among individuals consuming small to moderate amounts of wine. Conclusions: The study shows that a moderate consumption of wine was associated with a positive effect on the self-reported health status. Factors related to lifestyle may be underlying causes.\r\n\r\n'",0
"b'Drink-driving remains a major problem of public health (Alvarez and Del Rio, 1996Go). One of the most controversial issues is the choice of legal limit, as the ability to drive can be affected by alcohol levels well below current legal limits (Dunbar et al., 1987Go; Howat et al., 1991Go; Guppy, 1994Go). This study addressed the questions of the self-estimation of ability to drive, and its correlation with blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) measured with a breath-ethanol analyser in a population of non-professional male soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn November 1997, at 23:00, during the last evening of a 3-week military course, in Geneva barracks, soldiers were asked to fill in a questionnaire including birth date, CAGE test, self-evaluation of ability to drive, and self-estimation of BAC. All gave informed consent and were instructed that the legal Swiss drink-drive limit is 0.8 mg/ml (80 mg/dl). BAC was measured after the completion of the questionnaire with a Lion Alcometer SD 400TM breath-ethanol analyser. Although the gold standard for alcohol determination should be a blood testing, we decided to use a breath-ethanol analyser, as it is accepted as a reliable screening method by police authorities.\r\n\r\nFifty-three out of 73 men (73%) were included (15 men were sleeping and 5 were working and therefore could not participate). All had a driving licence. Median age was 28 years (range: 21 to 41 years). Forty-one were ordinary soldiers, nine under-officers, and three officers. Forty-five subjects (85%) admitted having consumed alcohol at the time of completing the questionnaire. The CAGE test was positive (>=2 points) in three subjects, all of whom had consumed alcohol at the time of the investigation. Among the alcohol consumers, median (range) self-estimated BAC was 0.8 mg/ml (0.1 to 1.8), and median measured BAC was 0.3 mg/ml (0 to 1.5) (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Six men had measured BAC higher than 0.8 mg/ml. Ability to drive estimations relative to BAC are reported in Table 1Go, from which three points arise.\r\nFirst, in this population of soldiers the prevalence of alcohol consumption during that particular day was high (85%), probably because this investigation was performed during the final evening of the military course, when soldiers traditionally drink more than usual. Moreover, Swiss biennial military courses are traditional occasions for high alcohol consumption, and 20 soldiers working or sleeping were not evaluated.\r\nSecond, self-reported BAC was always overestimated, when compared to measured BAC, probably because the questionnaire was performed in the early elimination phase of alcohol (Seidl et al., 1996Go).\r\n\r\nThird, according to other studies (Sharman et al., 1978Go; Beirness, 1987Go), self-estimation of ability to drive correlated with neither estimated, nor measured, BAC. Nine out of 25 (36%) subjects estimating their BAC to be above 0.8 mg/ml declared themselves to be able to drive, which meant that they were liable to break the drink-driving law in Switzerland. Conversely, 13 out of 18 (72%) who declared themselves to be unable to drive would have been allowed to according to the Swiss law.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, most of these intoxicated soldiers (72%) would not have been committing an offence according to Swiss law, although they felt unfit to drive. With a legal drink-drive limit of 0.5 mg/ml (50 mg/dl), this proportion would have been reduced by half (39%). Although no test of competence to drive was administered in this study, the data presented do raise concerns about the relationship between perceived levels of intoxication and inability to drive and blood-alcohol level. This suggests that Swiss authorities and other countries in which the legal drink-drive limit is 0.8 mg/ml (80 mg/dl) should rethink their drink-drive policy. One suggestion is the harmonization of a maximum BAC at 0.5 mg/ml (50 mg/dl) throughout the European countries (European Transport Safety Council, 1995Go).'",0
"b'Gangliosides are able to bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor and inhibit its activation, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. To address the role of receptor carbohydrates in facilitating interaction with gangliosides, we examined the ability of GM3 to bind the deglycosylated receptor and inhibit its autophosphorylation. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that deglycosylation of the receptor did not affect its ability to be transported to the cell membrane. In contrast with the native (fully glycosylated) receptor, GM3 did not coimmunoprecipitate with the deglycosylated receptor. Using a novel colorimetric bead binding assay, GM3 was shown to bind well to the immunoprecipitated native receptor but not at all to the deglycosylated receptor. Finally, the addition of GM3 to cells with deglycosylated epidermal growth factor receptors did not result in significant further inhibition of autophosphorylation of the receptor, despite a 10-fold decrease in phosphorylation of the native epidermal growth factor receptor by 200 \xb5M GM3. These studies suggest that ganglioside affects epidermal growth factor receptor activity through a direct interaction that requires receptor glycosylation, and contribute to our understanding of the role of gangliosides in cell membrane function.'",2
"b'Background Increases in longevity will involve a significant increase among the number of drivers in the very old, who are at greater risk of being involved in road accidents. Data are thus needed from studies of older populations to characterize those still driving, the reasons for giving up and to help formulate appropriate policies for dealing with the problems faced and created by an increase in older drivers.\r\n\r\nMethods A driving questionnaire was administered to surviving members of a cohort comprising a representative sample of individuals aged >=84, the Cambridge City over 75 Cohort. Out of 546 survivors 404 completed the driving questionnaire at the 9-year follow-up. In addition, subjects were assessed, at baseline and at each follow-up, for cognitive performance using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and for physical impairment using the Instrumental of Activities in Daily Living (IADL) scale.\r\n\r\nResults Of the sample, 37% had driven in the past, and 8.4% were still driving, the majority regularly. The drivers tended to be younger (mean age 86.6 years), men (71%) and to be married (67.7%). Although physical disability and cognitive impairment are common in this age group, current drivers had few physical limitations on their daily activities and were not impaired on MMSE. None of the current drivers had visual impairment and 22.6% had hearing loss. Of those who had given up driving, 48.5% had given up at the age of >=80. The commonest reasons for giving up driving were health problems (28.6%), and loss of confidence (17.9%). One-third reported giving up driving on advice.\r\n\r\nConclusion A process of self-selection takes place among older drivers. People over the age of 84 who are still driving have generally high levels of physical fitness and mental functioning, although some have some sensory loss. Given the likely increase in the number of older drivers over the next decades, safety will be improved most by strategies aimed at the entire driving population with older drivers in mind, rather than relying on costly screening programmes to identify the relatively small numbers of impaired older people who continue to drive.'",3
"b""Recent imaging studies show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is activated during a wide variety of paradigms, including guessing tasks, simple delayed matching tasks and sentence completion. We suggest that, as with other regions of the prefrontal cortex, activity in the OFC is most likely to be observed when there is insufficient information available to determine the appropriate course of action. In these circumstances the OFC, rather than other prefrontal regions, is more likely to be activated when the problem of what to do next is best solved by taking into account the likely reward value of stimuli and responses, rather than their identity or location. We suggest that selection of stimuli on the basis of their familiarity and responses on the basis of a feeling of \x91rightness' are also examples of selection on the basis of reward value. Within the OFC, the lateral regions are more likely to be involved when the action selected requires the suppression of previously rewarded responses.\r\n\r\n""",1
"b'We have studied in vivo neo-galactosylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed the critical factors involved in this system. Two heterologous genes, gma12+ encoding [alpha]1,2-galactosyltransferase ([alpha]1,2 GalT) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and UGT2 encoding UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) transporter from human, were functionally expressed to examine the intracellular conditions required for galactosylation. Detection by fluorescence labeled [alpha]-galactose specific lectin revealed that 50% of the cells incorporated galactose to cell surface mannoproteins only when the gma12+ and hUGT2 genes were coexpressed in galactose media. Integration of both genes in the [Delta]mnn1 background cells increased galactosylation to 80% of the cells. Correlation between cell surface galactosylation and UDP-galactose transport activity indicated that an exogenous supply of UDP-Gal transporter rather than [alpha]1,2 GalT played a key role for efficient galactosylation in S.cerevisiae. In addition, this heterologous system enabled us to study the in vivo function of S.pombe [alpha]1,2 GalT to prove that it transfers galactose to both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. Structural analysis indicated that this enzyme transfers galactose to O-mannosyl residue attached to polypeptides and produces Gal[alpha]1,2-Man1-O-Ser/Thr structure. Thus, we have successfully generated a system for efficient galactose incorporation which is originally absent in S.cerevisiae, suggesting further possibilities for in vivo glycan remodeling toward therapeutically useful galactose containing heterologous proteins in S.cerevisiae.'",2
"b'Elevated ammonium concentrations in the medium of cultivated cells have been shown to increase the intracellular levels of uridine-5[prime]-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and uridine-5[prime]-diphospho-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc; Ryll et al., 1994). These sugar nucleotides are substrates for glycosyltransferases in the glycosylation pathway. In our experiments, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells producing an immunoadhesin glycoprotein (GP1-IgG) have been cultivated under controlled cell culture conditions in the presence of different ammonium concentrations. 15N-Labeled ammonium chloride (15NH4Cl) was added exogenously to the cell culture media to determine if ammonium was incorporated into UDP-GlcNAc and cytidine-5[prime]-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NANA) pools, and subsequently incorporated into GP1-IgG as N-linked glycans. The intracellular pools of UDP-activated hexosamines (UDP-GNAc) were followed during the time course of the experiment. To assess the extent of 15NH4+ incorporation into the glycans of GP1-IgG, the glycoprotein was first purified to homogeneity by protein A chromatography. Enzymatically released N-glycans were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. N-Glycans synthesized in the presence of 15NH4Cl revealed an N-glycan-dependent increase in mass-to-charge of 2.5-4.8 Da. These results indicate that 60-70% of the total nitrogen containing monosaccharides had incorporated 15N. Presumably, 15NH4+ was incorporated into GlcNAc and N-acetylneuraminic acid as proposed earlier (Ryll et al., 1994). This might be a universal and previously not described reaction in mammalian cells when exposed to nonphysiological but in cell culture commonly found concentrations of ammonium. The data presented here are of significance for glycoprotein production in mammalian cell culture, since it has been shown previously that elevated levels of UDP-activated hexosamines affect N-glycan characteristics such as branching and degree of amino sugar incorporation. In addition, our results demonstrate that isotope labeling in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS can be used as an alternate tool to radioactive labeling of sugar substrates in metabolic studies.'",2
"b'The organization of projections from V2 thin stripes and interstripes to V4 was investigated using a combination of physiological and anatomical techniques. The compartments of V2 were first characterized, in vivo, using optical recording of intrinsic signals. Multiple anterograde tracers were then injected into different V2 compartments. The distribution of labeled axons was analyzed in tangential or horizontal sections including V4. A small iontophoretic injection, either in a thin stripe or an interstripe, labeled a large primary and several secondary foci in V4. The primary foci from the thin stripe and interstripe were spatially segregated by a gap of ~1 mm. Furthermore, less dense regions within the primary foci were often \x91filled-in\x92 by secondary foci from the opposite V2 compartment. When two injections were made both at interstripes, their projections to V4 were almost entirely overlapping. These anatomical patterns indicate that segregation and convergence of intercortical pathways are both important features of V4 organization. Furthermore, the size of cortical modules increases considerably from the blobs of V1, through the stripes of V2, to the afferent domains of V4.\r\n\r\n'",1
"b""Using random peptide libraries we have previously shown that both mouse and rat class I molecules can exhibit different peptide length preferences. Such studies required expression of the particular class I molecules in RMA-S, a cell line deficient in the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). For another rat class I molecule called RT1-Au, however, we found that expression in RMA-S was poor and could not be increased sufficiently by incubation at 26\xb0C. To circumvent this problem we performed our studies on C58, a rat cell line that expresses RT1-Au naturally in the presence of a functional TAP transporter. Using C58 cells, cell-surface-expressed class I molecules were `stripped' of peptides and \xdf2-microglobulin by washing the cells with an acidic citrate buffer (pH 3.3). Peptide stabilization assays, assessed by FACS analysis, were then performed using either specific peptides or synthetic random peptide libraries of different lengths (7\x9615 amino acids), supplemented with recombinant rat \xdf2-microglobulin. As a positive control an RT1-Au-specific nonamer peptide was designed using the previously determined peptide binding motif and this was found to bind to RT1-Au at nanomolar concentrations. Both length preference and importance of free N- and C-termini were tested using free base, formylated and acetylated peptide libraries. Results showed that RT1-Au was not able to accommodate N- or C-terminally blocked peptides but displayed a preference for peptides of 9\x9612 amino acids, similar to the preference observed for the RT1-A1c allotype, the other rat TAP-B-associated molecule tested thus far. These results suggest that length preference remains a consideration to explain the allelic class I\x96TAP associations of the RT1-A region.""",4
"b""The advent of the new millennium prompted various discussions of the future of academic disciplines, including epidemiology and other public health sciences.1\x965 We missed this opportunity to make prognostications, but have chosen this first issue of 2001 for our initial editorial comment since, having succeeded Professor Peter Pharoah as editors of the International Journal of Epidemiology, this is the first issue which exclusively contains material which we have processed from the Bristol, UK, office. Of course Peter's remarkable record as editor of the IJE is difficult to follow, a fact reflected in the need for two of us to attempt to complete the tasks so admirably carried out by Peter alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough millennia are clear socio-cultural constructs, their expiry provides an excuse for making sweeping statements about the past and future which natural reticence would (and probably should) constrain at other times. However because such phenomena can be considered as socio-cultural constructs does not mean that they do not have real effects: the symbolic power of centennial or millennial transitions allow for changes in the way the world is viewed which have concrete effects. In the case of the latest millennial transition the coincidence of the calendar shift with the announcement of the sequencing of the human genome6,7 provides what we believe will be seen as a more than symbolic change in the way (wo)man views wo(man). There is much discussion in the lay and academic press which is clearly based on the notion that since 26 June 2000\x97the date sequencing of the human genome was announced\x97the world really has changed: new cures for cancer are coming soon; the selection of drugs and medical treatments will be tailored to the genome of the client; the development of chronic disease can be postponed by gene therapy; and the cause of all diseases will ultimately be revealed as genetic.\r\n\r\nViewed through DNA-tinted spectacles, is epidemiology a discipline with a glorious past, but decreasing relevance as description (epidemiological) is replaced by explanation (gene expression)? In 2001 would we be justified in advising a potential researcher committed to making a contribution to population health to enter epidemiology training rather than head straight for the nearest polymerase chain reaction console? As the official journal of the International Epidemiological Association the IJE cannot afford to skip this question\x97to which others would be keen to answer yes. The progenitor of one of the more remarkable (and influential) branches of late 20th century epidemiological research\x97the fetal origins of adult disease,8 which features as a theme subject in this issue of the IJE\x97thinks that improved understanding of the cause of coronary heart disease will come from animal experimentation, not epidemiology.9 What does that say to the rest of us who have made more modest contributions to our field? Taking stock of the past triumphs and tragedies of epidemiology may go some way to help provide an answer to our enthusiastic potential colleague considering a future in epidemiology.""",3
"b'CD8 T cells contain a distinct subset of CD8+CD28\x96 cells. These cells are not present at birth and their frequency increases with age. They frequently contain expanded clones using various TCR{alpha}\xdf receptors and these clones can represent >50% of all CD8 cells, specially in old subjects or patients with chronic viral infections such as HIV-1. Herein, it is shown that a large fraction of CD8+CD28\x96 cells expresses intracellular perforin by three-color flow cytometry, in particular when this subset is expanded. Together with their known ability to exert potent re-directed cytotoxicity, this indicates that CD8+CD28\x96 T cells comprise cytotoxic effector cells. With BrdU labeling, we show that CD8+CD28\x96 cells derive from CD8+CD28+ precursors in vitro. In addition, sorted CD8+CD28+ cells gave rise to a population of CD8+CD28\x96 cells after allo-stimulation. Moreover, ex vivo CD8+CD28+ cells contain the majority of CD8 blasts, supporting the notion that they contain the proliferative precursors of CD8+CD28\x96 cells. CD95 (Fas) expression was lower in CD8+CD28\x96 cells, and this subset was less prone to spontaneous apoptosis in ex vivo samples and more resistant to activation-induced cell death induced by a superantigen in vitro. Thus, the persistence of expanded clones in vivo in the CD8+CD28\x96 subset may be explained by antigen-driven differentiation from CD8+CD28+ memory precursors, with relative resistance to apoptosis as the clones become perforin+ effector cells.'",4
"b'Increased mucosal expression of TF, the Thomsen-Friedenreich oncofetal blood group antigen (galactose \xdf1-3 N-acetylgalactosamine {alpha}-) occurs in colon cancer and colitis. This allows binding of TF-specific lectins, such as peanut agglutinin (PNA), which is mitogenic to the colorectal epithelium. To identify the cell surface TF-expressing glycoprotein(s), HT29 and Caco2 colon cancer cells were surface-labeled with Na[125I] and subjected to PNA-agarose affinity purification and electrophoresis. Proteins, ~110\x96180 kDa, present in HT29 but not Caco2 were identified by Western blotting as high molecular weight splice variants of CD44 (CD44v). Selective removal of TF antigen by Streptococcus pneumoniae endo-{alpha}-N-acetylgalactosaminidase substantially reduced PNA binding to CD44v. Immunoprecipitated CD44v from HT29 cell extracts also expressed sialyl-Tn (sialyl 2-6 N-acetylgalactosamine{alpha}-). Incubation of PNA 15 \xb5g/ml with HT29 cells caused no additional proliferative effect in the presence of anti-CD44v6 mAb. In colon cancer tissue extracts (N = 3) PNA bound to CD44v but not to standard CD44. These data show that CD44v is a major PNA-binding glycoprotein in colon cancer cells. Because CD44 high molecular weight splice variants are present in colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease tissue but are absent from normal mucosa, these results may also explain the increased PNA reactivity in colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. The coexpression of oncofetal carbohydrate antigens TF and sialyl-Tn on CD44 splice variants provides a link between cancer-associated changes in glycosylation and CD44 splicing, both of which correlate with increased metastatic potential.'",2
"b""Background Tuberculosis (TB) is still amongst the most important causes of human morbidity and mortality, killing approximately two million people each year. Standard short-course chemotherapy (SSCC) can rapidly control illness and dramatically reduce the chance of death, but the impact of treatment has rarely been evaluated in these terms.\r\n\r\nMethod We developed a mathematical model that makes use of routinely-collected data to calculate the number of deaths directly prevented by TB treatment (i.e. excluding those due to reduced transmission). The method was applied to the world's largest TB control programme covering over 500 million people in 12 provinces of China.\r\n\r\nResults Counties which had been enrolled in the programme since 1991 were, by 1997, preventing at least 46% (37\x9656%) of the TB deaths that would otherwise have occurred. If replicated across the entire TB control programme area, this would amount to 30 000 (range 26 000\x9659 000) deaths directly prevented each year.\r\n\r\nConclusions Short-course chemotherapy has substantially reduced TB mortality in half of China. The analytical method described here could be applied to TB control operations in many other countries, and should help to quantify the true burden of tuberculosis alleviated by SSCC.""",3
