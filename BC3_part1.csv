17502104,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Plant caspase-like proteases in plant programmed cell death.,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically-controlled disassembly of the cell. In animal systems, the central core execution switch for apoptotic PCD is the activation of caspases (Cysteine-containing Aspartate-specific proteases). Accumulating evidence in recent years suggests the existence of caspase-like activity in plants and its functional involvement in various types of plant PCD, although no functional homologs of animal caspases were identified in plant genome. In this mini-review, we will cover the recent results on the existence of plant caspase-like proteases and introduce major technologies used in detecting the activation of caspase-like proteases during plant PCD."
17503969,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,"The ER body, a new organelle in Arabidopsis thaliana, requires NAI2 for its formation and accumulates specific beta-glucosidases.","Plants develop various ER-derived structures with specific functions. The ER body found in Arabidopsis thaliana is a spindle-shaped structure. ER bodies accumulate in epidermal cells in seedlings or are induced by wounding. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the ER body remained obscure. We isolated an ER body-deficient mutant in Arabidopsis seedlings, which we termed nai2. The NAI2 gene encodes a member of a unique protein family. NAI2 localizes to the ER body and the downregulation of NAI2 elongates ER bodies and reduces their number. ER bodies specifically accumulate high levels of PYK10/BGLU23, which is a beta-glucosidase that bears an ER retention signal. Additionally, in the nai2 mutant, PYK10 protein is diffuse throughout the ER and the PYK10 protein level is reduced. These observations indicate that NAI2 is a key factor for the formation of ER bodies and for the accumulation of PYK10 in the ER bodies of Arabidopsis. We also found that BGLU18, which encodes another beta-glucosidase with an ER retention signal, is induced at the site of wounding. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the BGLU18 protein is exclusively localized in ER bodies formed directly at the wounding site of cotyledons. These results suggest that BGLU18 is a component of the ER body in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis."
17505518,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Biomechanics of climbing palms and how they climb.,"Climbing plants have fascinated botanists since the pioneering works of Darwin and his contemporaries in the 19(th) century. Diverse plants have evolved different ways of climbing and a wide range of attachment devices and stem biomechanics to cope with the particular physical demands of life as a climber. We investigated the biomechanics of attachment in a range of climbing palms, including true rattans from Southeast Asia and the genus Desmoncus from South America. We found that hook strength and orientation is coordinated with rachis geometry and rigidity. These findings support the notion of a ratchet-type attachment mechanism and partly explain why these spiny plants are so catchy and efficient at attaching to supports."
17510629,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Intracellular Ca2+ stores could participate to abscisic acid-induced depolarization and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension, abscisic acid (ABA) induces changes in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) which are the trigger for ABA-induced plasma membrane anion current activation, H(+)-ATPase inhibition, and subsequent plasma membrane depolarization. In the present study, we took advantage of this model to analyze the implication of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in ABA signal transduction through electrophysiological current measurements, cytosolic Ca(2+) activity measurements with the apoaequorin Ca(2+) reporter protein and external pH measurement. Intracellular Ca(2+) stores involvement was determined by using specific inhibitors of CICR channels: the cADP-ribose/ryanodine receptor (Br-cADPR and dantrolene) and of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (U73122). In addition experiments were performed on epidermal strips of A. thaliana leaves to monitor stomatal closure in response to ABA in presence of the same pharmacology. Our data provide evidence that ryanodine receptor and inositol trisphosphate receptor could be involved in ABA-induced (1) Ca(2+) release in the cytosol, (2) anion channel activation and H(+)-ATPase inhibition leading to plasma membrane depolarization and (3) stomatal closure. Intracellular Ca(2+) release could thus contribute to the control of early events in the ABA signal transduction pathway in A. thaliana."
17511879,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Carbon and nitrogen nutrient balance signaling in plants.,"Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism must be tightly coordinated to sustain optimal growth and development for plants and other cellular organisms. Furthermore, C/N balance is also critical for the ecosystem response to elevated atmospheric CO(2). Despite numerous physiological and molecular studies in C/N balance or ratio response, very few genes have been shown to play important roles in C/N balance signaling. During recent five years, exciting progress was made through genetic and genomic studies. Several DNA microarray studies have shown that more than half of the transcriptome is regulated by C, N and the C-N combination. Three genetic studies involving distinct bioassays have demonstrated that a putative nitrate transporter (NTR2.1), a putative glutamate receptor (GLR1.1) and a putative methyltransferase (OSU1) have important functions in the C/N balance response. OSU1 is identical to QUA2/TSD2 which has been implicated to act in cell wall biogenesis, indicating a link between cell wall property and the C/N balance signaling. Given that many investigations are only focused on C alone or N alone, the C/N balance bioassays and gene expression patterns are discussed to assist phenotypic characterization of C/N balance signaling. Further, re-examination of those previously reported sugar or nitrogen responsive genes in C/N balance response may be necessary to dissect the C/N signaling pathways. In addition, key components involved in C-N interactions in bacterial, yeast and animal systems and whether they are functionally conserved in plants are discussed. These rapid advances have provided the first important step towards the construction of the complex yet elegant C/N balance signaling networks in plants."
17513499,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Floral initiation process at the soybean shoot apical meristem may involve multiple hormonal pathways.,"Flowering and seed set underpin most of the agriculture production. In the 57 Issue of The Plant Journal, we analysed the gene expression changes in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) during the transition from vegetative to flowering phase in soybean, an important legume crop. We identified a number of genes that are actively transcribed or repressed during the transition to flowering and the annotation of which have allowed us to infer the involvement of at least three hormonal pathways: those that involve abscisic acid (ABA), auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) in the regulation of floral initiation process in soybean. Intriguingly, the induction of known floral homeiotic transcript that includes APETALA1 in the SAM occurred after the induction of these hormonal transcripts adding a likely novel biochemical dimension to the current understanding of floral regulatory pathways. In view of recent studies, a cross-regulatory mechanism involving these hormones is proposed to operate at the SAM to initiate flowering."
17513757,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Callose synthesis in higher plants.,"Callose is a polysaccharide in the form of beta-1,3-glucan with some beta-1,6-branches and it exists in the cell walls of a wide variety of higher plants. Callose plays important roles during a variety of processes in plant development and/or in response to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. It is now generally believed that callose is produced by callose synthases and that it is degraded by beta-1,3-glucanases. Despite the importance of callose in plants, we have only recently begun to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its synthesis. Molecular and genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified a set of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of callose. In this mini-review, we highlight recent progress in understanding callose biosynthesis and degradation and discuss the future challenges of unraveling the mechanism(s) by which callose synthase operate."
17517622,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Assessing fungal root colonization for plant improvement.,"Fungal endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. Current studies on their biology, diversity and benefits are unravelling their high relevance on plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Implementation of such properties may open new perspectives in agriculture and forestry. We aim to exploit the endophytic capacities of the fungal species Fusarium equiseti, a naturally occurring root endophyte which has shown antagonism to plant pathogens, and Pochonia chlamydosporia, a nematophagous fungus with putative endophytic behavior, for plant protection and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. A real-time PCR protocol for quantification of the fungal population, together with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation with the GFP gene for confocal microscopy analyses, were designed and applied to assess endophytic development of both these fungal species. Although quantification of both F. equiseti and P. chlamydosporia yielded similar degrees of root colonization, microscopical observations demonstrated differences in infection and development patterns. Furthermore, we found evidences of plant response against endophyte colonization, supporting a balanced antagonism between the endophyte virulence and the plant defenses. Optimization and application of the methodologies presented herein will allow elucidation of beneficial interactions among these endophytes and their host plants."
17518518,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2009,Isolation of high salinity stress tolerant genes from Pisum sativum by random overexpression in Escherichia coli and their functional validation.,"Salinity stress is one of the major factors which reduce crop plants growth and productivity resulting in significant economic losses worldwide. Therefore, it would be fruitful to isolate and functionally identify new salinity stress-induced genes for understanding the mechanism and developing salinity stress tolerant plants. Based on functional gene screening assay, we have isolated few salinity tolerant genes out of one million Escherichia coli (SOLR) transformants containing pea cDNAs. Sequence analysis of three of these genes revealed homology to Ribosomal-L30E (RPL30E), Chlorophyll-a/b-binding protein (Chla/bBP) and FIDDLEHEAD (FDH). The salinity tolerance of these genes in bacteria was further confirmed by using another strain of E. coli (DH5alpha) transformants. The homology based computational modeling of these proteins suggested the high degree of conservation with the conserved domains of their homologous partners. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of these cDNAs (except the FDH) was upregulated in pea plants in response to NaCl stress. We observed that there was no significant effect of Li(+) ion on the expression level of these genes, while an increase in response to K(+) ion was observed. Overall, this study provides an evidence for a novel function of these genes in high salinity stress tolerance. The PsFDH showed constitutive expression in planta suggesting that it can be used as constitutively expressed marker gene for salinity stress tolerance in plants. This study brings new direction in identifying novel function of unidentified genes in abiotic stress tolerance without previous knowledge of the genome sequence."
17521633,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Identification of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Drosophila involved in RNAi and transposon suppression.,"Here, we show that recombinant Drosophila elp1 (D-elp1) produced in Sf9 cells or Escherichia coli, corresponding to the largest of the three subunits in the RNA polymerase II core elongator complex, has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. D-elp1 is a noncanonical RdRP that can synthesize dsRNA from different ssRNA templates using either a primer-dependent or primer-independent initiation mechanism. Of the three core subunits, only D-elp1 depletion inhibits RNAi in S2 cells but does not affect micro RNA function. Furthermore, D-elp1 depletion results in increased steady state levels of representative transposon RNAs and a decrease in the corresponding transposon antisense transcripts and endo siRNAs. In contrast, although Dcr-2 depletion results in increased transposon RNA levels and a reduction in the corresponding endo siRNAs, there is no change in the transposon antisense RNA levels. In D-elp1 null third instar larvae transposon RNA levels are also increased and the corresponding transposon antisense RNAs are reduced. D-elp1 associates tightly with Dcr-2, similar to the Dicer-RdRP interaction observed in lower eukaryotes. These results identify an aspect of the RNAi pathway in Drosophila that suggest transposon derived endo siRNAs, critical for transposon suppression, are produced, in part, in a D-elp1 dependent step that converts transposon RNA into dsRNA that is subsequently processed by Dcr-2. The generality of this mechanism in genome defense and RNA silencing in higher eukaryotes is suggested."
17525332,1,Ann. Neurol.,7707449,2009,Human neural stem cells ameliorate autoimmune encephalomyelitis in non-human primates.,"OBJECTIVE: Transplanted neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) display peculiar therapeutic plasticity in vivo. Although the replacement of cells was first expected as the prime therapeutic mechanism of stem cells in regenerative medicine, it is now clear that transplanted NPCs simultaneously instruct several therapeutic mechanisms, among which replacement of cells might not necessarily prevail. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) by which NPCs exert their therapeutic plasticity is lacking. This study was designed as a preclinical approach to test the feasibility of human NPC transplantation in an outbreed nonhuman primate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model approximating the clinical and complex neuropathological situation of human multiple sclerosis (MS) more closely than EAE in the standard laboratory rodent. METHODS: We examined the safety and efficacy of the intravenous (IV) and intrathecal (IT) administration of human NPCs in common marmosets affected by human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 1-125-induced EAE. Treatment commenced upon the occurrence of detectable brain lesions on a 4.7T spectrometer. RESULTS: EAE marmosets injected IV or IT with NPCs accumulated lower disability and displayed increased survival, as compared with sham-treated controls. Transplanted NPCs persisted within the host central nervous system (CNS), but were also found in draining lymph nodes, for up to 3 months after transplantation and exhibited remarkable immune regulatory capacity in vitro. INTERPRETATION: Herein, we provide the first evidence that human CNS stem cells ameliorate EAE in nonhuman primates without overt side effects. Immune regulation (rather than neural differentiation) is suggested as the major putative mechanism by which NPCs ameliorate EAE in vivo. Our findings represent a critical step toward the clinical use of human NPCs in MS."
17525340,1,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2009,Dynamic interpretation of hedgehog signaling in the Drosophila wing disc.,"Morphogens are classically defined as molecules that control patterning by acting at a distance to regulate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, secreted Hedgehog (Hh) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. Although the prevailing view is that Hh functions in the Drosophila wing disc as a classical morphogen, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and Hh concentration thresholds has not been demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and propose that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, we predict that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial &quot;overshoot&quot; of the Hh gradient occurs, i.e., a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. Through a temporal examination of Hh target gene expression, we observe that the patterns initially expand anteriorly and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for the overshoot. The Hh gene network architecture suggests this overshoot results from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched (Ptc). In fact, when the network structure was altered such that the ptc gene is no longer up-regulated in response to Hh-signaling activation, we found that the patterns of gene expression, which have distinct borders in wild-type discs, now overlap. Our results support a model in which Hh gradient dynamics, resulting from Ptc up-regulation, play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression."
17525731,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,A novel system for the launch of alphavirus RNA synthesis reveals a role for the Imd pathway in arthropod antiviral response.,"Alphaviruses are RNA viruses transmitted between vertebrate hosts by arthropod vectors, primarily mosquitoes. How arthropods counteract alphaviruses or viruses per se is not very well understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model system for studying innate immunity against bacterial and fungal infections. In this study we report the use of a novel system to analyze replication of Sindbis virus (type species of the alphavirus genus) RNA following expression of a Sindbis virus replicon RNA from the fly genome. We demonstrate deficits in the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway enhance viral replication while mutations in the Toll pathway fail to affect replication. Similar results were observed with intrathoracic injections of whole virus and confirmed in cultured mosquito cells. These findings show that the Imd pathway mediates an antiviral response to Sindbis virus replication. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an antiviral role for the Imd pathway in insects."
17525732,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,Nucleolar proteins suppress Caenorhabditis elegans innate immunity by inhibiting p53/CEP-1.,"The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in multiple functions that play key roles in health and disease, including ribosome biogenesis, control of aging, and cell cycle regulation. A genetic screen for negative regulators of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans led to the identification of a mutation in NOL-6, a nucleolar RNA-associated protein (NRAP), which is involved in ribosome biogenesis and conserved across eukaryotic organisms. Mutation or silencing of NOL-6 and other nucleolar proteins results in an enhanced resistance to bacterial infections. A full-genome microarray analysis on animals with altered immune function due to mutation in nol-6 shows increased transcriptional levels of genes regulated by a p53 homologue, CEP-1. Further studies indicate that the activation of innate immunity by inhibition of nucleolar proteins requires p53/CEP-1 and its transcriptional target SYM-1. Since nucleoli and p53/CEP-1 are conserved, our results reveal an ancient immune mechanism by which the nucleolus may regulate immune responses against bacterial pathogens."
17525734,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Noise management by molecular networks.,"Fluctuations in the copy number of key regulatory macromolecules (&quot;noise&quot;) may cause physiological heterogeneity in populations of (isogenic) cells. The kinetics of processes and their wiring in molecular networks can modulate this molecular noise. Here we present a theoretical framework to study the principles of noise management by the molecular networks in living cells. The theory makes use of the natural, hierarchical organization of those networks and makes their noise management more understandable in terms of network structure. Principles governing noise management by ultrasensitive systems, signaling cascades, gene networks and feedback circuitry are discovered using this approach. For a few frequently occurring network motifs we show how they manage noise. We derive simple and intuitive equations for noise in molecule copy numbers as a determinant of physiological heterogeneity. We show how noise levels and signal sensitivity can be set independently in molecular networks, but often changes in signal sensitivity affect noise propagation. Using theory and simulations, we show that negative feedback can both enhance and reduce noise. We identify a trade-off; noise reduction in one molecular intermediate by negative feedback is at the expense of increased noise in the levels of other molecules along the feedback loop. The reactants of the processes that are strongly (cooperatively) regulated, so as to allow for negative feedback with a high strength, will display enhanced noise."
17525735,1,Nature,410462,2009,Beyond the myth of the supernova-remnant origin of cosmic rays.,"The origin of Galactic cosmic-ray ions has remained an enigma for almost a century. Although it has generally been thought that they are accelerated in the shock waves associated with powerful supernova explosions-for which there have been recent claims of evidence-the mystery is far from resolved. In fact, we may be on the wrong track altogether in looking for isolated regions of cosmic-ray acceleration."
17535111,1,Ann. Neurol.,7707449,2009,A neural network critical for spelling.,"We aimed to identify neuroanatomical regions associated with deficits to the graphemic buffer, a working memory component of the spelling system that holds the sequence of letter identities during production. We evaluated 331 patients with left hemisphere ischemic stroke with various spelling tests and magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging, within 48 hours of stroke onset. A voxel-wise statistical map showed that ischemia in voxels in posterior and inferior frontal and parietal cortex, subcortical white matter underlying prefrontal cortex, lateral occipital gyrus, or caudate was associated with impairment in maintaining the sequence of letter identities while spelling."
17535800,1,Ann. Neurol.,7707449,2009,Pivotal studies of orphan drugs approved for neurological diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify design elements of clinical trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of drugs for neurological diseases with and without orphan indications. METHODS: We used publicly available information to identify approvals for drugs for neurological diseases with an orphan indication (n = 19) and compared them with recent approvals for drugs for neurological diseases without an orphan indication (n = 20). We identified &quot;pivotal trials&quot; from drug labels and drug approval packages, and assessed them on four elements of clinical trial design: control, blinding, randomization, and size. RESULTS: All drugs for neurological diseases (100%) approved without an orphan indication included at least two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In comparison, 32% of drugs with an orphan indication had at least two such trials (p &lt; 0.001) and 74% had at least one (p = 0.02). Thirty-three pivotal trials were conducted for the 19 drugs approved with an orphan indication. Of the 33 trials, 11 (33%) did not use a placebo control, 9 (27%) were not double blind, and 4 (12%) were not randomized. Drugs approved without an orphan indication had more pivotal trials per drug (3.8 vs 1.7 trials; p &lt; 0.001) and a larger mean trial size (506 vs 164 trial participants; p &lt; 0.001). INTERPRETATION: The US Food and Drug Administration has approved orphan drugs for neurological diseases without randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials. As orphan drug development grows, demand will likely increase for alternative designs for conducting adequate and well-controlled studies to demonstrate drug efficacy."
17535810,1,Ann. Neurol.,7707449,2009,Digit-specific aberrations in the primary somatosensory cortex in Writer's cramp.,"OBJECTIVE: One approach to the treatment of focal hand dystonia (FHD) is via sensory-based training regimes. It is known that FHD patients demonstrate a reduced distance between the representations of digits 1 and 5 and also digits 2 and 5 in primary somatosensory cortex. However, we lack information on the spatial relationships among digits, such as reduced inter-digit spacing or shifts of representations within the cortical areas, and whether aberrations are specific to symptomatic digits. Our aim was to characterize the spatial relationships among individual digits to determine the types of aberrations that exist and whether these are specific to symptomatic digits only. METHODS: Using high-resolution fMRI over a limited volume and surface-based mapping techniques, the cortical representations of all digits of the dystonia-affected hand within the sub-regions of the postcentral gyrus were mapped in patients with task-specific Writer's cramp (WC). RESULTS: In area 3b, digits directly involved in writing (D1, D2 and D3) show reduced inter-digit separation, reversals, and overlapping activation. The thumb representation occupies territory normally occupied by digit 2 in controls. Asymptomatic digits 4 and 5 preserve their inter-digit separation yet shift towards the D1/D2/D3 cluster, suggesting that reduced spacing, not simply digit shifts, are associated with dystonia symptoms. Area 3a was less responsive to sensory input in WC patients providing evidence of reduced afferent drive or top-down modulation to this sub-region. INTERPRETATION: Therapeutic regimes aimed at facilitating inter-digit separation of digits 1, 2 and 3 may promote beneficial plasticity in WC patients."
17535814,1,Int. J. Biol. Sci.,101235568,2009,Disruption of the BMEI0066 gene attenuates the virulence of Brucella melitensis and decreases its stress tolerance.,"Brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen. An operon composed of BMEI0066, which encodes a two-component response regulator CenR, and BMEI0067, which encodes a cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit, has been predicted to exist in many bacterial species. However, little is known about the function of this operon. In order to characterize this operon and assess its role in virulence, we constructed a marked deletion mutant of BMEI0066. The mutant was less able to withstand hyperosmotic conditions than wild-type (16M), but showed no significant difference with 16M when challenged by H(2)O(2). The mutant also showed increased sensitivity to elevated temperature (42 degrees C) and a reduced survival ratio under acidic conditions compared with 16M. The mutant failed to replicate in cultured murine macrophages and was rapidly cleared from the spleens of experimentally infected BALB/c mice. These findings suggest that these operon products make an important contribution to pathogenesis in mice, probably by allowing B. melitensis to adapt to the harsh environment encountered within host macrophages."
17537733,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,The STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES 5/6 complex promotes sister chromatid alignment and homologous recombination after DNA damage in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Sister chromatids are often arranged as incompletely aligned entities in interphase nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana. The STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES (SMC) 5/6 complex, together with cohesin, is involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair by sister chromatid recombination in yeasts and mammals. Here, we analyzed the function of genes in Arabidopsis. The wild-type allele of SMC5 is essential for seed development. Each of the two SMC6 homologs of Arabidopsis is required for efficient repair of DNA breakage via intermolecular homologous recombination in somatic cells. Alignment of sister chromatids is enhanced transiently after X-irradiation (and mitomycin C treatment) in wild-type nuclei. In the smc5/6 mutants, the x-ray-mediated increase in sister chromatid alignment is much lower and delayed. The reduced S phase-established cohesion caused by a knockout mutation in one of the alpha-kleisin genes, SYN1, also perturbed enhancement of sister chromatid alignment after irradiation, suggesting that the S phase-established cohesion is a prerequisite for correct DSB-dependent cohesion. The radiation-sensitive51 mutant, deficient in heteroduplex formation during DSB repair, showed wild-type frequencies of sister chromatid alignment after X-irradiation, implying that the irradiation-mediated increase in sister chromatid alignment is a prerequisite for, rather than a consequence of, DNA strand exchange between sister chromatids. Our results suggest that the SMC5/6 complex promotes sister chromatid cohesion after DNA breakage and facilitates homologous recombination between sister chromatids."
17538026,1,BioTechniques,8306785,2009,A new outlier removal approach for cDNA microarray normalization.,"Normalization is a critical step in the analysis of microarray gene expression data. For dual-labeled array, traditional normalization methods assume that the majority of genes are non-differentially expressed and that the number of overexpressed genes approximately equals the number of under-expressed genes. However, these assumptions are inappropriate in some particular conditions. Differentially expressed genes have a negative impact on normalization and are regarded as outliers in statistics. We propose a new outlier removal-based normalization method. Simulated and real data sets were analyzed, and our results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the precision of normalization by eliminating the impact of outliers, and efficiently identify candidates for differential expression."
17541403,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,The variant rs1867277 in FOXE1 gene confers thyroid cancer susceptibility through the recruitment of USF1/USF2 transcription factors.,"In order to identify genetic factors related to thyroid cancer susceptibility, we adopted a candidate gene approach. We studied tag- and putative functional SNPs in genes involved in thyroid cell differentiation and proliferation, and in genes found to be differentially expressed in thyroid carcinoma. A total of 768 SNPs in 97 genes were genotyped in a Spanish series of 615 cases and 525 controls, the former comprising the largest collection of patients with this pathology from a single population studied to date. SNPs in an LD block spanning the entire FOXE1 gene showed the strongest evidence of association with papillary thyroid carcinoma susceptibility. This association was validated in a second stage of the study that included an independent Italian series of 482 patients and 532 controls. The strongest association results were observed for rs1867277 (OR[per-allele] = 1.49; 95%CI = 1.30-1.70; P = 5.9x10(-9)). Functional assays of rs1867277 (NM_004473.3:c.-283G&gt;A) within the FOXE1 5' UTR suggested that this variant affects FOXE1 transcription. DNA-binding assays demonstrated that, exclusively, the sequence containing the A allele recruited the USF1/USF2 transcription factors, while both alleles formed a complex in which DREAM/CREB/alphaCREM participated. Transfection studies showed an allele-dependent transcriptional regulation of FOXE1. We propose a FOXE1 regulation model dependent on the rs1867277 genotype, indicating that this SNP is a causal variant in thyroid cancer susceptibility. Our results constitute the first functional explanation for an association identified by a GWAS and thereby elucidate a mechanism of thyroid cancer susceptibility. They also attest to the efficacy of candidate gene approaches in the GWAS era."
17541406,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,Evidence for different pathways during horizontal gene transfer in competent Bacillus subtilis cells.,"Cytological and genetic evidence suggests that the Bacillus subtilis DNA uptake machinery localizes at a single cell pole and takes up single-stranded (ss) DNA. The integration of homologous donor DNA into the recipient chromosome requires RecA, while plasmid establishment, which is independent of RecA, requires at least RecO and RecU. RecA and RecN colocalize at the polar DNA uptake machinery, from which RecA forms filamentous structures, termed threads, in the presence of chromosomal DNA. We show that the transformation of chromosomal and of plasmid DNA follows distinct pathways. In the absence of DNA, RecU accumulated at a single cell pole in competent cells, dependent on RecA. Upon addition of any kind of DNA, RecA formed highly dynamic thread structures, which rapidly grew and shrank, and RecU dissipated from the pole. RecO visibly accumulated at the cell pole only upon addition of plasmid DNA, and, to a lesser degree, of phage DNA, but not of chromosomal DNA. RecO accumulation was weakly influenced by RecN, but not by RecA. RecO annealed ssDNA complexed with SsbA in vitro, independent of any nucleotide cofactor. The DNA end-joining Ku protein was also found to play a role in viral and plasmid transformation. On the other hand, transfection with SPP1 phage DNA required functions from both chromosomal and plasmid transformation pathways. The findings show that competent bacterial cells possess a dynamic DNA recombination machinery that responds in a differential manner depending if entering DNA shows homology with recipient DNA or has self-annealing potential. Transformation with chromosomal DNA only requires RecA, which forms dynamic filamentous structures that may mediate homology search and DNA strand invasion. Establishment of circular plasmid DNA requires accumulation of RecO at the competence pole, most likely mediating single-strand annealing, and RecU, which possibly down-regulates RecA. Transfection with SPP1 viral DNA follows an intermediate route that contains functions from both chromosomal and plasmid transformation pathways."
17541407,1,J. Clin. Invest.,7802877,2009,Cyclin I activates Cdk5 and regulates expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in postmitotic mouse cells.,"Cyclin I is an atypical cyclin because it is most abundant in postmitotic cells. We previously showed that cyclin I does not regulate proliferation, but rather controls survival of podocytes, terminally differentiated epithelial cells that are essential for the structural and functional integrity of kidney glomeruli. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which cyclin I safeguards against apoptosis and found that cyclin I bound and activated cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in isolated mouse podocytes and neurons. Cdk5 activity was reduced in glomeruli and brain lysates from cyclin I-deficient mice, and inhibition of Cdk5 increased in vitro the susceptibility to apoptosis in response to cellular damage. In addition, levels of the prosurvival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were reduced in podocytes and neurons from cyclin I-deficient mice, and restoration of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL expression prevented injury-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were decreased in cyclin I-deficient podocytes and that inhibition of MEK1/2 restored Bcl2 and Bcl-XL protein levels. Of interest, this pathway was also defective in mice with experimental glomerulonephritis. Taken together, these data suggest that a cyclin I-Cdk5 complex forms a critical antiapoptotic factor in terminally differentiated cells that functions via MAPK signaling to modulate levels of the prosurvival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL."
17541408,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Simplified yet highly accurate enzyme kinetics for cases of low substrate concentrations.,"Much of enzyme kinetics builds on simplifications enabled by the quasi-steady-state approximation and is highly useful when the concentration of the enzyme is much lower than that of its substrate. However, in vivo, this condition is often violated. In the present study, we show that, under conditions of realistic yet high enzyme concentrations, the quasi-steady-state approximation may readily be off by more than a factor of four when predicting concentrations. We then present a novel extension of the quasi-steady-state approximation based on the zero-derivative principle, which requires considerably less theoretical work than did previous such extensions. We show that the first-order zero-derivative principle, already describes much more accurately the true enzyme dynamics at enzyme concentrations close to the concentration of their substrates. This should be particularly relevant for enzyme kinetics where the substrate is an enzyme, such as in phosphorelay and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We illustrate this for the important example of the phosphotransferase system involved in glucose uptake, metabolism and signaling. We find that this system, with a potential complexity of nine dimensions, can be understood accurately using the first-order zero-derivative principle in terms of the behavior of a single variable with all other concentrations constrained to follow that behavior."

Tight control is essential as loss of organisation may result in the inappropriate formation of thrombi (thrombosis) or excessive bleeding. In this paper we describe the comparative analysis of resting and thrombin-stimulated platelet membrane proteomes and associated proteins to identify proteins important to platelet function. Surface proteins were labelled using a biotin tag and isolated by NeurtrAvidin affinity chromatography. Liquid phase IEF and SDS-PAGE were used to separate proteins, and bands of increased intensity in the stimulated platelet fractions were digested and identified by FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Novel proteins were identified along with proteins known to be translocated to the platelet surface. Furthermore, many platelet proteins revealed changes in location associated with function, including G6B and Hip-55. HIP-55 is an SH3-binding protein important in T-cell receptor signalling. Further analysis of HIP-55 revealed that this adaptor protein becomes increasingly associated with both Syk and integrin beta3 upon platelet activation. Analysis of HIP-55 deficient platelets revealed reduced fibrinogen binding upon thrombin stimulation, suggesting HIP-55 to be an important regulator of platelet function."
17545996,1,Acta Biochim. Pol.,14520300R,2009,"Impact of roscovitine, a selective CDK inhibitor, on cancer cells: bi-functionality increases its therapeutic potential.","Increased expression and activity of proteins driving cell cycle progression as well as inactivation of endogenous inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) enhance the proliferative potential of cells. Escape of cells during malignant transformation from the proper cell cycle control rendering them independent from growth factors provides rationale for therapeutic targeting of CDKs. Exposure of rapidly growing human MCF-7 breast cancer and HeLa cervix cancer cells to roscovitine (ROSC), a selective inhibitor of CDKs, inhibits their proliferation by induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. The outcome strongly depends on the intrinsic traits of the tumor cells, on their cell cycle status prior to the onset of treatment and also on ROSC concentration. At lower dose ROSC primarily inhibits the cell cycle-related CDKs resulting in a strong cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, ROSC arrests asynchronously growing cells at the G(2)/M transition irrespective of the status of their restriction checkpoint. However, the exposure of cancer cells synchronized after serum starvation in the late G(1) phase results in a transient G(1) arrest only in cells displaying the intact G(1)/S checkpoint. At higher dosage ROSC triggers apoptosis. In HeLa cells inhibition of the activity of CDK7 and, in consequence, that of RNA polymerase II is a major event that facilitates the initiation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, in the caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells ROSC induces apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway. HIPK2-mediated activation of the p53 transcription factor by phosphorylation at Ser46 results in upregulation of p53AIP1 protein. This protein after de novo synthesis and translocation into the mitochondria promotes depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane."

17550895,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,SIP30 is regulated by ERK in peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.,"ERK plays an important role in chronic neuropathic pain. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that in chronic constriction injury-treated rat spinal cords, up-regulation of SIP30 (SNAP25-interacting protein 30), which is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, correlates with ERK activation and that the up-regulation of SIP30 is suppressed by intrathecal delivery of the MEK inhibitor U0126. In PC12 cells, up-regulation of SIP30 by nerve growth factor is also dependent on ERK activation. We found that there is an ERK-responsive region in the rat sip30 promoter. Activation of ERK promotes the recruitment of the transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein to the sip30 gene promoter. Taken together, our results provide a potential downstream target of ERK activation-mediated neuropathic pain."
17553790,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Correlating gene and protein expression data using Correlated Factor Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Joint analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data taken from the same samples has the potential to elucidate complex biological mechanisms. Most current methods that integrate these datasets allow for the computation of the correlation between a gene and protein but only after a one-to-one matching of genes and proteins is done. However, genes and proteins are connected via biological pathways and their relationship is not necessarily one-to-one. In this paper, we investigate the use of Correlated Factor Analysis (CFA) for modeling the correlation of genome-scale gene and protein data. Unlike existing approaches, CFA considers all possible gene-protein pairs and utilizes all gene and protein information in its modeling framework. The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (gSVD) is another method which takes into account all available transcriptomic and proteomic data. Comparison is made between CFA and gSVD. RESULTS: Our simulation study indicates that the CFA estimates can consistently capture the dominant patterns of correlation between two sets of measurements; in contrast, the gSVD estimates cannot do that. Applied to real cancer data, the list of co-regulated genes and proteins identified by CFA has biologically meaningful interpretation, where both the gene and protein expressions are pointing to the same processes. Among the GO terms for which the genes and proteins are most correlated, we observed blood vessel morphogenesis and development. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that CFA is a useful tool for gene-protein data integration and modeling, where the main question is in finding which patterns of gene expression are most correlated with protein expression."

Besides the usual fcc phase of Ag, the heteronanostructures also contain a rare hcp (4H polytypic) phase, which favors asymmetrical growth. The rod-needle heteronanostructures (RNHSs) and plate-belt heteronanostructures (PBHSs) are formed through two different mechanisms. For RNHSs, the 4H and fcc phases coexist but have different densities in different segments, while for PBHSs, the fcc and 4H crystal structures exist in plate and belt segments, respectively. Condition-sensitive coexisting phase preferences can be applied as a new way of controlling the shape and thus the properties of Ag nanostructures."

Their steady-state absorption and emission spectra (in solution and in the solid state) and nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence decays (in solution) were recorded and assigned to the six possible trans chemical forms of the emitter and its anions. The spectra of the pure emitter were compared to its bioluminescence and fluorescence spectra when it is complexed with luciferase from the Japanese firefly (Luciola cruciata) and interpreted in terms of the intermolecular interactions based on the structure of the emitter in the luciferase active site. The wavelengths of the emission spectral maxima of the six chemical forms of OxyLH(2) are generally in good agreement with the theoretically predicted energies of the S(0)-S(1) transitions and range from the blue to the red regions, while the respective absorption maxima range from the ultraviolet to the green regions. It was confirmed that both neutral forms, phenol-enol and phenol-keto, are blue emitters, whereas the phenolate-enol form is yellow-green emitter. The phenol-enolate form, which probably only exists as a mixture with other species, and the phenolate-enolate dianion are yellow or orange emitters with close position of their emission bands. The phenolate-keto form always emits in the red region. The concentration ratio of the different chemical species in solutions of OxyLH(2) is determined by several factors which affect the intricate triple chemical equilibrium, most notably the pH, solvent polarity, hydrogen bonding, presence of additional ions, and pi-pi stacking. Due to the stabilization of the enol group of the 4-hydroxythiazole ring by hydrogen bonding to the proximate adenosine monophosphate, which according to the density functional calculations is similar to that due to the dimerization of two enol molecules observed in the crystal, the phenolate ion of the enol tautomer, which is the predominant ground-state species within the narrow pH interval 7.44-8.14 in buffered aqueous solutions, is the most probable emitter of the yellow-green bioluminescence common for most wild-type luciferases. This conclusion is supported by the bioluminescence/fluorescence spectra and the NMR data, as well the crystal structures of OxyLH(2) and MOxyLH(2), where the conjugated acid (phenol) of the emitter exists as pure enol tautomer."

This one-step method is general and was applied for the synthesis of other silyl radicals. Upon irradiation radical 1 (yellow solution in hexane) decays to yield the corresponding disproportionation products, silane and disilene (blue colored). In contrast, radical 2 is photostable in the absence of additives, but it abstracts hydrogen from triethylsilane and 2-propanol upon irradiation.

Then you find the first dimension gives poor resolution of samples rich in membrane-bound proteins. A relatively new modification of the classic standard IPG method for analysis of membrane-bound proteins is &quot;Blue Native&quot; gel electrophoresis. BN-PAGE incorporates a dye such as Coomassie Blue G-250 into membrane complexes to give them an electrophoretic mobility roughly proportional to their size. Conventionally SDS-PAGE is used for a second dimension. Wessels et al. instead used in-gel digestion followed by LCMS/MS for a higher resolution second dimension. The modified method gave faster identification of overlapping proteins and was able to detect assembly intermediates and transient interactions.. MAKING SENSE OF SENESCENCE: pp. 4241-4253The ripening (senescence) of fruit is one of the final steps in the life cycle of a plant. It is also the step that makes many edible fruits palatable or sweet and so is of economic significance as well. Since ripening is an oxidative step, Qin et al. examine the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the proteome of apple mitochondria. Accelerating senescence by exposure to 100% oxygen led to under-expression of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an enzyme characteristic of mitochondrial membranes and primary scavenger of free radicals. In addition to previously recognized enzymes, two new spots of unknown function were identified that will require further study. High oxygen also increased the frequency of carbonylation of selected proteins. Reducing the oxygen to 2% markedly reduced the rate of senescence and decreased the number of proteins up- or down-regulated. PLECKSTRIN, PLECKSTRIN, WHEREFORE ART THOU?: pp. 4254-4258It may not be quite as romantic as Juliet awaiting Romeo, but pleckstrin is rather shy about holding hands in public. Platelets lacking pleckstrin do not aggregate, secrete granules or polymerize actin, yet no direct signals between pleckstrin and actin have been seen. Pleckstrin is the major target of protein kinase C (PKC) in platelets and many platelet stimuli correlate with phosphorylation. Baig et al. set off to find out how the secret messages were being passed. They used recombinant and pseudo-phosphorylated pleckstrin, immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown assays, PKC-activated and PKC-inhibited platelets, and quad-TOF MS. Several unusual protein associations were found but no direct association with actin. The authors propose an indirect link between actin and pleckstrin (mediated by Juliet's maid), possibly through a-actinin, factor XIIIA, moesin, radixin, or 17-b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 4."

Here, we report the crystal structure of the Q188L mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP) photosensory core module, which exhibits altered photoconversion behavior and different crystal packing from wild type. We observe two distinct chromophore conformations in the Q188L crystal structure that we identify with the Pfr and Pr states. The Pr/Pfr compositions, varying from crystal to crystal, seem to correlate with light conditions under which the Q188L crystals are cryoprotected. We also compare all known Pr and Pfr structures. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identify residues that are involved in stabilizing the 15Ea (Pfr) and 15Za (Pr) configurations of the biliverdin chromophore. Specifically, Ser-261 appears to be essential to form a stable Pr state in PaBphP, possibly by means of its interaction with the propionate group of ring C. We propose a &quot;flip-and-rotate&quot; model that summarizes the major conformational differences between the Pr and Pfr states of the chromophore and its binding pocket."

The cellular and molecular defects that cause the disease remain unknown. Pluripotent cells generated from patients with T1D would be useful for disease modeling. We show here that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from patients with T1D by reprogramming their adult fibroblasts with three transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4). T1D-specific iPS cells, termed DiPS cells, have the hallmarks of pluripotency and can be differentiated into insulin-producing cells. These results are a step toward using DiPS cells in T1D disease modeling, as well as for cell replacement therapy."
17568771,1,J. Gen. Physiol.,2985110R,2009,Prolonged calcium influx after termination of light-induced calcium release in invertebrate photoreceptors.,"In microvillar photoreceptors, light stimulates the phospholipase C cascade and triggers an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ that is essential for the regulation of both visual excitation and sensory adaptation. In some organisms, influx through light-activated ion channels contributes to the Ca2+ increase. In contrast, in other species, such as Lima, Ca2+ is initially only released from an intracellular pool, as the light-sensitive conductance is negligibly permeable to calcium ions. As a consequence, coping with sustained stimulation poses a challenge, requiring an alternative pathway for further calcium mobilization. We observed that after bright or prolonged illumination, the receptor potential of Lima photoreceptors is followed by the gradual development of an after-depolarization that decays in 1-4 minutes. Under voltage clamp, a graded, slow inward current (Islow) can be reproducibly elicited by flashes that saturate the photocurrent, and can reach a peak amplitude in excess of 200 pA. Islow obtains after replacing extracellular Na+ with Li+, guanidinium, or N-methyl-D-glucamine, indicating that it does not reflect the activation of an electrogenic Na/Ca exchange mechanism. An increase in membrane conductance accompanies the slow current. Islow is impervious to anion replacements and can be measured with extracellular Ca2+ as the sole permeant species; Ba can substitute for Ca2+ but Mg2+ cannot. A persistent Ca2+ elevation parallels Islow, when no further internal release takes place. Thus, this slow current could contribute to sustained Ca2+ mobilization and the concomitant regulation of the phototransduction machinery. Although reminiscent of the classical store depletion-operated calcium influx described in other cells, Islow appears to diverge in some significant aspects, such as its large size and insensitivity to SKF96365 and lanthanum; therefore, it may reflect an alternative mechanism for prolonged increase of cytosolic calcium in photoreceptors."
17568772,1,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2009,TOR-mediated autophagy regulates cell death in Drosophila neurodegenerative disease.,"Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a regulator of cell growth. TOR activity can also enhance cell death, and the TOR inhibitor rapamycin protects cells against proapoptotic stimuli. Autophagy, which can protect against cell death, is negatively regulated by TOR, and disruption of autophagy by mutation of Atg5 or Atg7 can lead to neurodegeneration. However, the implied functional connection between TOR signaling, autophagy, and cell death or degeneration has not been rigorously tested. Using the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, we show in this study that hyperactivation of TOR leads to photoreceptor cell death in an age- and light-dependent manner and that this is because of TOR's ability to suppress autophagy. We also find that genetically inhibiting TOR or inducing autophagy suppresses cell death in Drosophila models of Huntington's disease and phospholipase C (norpA)-mediated retinal degeneration. Thus, our data indicate that TOR induces cell death by suppressing autophagy and provide direct genetic evidence that autophagy alleviates cell death in several common types of neurodegenerative disease."

Cell Biol.,375356,2009,The TRC8 E3 ligase ubiquitinates MHC class I molecules before dislocation from the ER.,"The US2 and US11 gene products of human cytomegalovirus promote viral evasion by hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. US2 and US11 initiate dislocation of newly translocated major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby decreasing cell surface MHC I. Despite being instrumental in elucidating the mammalian ERAD pathway, the responsible E3 ligase or ligases remain unknown. Using a functional small interfering RNA library screen, we now identify TRC8 (translocation in renal carcinoma, chromosome 8 gene), an ER-resident E3 ligase previously implicated as a hereditary kidney cancer gene, as required for US2-mediated MHC I ubiquitination. Depletion of TRC8 prevents MHC I ubiquitination and dislocation by US2 and restores cell surface MHC I. TRC8 forms an integral part of a novel multiprotein ER complex that contains MHC I, US2, and signal peptide peptidase. Our data show that the TRC8 E3 ligase is required for MHC I dislocation from the ER and identify a new complex associated with mammalian ERAD."
17568778,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,"Activating receptors promote NK cell expansion for maintenance, IL-10 production, and CD8 T cell regulation during viral infection.","Natural killer (NK) cells have the potential to deliver both direct antimicrobial effects and regulate adaptive immune responses, but NK cell yields have been reported to vary greatly during different viral infections. Activating receptors, including the Ly49H molecule recognizing mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), can stimulate NK cell expansion. To define Ly49H's role in supporting NK cell proliferation and maintenance under conditions of uncontrolled viral infection, experiments were performed in Ly49h(-/-), perforin 1 (Prf1)(-/-), and wild-type (wt) B6 mice. NK cell numbers were similar in uninfected mice, but relative to responses in MCMV-infected wt mice, NK cell yields declined in the absence of Ly49h and increased in the absence of Prf1, with high rates of proliferation and Ly49H expression on nearly all cells. The expansion was abolished in mice deficient for both Ly49h and Prf1 (Ly49h(-/-)Prf1(-/-)), and negative consequences for survival were revealed. The Ly49H-dependent protection mechanism delivered in the absence of Prf1 was a result of interleukin 10 production, by the sustained NK cells, to regulate the magnitude of CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the studies demonstrate a previously unappreciated critical role for activating receptors in keeping NK cells present during viral infection to regulate adaptive immune responses."
17571073,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Overlapping functions of nuclear envelope proteins NET25 (Lem2) and emerin in regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in myoblast differentiation.,"Mutations in certain nuclear envelope (NE) proteins cause muscular dystrophies and other disorders, but the disease mechanisms remain unclear. The nuclear envelope transmembrane protein NET25 (Lem2) is a truncated paralog of MAN1, an NE component linked to bone disorders. NET25 and MAN1 share an approximately 40-residue LEM homology domain with emerin, the protein mutated in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. However, roles for NET25 and MAN1 in myogenesis have not yet been described. Using RNA interference in C2C12 myoblasts, we show for the first time that both NET25 and MAN1 are required for myogenic differentiation. NET25 depletion causes hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 at the onset of differentiation, and pharmacological inhibition of this transient overactivation rescues myogenesis. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of both mitogen-activated protein kinase and transforming growth factor beta signaling is required to rescue differentiation after MAN1 depletion. Ectopic expression of silencing-resistant NET25 rescues myogenesis after depletion of emerin but not after MAN1 silencing. Thus, NET25 and emerin have at least partially overlapping functions during myogenic differentiation, which are distinct from those of MAN1. Our work supports the hypothesis that deregulation of cell signaling contributes to NE-linked disorders and suggests that mutations in NET25 and MAN1 may cause muscle diseases."
17571076,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,The hypoxia-inducible factor 1/NOR-1 axis regulates the survival response of endothelial cells to hypoxia.,"Hypoxia induces apoptosis but also triggers adaptive mechanisms to ensure cell survival. Here we show that the prosurvival effects of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in endothelial cells are mediated by neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NOR-1). The overexpression of NOR-1 decreased the rate of endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis in cultures exposed to hypoxia, while the inhibition of NOR-1 increased cell apoptosis. Hypoxia upregulated NOR-1 mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Blocking antibodies against VEGF or SU5614 (a VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor) did not prevent hypoxia-induced NOR-1 expression, suggesting that NOR-1 is not induced by the autocrine secretion of VEGF in response to hypoxia. The reduction of HIF-1 alpha protein levels by small interfering RNAs, or by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway or mTOR, significantly counteracted hypoxia-induced NOR-1 upregulation. Intracellular Ca(2+) was involved in hypoxia-induced PI3K/Akt activation and in the downstream NOR-1 upregulation. A hypoxia response element mediated the transcriptional activation of NOR-1 induced by hypoxia as we show by transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, the attenuation of NOR-1 expression reduced both basal and hypoxia-induced cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2) mRNA levels, while NOR-1 overexpression upregulated cIAP2. Therefore, NOR-1 is a downstream effector of HIF-1 signaling involved in the survival response of endothelial cells to hypoxia."
17575050,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,A transcriptomic analysis of human centromeric and pericentric sequences in normal and tumor cells.,"Although there is now evidence that the expression of centromeric (CT) and pericentric (PCT) sequences are key players in major genomic functions, their transcriptional status in human cells is still poorly known. The main reason for this lack of data is the complexity and high level of polymorphism of these repeated sequences, which hampers straightforward analyses by available transcriptomic approaches. Here a transcriptomic macro-array dedicated to the analysis of CT and PCT expression is developed and validated in heat-shocked (HS) HeLa cells. For the first time, the expression status of CT and PCT sequences is analyzed in a series of normal and cancer human cells and tissues demonstrating that they are repressed in all normal tissues except in the testis, where PCT transcripts are found. Moreover, PCT sequences are specifically expressed in HS cells in a Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent fashion, and we show here that another independent pathway, involving DNA hypo-methylation, can also trigger their expression. Interestingly, CT and PCT were found illegitimately expressed in somatic cancer samples, whereas PCT were repressed in testis cancer, suggesting that the expression of CT and PCT sequences may represent a good indicator of epigenetic deregulations occurring in response to environmental changes or in cell transformation."

However, 2-D PAGE protein maps with satisfactory proteomic information and comparability to fresh tissues have never been described to date. In the present study, we report 2-D PAGE separation and MS identification of full-length proteins extracted from FFPE skeletal muscle tissue. The 2-D protein profiles obtained from FFPE tissues could be matched to those achieved from frozen tissues replicates. Up to 250 spots were clearly detected in 2-D maps of proteins from FFPE tissue following standard mass-compatible silver staining. Protein spots from both FFPE and frozen tissue 2-D gels were excised, subjected to in situ hydrolysis, and identified by MS analysis. Matched spots produced matched protein identifications. Moreover, 2-D protein maps from FFPE tissues were successfully subjected to Western immunoblotting, producing comparable results to fresh-frozen tissues. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that, when adequately extracted, full-length proteins from FFPE tissues might be suitable to 2-D PAGE-MS analysis, allowing differential proteomic studies on the vast existing archives of healthy and pathological-fixed tissues."

Med.,9502015,2009,Impaired Wnt-beta-catenin signaling disrupts adult renal homeostasis and leads to cystic kidney ciliopathy.,"Cystic kidney disease represents a major cause of end-stage renal disease, yet the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis remain largely unclear. Recent emphasis has been placed on a potential role for canonical Wnt signaling, but investigation of this pathway in adult renal homeostasis is lacking. Here we provide evidence of a previously unidentified canonical Wnt activity in adult mammalian kidney homeostasis, the loss of which leads to cystic kidney disease. Loss of the Jouberin (Jbn) protein in mouse leads to the cystic kidney disease nephronophthisis, owing to an unexpected decrease in endogenous Wnt activity. Jbn interacts with and facilitates beta-catenin nuclear accumulation, resulting in positive modulation of downstream transcription. Finally, we show that Jbn is required in vivo for a Wnt response to injury and renal tubule repair, the absence of which triggers cystogenesis."
17581631,1,Nat. Genet.,9216904,2009,Analysis of the tyrosine kinome in melanoma reveals recurrent mutations in ERBB4.,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas."

We show that beta-lactamase activity associated with B. anthracis is affected by two genes, sigP (BA2502) and rsiP (BA2503), predicted to encode an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor and an anti-sigma factor, respectively. Deletion of the sigP-rsiP locus abolished beta-lactamase activity in a naturally occurring penicillin-resistant strain and had no effect on beta-lactamase activity in a prototypical penicillin-susceptible strain. Complementation with sigP and rsiP from the penicillin-resistant strain, but not with sigP and rsiP from the penicillin-susceptible strain, conferred constitutive beta-lactamase activity in both mutants. These results are attributed to a nucleotide deletion near the 5' end of rsiP in the penicillin-resistant strain that is predicted to result in a nonfunctional protein. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis sigP and rsiP homologues are required for inducible penicillin resistance in these species. Expression of the B. cereus or B. thuringiensis sigP and rsiP genes in a B. anthracis sigP-rsiP-null mutant confers inducible production of beta-lactamase activity, suggesting that while B. anthracis contains the genes necessary for sensing beta-lactam antibiotics, the B. anthracis sigP and rsiP gene products are not sufficient for bla induction."
17581635,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,The reducible complexity of a mitochondrial molecular machine.,"Molecular machines drive essential biological processes, with the component parts of these machines each contributing a partial function or structural element. Mitochondria are organelles of eukaryotic cells, and depend for their biogenesis on a set of molecular machines for protein transport. How these molecular machines evolved is a fundamental question. Mitochondria were derived from an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont, and we identified in alpha-proteobacteria the component parts of a mitochondrial protein transport machine. In bacteria, the components are found in the inner membrane, topologically equivalent to the mitochondrial proteins. Although the bacterial proteins function in simple assemblies, relatively little mutation would be required to convert them to function as a protein transport machine. This analysis of protein transport provides a blueprint for the evolution of cellular machinery in general."
17581636,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,An interference account of cue-independent forgetting in the no-think paradigm.,"Memory suppression is investigated with the no-think paradigm, which produces forgetting following repeated practice of not thinking about a memory [Anderson MC, Green C (2001) Nature 410:366-369]. Because the forgotten item is not retrieved even when tested with an independent, semantically related cue, it has been assumed that this forgetting is due to an inhibition process. However, this conclusion is based on a single stage to recall, whereas global memory models, which produce forgetting through a process of interference, include both a sampling and a recovery stage to recall. By assuming that interference exists during recovery, these models can explain cue-independent forgetting. We tested several predictions of this interference explanation of cue-independent forgetting by modifying the think/no-think paradigm. We added a condition where participants quickly pressed enter rather than not thinking. We also manipulated initial memory strength and tested recognition memory. Most importantly, learning to quickly press enter produced as much cue-independent forgetting as no-think instructions. Demonstrating the adequacy of two-stage recall, a simple computational model (SAM-RI) simultaneously captured the original cue, independent cue, and recognition results."
17581638,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Divergent investment strategies of Acacia myrmecophytes and the coexistence of mutualists and exploiters.,"Ant-plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies, from exploitative to mutualistic, and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood. Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia-Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment-payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved."
17586502,1,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2010,Novel targeted therapeutics for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Virtually all patients that succumb to prostate cancer die of metastatic castration-resistant disease. Although docetaxel is the standard of care for these patients and is associated with a modest prolongation of survival, there is an urgent need for novel treatment strategies for metastatic prostate cancer. In the last several years, great strides have been made in our understanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms driving prostate cancer growth and progression, and this has resulted in widespread clinical testing of numerous new targeted therapies. This review discusses some of the key therapeutic agents that have emerged for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the last 5years, with an emphasis on both molecular targets and clinical trial design. These agents include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors, anti-angiogenic drugs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway inhibitors, apoptosis-inducing drugs, endothelin receptor antagonists, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK) ligand inhibitors, vitamin D analogues, cytochrome P17 enzyme inhibitors, androgen receptor modulators, epigenetic therapies, vaccine therapies, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4 blocking agents."
17592114,1,Mol. Cell,9802571,2009,TERRA RNA binding to TRF2 facilitates heterochromatin formation and ORC recruitment at telomeres.,"Telomere-repeat-encoding RNA (referred to as TERRA) has been identified as a potential component of yeast and mammalian telomeres. We show here that TERRA RNA interacts with several telomere-associated proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 (TRF1) and 2 (TRF2), subunits of the origin recognition complex (ORC), heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), histone H3 trimethyl K9 (H3 K9me3), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway. siRNA depletion of TERRA caused an increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci, aberrations in metaphase telomeres, and a loss of histone H3 K9me3 and ORC at telomere repeat DNA. Previous studies found that TRF2 amino-terminal GAR domain recruited ORC to telomeres. We now show that TERRA RNA can interact directly with the TRF2 GAR and ORC1 to form a stable ternary complex. We conclude that TERRA facilitates TRF2 interaction with ORC and plays a central role in telomere structural maintenance and heterochromatin formation."
17599063,1,Curr. Biol.,9107782,2009,Human Y chromosome base-substitution mutation rate measured by direct sequencing in a deep-rooting pedigree.,"Understanding the key process of human mutation is important for many aspects of medical genetics and human evolution. In the past, estimates of mutation rates have generally been inferred from phenotypic observations or comparisons of homologous sequences among closely related species. Here, we apply new sequencing technology to measure directly one mutation rate, that of base substitutions on the human Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes of two individuals separated by 13 generations were flow sorted and sequenced by Illumina (Solexa) paired-end sequencing to an average depth of 11x or 20x, respectively. Candidate mutations were further examined by capillary sequencing in cell-line and blood DNA from the donors and additional family members. Twelve mutations were confirmed in approximately 10.15 Mb; eight of these had occurred in vitro and four in vivo. The latter could be placed in different positions on the pedigree and led to a mutation-rate measurement of 3.0 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95% CI: 8.9 x 10(-9)-7.0 x 10(-8)), consistent with estimates of 2.3 x 10(-8)-6.3 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation for the same Y-chromosomal region from published human-chimpanzee comparisons depending on the generation and split times assumed."
17599065,1,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2010,Antioxidants potentiate American ginseng-induced killing of colorectal cancer cells.,"Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Novel prevention or therapeutic agents are needed to better manage this disease. American ginseng is a commonly used herb and is believed to have lots of health benefits, including anti-cancer activities. However there have been very few in-depth studies of the activities of this herb at the molecular level. In this report we showed that 4h-steamed American ginseng root extract (S4h) induced mitochondrial damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. We showed that the NF-kappaB pathway was activated by S4h and that removal of ROS inhibited S4h-induced NF-kappaB activation. We further showed that both antioxidants and a specific inhibitor of the NF-kappaB pathway enhanced S4h-induced cell death. Finally, we showed that protecting the mitochondria decreased both the level of ROS and apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that S4h-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells is mediated by mitochondria damage and that damage to the mitochondria activates both the apoptosis pathway and the ROS/NF-kappaB mediated survival pathway. These results further suggest that the anti-cancer effect of steamed ginseng can be enhanced by antioxidants or inhibitors of the NF-kappaB pathway."
17599066,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Evolutionary triplet models of structured RNA.,"The reconstruction and synthesis of ancestral RNAs is a feasible goal for paleogenetics. This will require new bioinformatics methods, including a robust statistical framework for reconstructing histories of substitutions, indels and structural changes. We describe a &quot;transducer composition&quot; algorithm for extending pairwise probabilistic models of RNA structural evolution to models of multiple sequences related by a phylogenetic tree. This algorithm draws on formal models of computational linguistics as well as the 1985 protosequence algorithm of David Sankoff. The output of the composition algorithm is a multiple-sequence stochastic context-free grammar. We describe dynamic programming algorithms, which are robust to null cycles and empty bifurcations, for parsing this grammar. Example applications include structural alignment of non-coding RNAs, propagation of structural information from an experimentally-characterized sequence to its homologs, and inference of the ancestral structure of a set of diverged RNAs. We implemented the above algorithms for a simple model of pairwise RNA structural evolution; in particular, the algorithms for maximum likelihood (ML) alignment of three known RNA structures and a known phylogeny and inference of the common ancestral structure. We compared this ML algorithm to a variety of related, but simpler, techniques, including ML alignment algorithms for simpler models that omitted various aspects of the full model and also a posterior-decoding alignment algorithm for one of the simpler models. In our tests, incorporation of basepair structure was the most important factor for accurate alignment inference; appropriate use of posterior-decoding was next; and fine details of the model were least important. Posterior-decoding heuristics can be substantially faster than exact phylogenetic inference, so this motivates the use of sum-over-pairs heuristics where possible (and approximate sum-over-pairs). For more exact probabilistic inference, we discuss the use of transducer composition for ML (or MCMC) inference on phylogenies, including possible ways to make the core operations tractable."
17599067,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Intracellular regulation of human ClC-5 by adenine nucleotides.,"ClC-5, an endosomal Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter that is mutated in Dent disease, is essential for endosomal acidification and re-uptake of small molecular weight proteins in the renal proximal tubule. Eukaryotic chloride channels (CLCs) contain two cytoplasmic CBS domains, motifs present in different proteins, the function of which is still poorly understood. Structural studies have shown that ClC-5 can bind to ATP at the interface between the CBS domains, but so far the potential functional consequences of nucleotide binding to ClC-5 have not been investigated. Here, we show that the direct application of ATP, ADP and AMP in inside-out patch experiments potentiates the current mediated by ClC-5 with similar affinities. The nucleotides increase the probability of ClC-5 to be in an active, transporting state. The residues Tyr 617 and Asp 727, but not Ser 618, are crucial for the potentiation. These results provide a mechanistic and structural framework for the interpretation of nucleotide regulation of a CLC transporter."
17599839,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,The ERCC1/XPF endonuclease is required for completion of homologous recombination at DNA replication forks stalled by inter-strand cross-links.,"Both the ERCC1-XPF complex and the proteins involved in homoIogous recombination (HR) have critical roles in inter-strand cross-link (ICL) repair. Here, we report that mitomycin C-induced lesions inhibit replication fork elongation. Furthermore, mitomycin C-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the result of the collapse of ICL-stalled replication forks. These are not formed through replication run off, as we show that mitomycin C or cisplatin-induced DNA lesions are not incised by global genome nucleotide excision repair (GGR). We also suggest that ICL-lesion repair is initiated either by replication or transcription, as the GGR does not incise ICL-lesions. Furthermore, we report that RAD51 foci are induced by cisplatin or mitomycin C independently of ERCC1, but that mitomycin C-induced HR measured in a reporter construct is impaired in ERCC1-defective cells. These data suggest that ERCC1-XPF plays a role in completion of HR in ICL repair. We also find no additional sensitivity to cisplatin by siRNA co-depletion of XRCC3 and ERCC1, showing that the two proteins act on the same pathway to promote survival."
17605817,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Extracellular chloride regulates the epithelial sodium channel.,"The extracellular domain of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC is exposed to a wide range of Cl(-) concentrations in the kidney and in other epithelia. We tested whether Cl(-) alters ENaC activity. In Xenopus oocytes expressing human ENaC, replacement of Cl(-) with SO4(2-), H2PO4(-), or SCN(-) produced a large increase in ENaC current, indicating that extracellular Cl(-) inhibits ENaC. Extracellular Cl(-) also inhibited ENaC in Na+-transporting epithelia. The anion selectivity sequence was SCN(-) &lt; SO4(2-) &lt; H2PO4(-) &lt; F(-) &lt; I(-) &lt; Cl(-) &lt; Br(-). Crystallization of ASIC1a revealed a Cl(-) binding site in the extracellular domain. We found that mutation of corresponding residues in ENaC (alpha(H418A) and beta(R388A)) disrupted the response to Cl(-), suggesting that Cl(-) might regulate ENaC through an analogous binding site. Maneuvers that lock ENaC in an open state (a DEG mutation and trypsin) abolished ENaC regulation by Cl(-). The response to Cl(-) was also modulated by changes in extracellular pH; acidic pH increased and alkaline pH reduced ENaC inhibition by Cl(-). Cl(-) regulated ENaC activity in part through enhanced Na+ self-inhibition, a process by which extracellular Na+ inhibits ENaC. Together, the data indicate that extracellular Cl(-) regulates ENaC activity, providing a potential mechanism by which changes in extracellular Cl(-) might modulate epithelial Na+ absorption."
17608567,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Structure of the mature Streptococcal cysteine protease exotoxin mSpeB in its active dimeric form.,"Invasive infections of Streptococcus pyogenes are dependent on the cysteine protease streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B. Previous structures of the enzyme have not disclosed the proper active-site configuration. Here, the crystal structure of the mature enzyme is presented to 1.55 A, disclosing a homodimer. A serine from one subunit inserts into the active site of the other to donate to the oxyanion hole and coordinates the ligand proximal to the active-site cysteine. Dimerization is unique to the mature form and is clearly a prerequisite for catalysis. The present structure supports a tripartite switch system that is triggered upon dimerization and substrate binding: (1) liberation of the active-site histidine from an inactive configuration, (2) relocation of residues blocking the substrate binding pockets and (3) repositioning of two active-site tryptophans to settle in the active configuration. Based on the present structure, the active site of clan CA cysteine proteases is expanded and a detailed mechanism of the deacylation mechanism is proposed. The results may have applications for the development of protease inhibitors specific to bacterial cysteine proteases."
17609115,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Playing charades in the fMRI: are mirror and/or mentalizing areas involved in gestural communication?,"Communication is an important aspect of human life, allowing us to powerfully coordinate our behaviour with that of others. Boiled down to its mere essentials, communication entails transferring a mental content from one brain to another. Spoken language obviously plays an important role in communication between human individuals. Manual gestures however often aid the semantic interpretation of the spoken message, and gestures may have played a central role in the earlier evolution of communication. Here we used the social game of charades to investigate the neural basis of gestural communication by having participants produce and interpret meaningful gestures while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While participants decoded observed gestures, the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS: premotor, parietal and posterior mid-temporal cortex), associated with motor simulation, and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), associated with mentalizing and agency attribution, were significantly recruited. Of these areas only the pMNS was recruited during the production of gestures. This suggests that gestural communication relies on a combination of simulation and, during decoding, mentalizing/agency attribution brain areas. Comparing the decoding of gestures with a condition in which participants viewed the same gestures with an instruction not to interpret the gestures showed that although parts of the pMNS responded more strongly during active decoding, most of the pMNS and the TPJ did not show such significant task effects. This suggests that the mere observation of gestures recruits most of the system involved in voluntary interpretation."
17612295,1,Nature,410462,2009,Population context determines cell-to-cell variability in endocytosis and virus infection.,"Single-cell heterogeneity in cell populations arises from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This heterogeneity has been measured for gene transcription, phosphorylation, cell morphology and drug perturbations, and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology. In all cases, however, the causes of heterogeneity were not studied. Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis and membrane lipid composition in adherent human cells. We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context. We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection. Our findings provide an explanation for the origin of heterogeneity patterns of cellular activities in adherent cell populations."
17615063,1,Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,9113221,2009,Triggering of suicidal erythrocyte death by amphotericin B.,"Amphotericin B is widely used as antifungal drug. Side effects include anemia. A variety of drugs and diseases associated with anemia has recently been shown to trigger suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, i.e. cell membrane scrambling and cell shrinkage. Eryptosis may be triggered by increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity and by lack of ATP. The present study explored whether amphotericin B stimulates eryptosis. Cell membrane scrambling was estimated from annexin V-binding to phosphatidylserine exposed at the cell surface, cell shrinkage from forward scatter in FACS analysis, cytosolic Ca2+ activity from Fluo3 fluorescence and the cytosolic ATP concentration from a luciferase-based assay. Exposure to amphotericin B (0.1-1 microg/ml) within 48 hours significantly increased annexin V-binding, decreased forward scatter, increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity and decreased cytosolic ATP content. In conclusion, amphotericin B stimulates suicidal cell death of erythrocytes, which may in turn contribute to the clearance of circulating erythrocytes and thus to anemia."
17620405,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Early triggering of exclusive IFN-gamma responses of human Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells by TLR-activated myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells.,"gammadelta T cells, a major innate-like T cell subset, are thought to play in vivo an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses to various infection agents like parasites, bacteria, or viruses but the mechanisms contributing to this immune process remain ill defined. Owing to their ability to recognize a broad set of microbial molecular patterns, TLRs represent a major innate pathway through which pathogens induce dendritic cells (DC) maturation and acquisition of immunostimulatory functions. In this study, we studied the effects of various TLR ligands on the activation of human Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, a main human gammadelta PBL subset, which has been recently involved in the licensing of mycobacteria-infected DC. Both TLR3 and TLR4, but not TLR2 ligands, induced a rapid, strong, and exclusive IFN-gamma production by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. This gammadelta subset contributed to a large extent to the overall PBL IFN-gamma response induced after short-term TLR stimulation of human PBMC. Importantly, this phenomenon primarily depended on type I IFN, but not IL-12, produced by monocytic DC upon TLR engagement. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells were similarly activated by plasmacytoid DC upon TLR8/9 activation or Yellow Fever virus infection. Moreover TLR-induced Vgamma9Vdelta2 IFN-gamma noncytolytic response led to efficient DC polarization into IL-12p70-producing cells. Our results support an adjuvant role played by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells along microbial infections through a particular cross-talk with pathogen-associated molecular patterns-activated DC. Moreover they provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying functional activation of this unique peripheral innate-like T cell subset during viral infections."
17620599,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Otoferlin is critical for a highly sensitive and linear calcium-dependent exocytosis at vestibular hair cell ribbon synapses.,"Otoferlin, a C2-domain-containing Ca(2+) binding protein, is required for synaptic exocytosis in auditory hair cells. However, its exact role remains essentially unknown. Intriguingly enough, no balance defect has been observed in otoferlin-deficient (Otof(-/-)) mice. Here, we show that the vestibular nerve compound action potentials evoked during transient linear acceleration ramps in Otof(-/-) mice display higher threshold, lower amplitude, and increased latency compared with wild-type mice. Using patch-clamp capacitance measurement in intact utricles, we show that type I and type II hair cells display a remarkable linear transfer function between Ca(2+) entry, flowing through voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels, and exocytosis. This linear Ca(2+) dependence was observed when changing the Ca(2+) channel open probability or the Ca(2+) flux per channel during various test potentials. In Otof(-/-) hair cells, exocytosis displays slower kinetics, reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity, and nonlinear Ca(2+) dependence, despite morphologically normal synapses and normal Ca(2+) currents. We conclude that otoferlin is essential for a high-affinity Ca(2+) sensor function that allows efficient and linear encoding of low-intensity stimuli at the vestibular hair cell synapse."
17620619,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Blocking hepatitis C virus infection with recombinant form of envelope protein 2 ectodomain.,"More than 120 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), making HCV infection the leading cause of liver transplantation in developed countries. Treatment is limited, and efficacy depends upon the infecting strain and the initial viral load. The HCV envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) are involved in receptor binding, virus-cell fusion, and entry into the host cell. HCV infection proceeds by endosomal acidification, suggesting that fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes is a pH-triggered event. E2 consists of an amino-terminal ectodomain, an amphipathic helix that forms a stem region, and a carboxy-terminal membrane-associating segment. We have devised a novel expression system for the production of a secreted form of E2 ectodomain (eE2) from mammalian cells and performed a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical characterization. eE2 is properly folded, as determined by binding to human CD81, blocking of infection of cell culture-derived HCV, and recognition by antibodies from patients chronically infected with different genotypes of HCV. The glycosylation pattern, number of disulfide bonds, oligomerization state, and secondary structure of eE2 have been characterized using mass spectrometry, size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and analytical ultracentrifugation. These results advance the understanding of E2 and may assist in the design of an HCV vaccine and entry inhibitor."
17626179,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Structure of an arrestin2-clathrin complex reveals a novel clathrin binding domain that modulates receptor trafficking.,"Non-visual arrestins play a pivotal role as adaptor proteins in regulating the signaling and trafficking of multiple classes of receptors. Although arrestin interaction with clathrin, AP-2, and phosphoinositides contributes to receptor trafficking, little is known about the configuration and dynamics of these interactions. Here, we identify a novel interface between arrestin2 and clathrin through x-ray diffraction analysis. The intrinsically disordered clathrin binding box of arrestin2 interacts with a groove between blades 1 and 2 in the clathrin beta-propeller domain, whereas an 8-amino acid splice loop found solely in the long isoform of arrestin2 (arrestin2L) interacts with a binding pocket formed by blades 4 and 5 in clathrin. The apposition of the two binding sites in arrestin2L suggests that they are exclusive and may function in higher order macromolecular structures. Biochemical analysis demonstrates direct binding of clathrin to the splice loop in arrestin2L, whereas functional analysis reveals that both binding domains contribute to the receptor-dependent redistribution of arrestin2L to clathrin-coated pits. Mutagenesis studies reveal that the clathrin binding motif in the splice loop is (L/I)(2)GXL. Taken together, these data provide a framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between arrestin2 and clathrin and reveal an essential role for this interaction in arrestin-mediated endocytosis."
17626883,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Phosphorylation of threonine 3: implications for Huntingtin aggregation and neurotoxicity.,"Huntingtin (Htt) is a widely expressed protein that causes tissue-specific degeneration when mutated to contain an expanded polyglutamine (poly(Q)) domain. Although Htt is large, 350 kDa, the appearance of amino-terminal fragments of Htt in extracts of postmortem brain tissue from patients with Huntington disease (HD), and the fact that an amino-terminal fragment, Htt exon 1 protein (Httex1p), is sufficient to cause disease in models of HD, points to the importance of the amino-terminal region of Htt in the disease process. The first exon of Htt encodes 17 amino acids followed by a poly(Q) repeat of variable length and culminating with a proline-rich domain of 50 amino acids. Because modifications to this fragment have the potential to directly affect pathogenesis in several ways, we have surveyed this fragment for potential post-translational modifications that might affect Htt behavior and detected several modifications of Httex1p. Here we report that the most prevalent modifications of Httex1p are NH(2)-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation of threonine 3 (pThr-3). We demonstrate that pThr-3 occurs on full-length Htt in vivo, and that this modification affects the aggregation and pathogenic properties of Htt. Thus, therapeutic strategies that modulate these events could in turn affect Htt pathogenesis."
17627274,1,BMC Genet.,100966978,2009,Single-feature polymorphism discovery by computing probe affinity shape powers.,"BACKGROUND: Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) discovery is a rapid and cost-effective approach to identify DNA polymorphisms. However, high false positive rates and/or low sensitivity are prevalent in previously described SFP detection methods. This work presents a new computing method for SFP discovery. RESULTS: The probe affinity differences and affinity shape powers formed by the neighboring probes in each probe set were computed into SFP weight scores. This method was validated by known sequence information and was comprehensively compared with previously-reported methods using the same datasets. A web application using this algorithm has been implemented for SFP detection. Using this method, we identified 364 SFPs in a barley near-isogenic line pair carrying either the wild type or the mutant uniculm2 (cul2) allele. Most of the SFP polymorphisms were identified on chromosome 6H in the vicinity of the Cul2 locus. CONCLUSION: This SFP discovery method exhibits better performance in specificity and sensitivity over previously-reported methods. It can be used for other organisms for which GeneChip technology is available. The web-based tool will facilitate SFP discovery. The 364 SFPs discovered in a barley near-isogenic line pair provide a set of genetic markers for fine mapping and future map-based cloning of the Cul2 locus."

RESULTS: Fruits of Coratina, a widely cultivated variety characterized by a very high phenolic content, and Tendellone, an oleuropein-lacking natural variant, were used as starting material for monitoring the transcriptome. Four different cDNA libraries were sequenced, respectively at the beginning and at the end of drupe development. A total of 261,485 reads were obtained, for an output of about 58 Mb. Raw sequence data were processed using a four step pipeline procedure and data were stored in a relational database with a web interface. CONCLUSION: Massively parallel sequencing of different fruit cDNA collections has provided large scale information about the structure and putative function of gene transcripts accumulated during fruit development. Comparative transcript profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes with potential relevance in regulating the fruit metabolism and phenolic content during ripening."
17627279,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Structure analysis of the flavoredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F reveals key residues that discriminate the functions and properties of the flavin reductase family.,"The crystal structure of flavoredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F was determined at 1.05 A resolution and its ferric reductase activity was examined. The aim was to elucidate whether flavoredoxin has structural similarity to ferric reductase and ferric reductase activity, based on the sequence similarity to ferric reductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. As expected, flavoredoxin shared a common overall structure with A. fulgidus ferric reductase and displayed weak ferric reductase and flavin reductase activities; however, flavoredoxin contains two FMN molecules per dimer, unlike A. fulgidus ferric reductase, which has only one FMN molecule per dimer. Compared with A. fulgidus ferric reductase, flavoredoxin forms three additional hydrogen bonds and has a significantly smaller solvent-accessible surface area. These observations explain the higher affinity of flavoredoxin for FMN. Unexpectedly, an electron-density map indicated the presence of a Mes molecule on the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, and that two zinc ions are bound to the two cysteine residues, Cys39 and Cys40, adjacent to FMN. These two cysteine residues are close to one of the putative ferric ion binding sites of ferric reductase. Based on their structural similarities, we conclude that the corresponding site of ferric reductase is the most plausible site for ferric ion binding. Comparing the structures with related flavin proteins revealed key structural features regarding the discrimination of function (ferric ion or flavin reduction) and a unique electron transport system."
17627282,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Pre- and postnatal nutritional histories influence reproductive maturation and ovarian function in the rat.,"BACKGROUND: While prepubertal nutritional influences appear to play a role in sexual maturation, there is a need to clarify the potential contributions of maternal and childhood influences in setting the tempo of reproductive maturation. In the present study we employed an established model of nutritional programming to evaluate the relative influences of prenatal and postnatal nutrition on growth and ovarian function in female offspring. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were fed either a calorie-restricted diet, a high fat diet, or a control diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Offspring then were fed either a control or a high fat diet from the time of weaning to adulthood. Pubertal age was monitored and blood samples collected in adulthood for endocrine analyses. RESULTS: We report that in the female rat, pubertal timing and subsequent ovarian function is influenced by the animal's nutritional status in utero, with both maternal caloric restriction and maternal high fat nutrition resulting in early pubertal onset. Depending on the offspring's nutritional history during the prenatal and lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further influence offspring reproductive tempo, which was dominated by the effect of prenatal nutrition. Whereas maternal calorie restriction leads to early pubertal onset, it also leads to a reduction in adult progesterone levels later in life. In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding which also induces early maturation in offspring was associated with elevated progesterone concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These observations are suggestive of two distinct developmental pathways leading to the acceleration of pubertal timing but with different consequences for ovarian function. We suggest different adaptive explanations for these pathways and for their relationship to altered metabolic homeostasis."
17627283,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,MI-63: a novel small-molecule inhibitor targets MDM2 and induces apoptosis in embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells with wild-type p53.,"BACKGROUND: Interruption of the role of p53s as a tumour suppressor by MDM2 may be one of the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade current therapy. Blocking the inhibition of wild-type p53 by MDM2 in cancer cells should reactivate p53's tumour suppressor functions and enhance current cancer treatments. MI-63 is a novel non-peptide small molecule that has shown strong binding affinity (K(i)=3 nM) for MDM2; however, its effects on paediatric cancer cells and the specific mechanism of tumour suppressor reactivation have not been evaluated. METHODS: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma, expresses either wild-type or mutant p53 protein. We examined the inhibitory effects of MI-63 in embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS (ARMS) cell lines expressing wild-type or mutated p53. RESULTS: Treatment with MI-63 reduced cell viability by 13.4% and by &lt;1%, respectively, at 72 h in both RH36 and RH18 cell lines expressing wild-type p53. In contrast, RH30 and RD2 cells expressing p53 mutants are resistant to MI-63 treatment. An increased expression of p53, p21(WAF1), and Bax protein was observed after treatment with MI-63 in RMS cells with wild-type p53, and apoptosis was confirmed by cleaved PARP and caspase-3 expression. However, RD2 and RH30 RMS cells, as well as human normal skeletal muscle cells, showed a minimal increase in p53 signalling and no induction of cleaved PARP and caspase-3. MI-63 was compared with Nutlin-3, a known MDM2 inhibitor, and was found to be more potent in the inhibition of cell proliferation/viability. Further, synergy was observed when MI-63 was used in combination with doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MI-63 is a potent therapeutic agent for RMS cells expressing wild-type p53 protein."
17627824,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Hsp-27 expression at diagnosis predicts poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer independent of ETS-gene rearrangement.,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to test the hypothesis that expression of small heat shock protein Hsp-27 is, at diagnosis, a reliable predictive biomarker of clinically aggressive prostate cancer. METHODS: A panel of tissue microarrays constructed from a well-characterised cohort of 553 men with conservatively managed prostate cancer was stained immunohistochemically to detect Hsp-27 protein. Hsp-27 expression was compared with a series of pathological and clinical parameters, including outcome. RESULTS: Hsp-27 staining was indicative of higher Gleason score (P&lt;0.001). In tissue cores having a Gleason score &gt;7, the presence of Hsp-27 retained its power to independently predict poor clinical outcome (P&lt;0.002). Higher levels of Hsp-27 staining were almost entirely restricted to cancers lacking ERG rearrangements (chi2 trend=31.4, P&lt;0.001), although this distribution did not have prognostic significance. INTERPRETATION: This study has confirmed that, in prostate cancers managed conservatively over a period of more than 15 years, expression of Hsp-27 is an accurate and independent predictive biomarker of aggressive disease with poor clinical outcome (P&lt;0.001). These findings suggest that apoptotic and cell-migration pathways modulated by Hsp-27 may contain targets susceptible to the development of biologically appropriate chemotherapeutic agents that are likely to prove effective in treating aggressive prostate cancers."
17631528,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Mutagenicity and potential carcinogenicity of thiopurine treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are effective immune modulators and cytotoxic agents extensively used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, and cancer. There is compelling epidemiologic evidence that thiopurine treatment increases the risk for a variety of tumors by mechanisms that are unclear. We investigated the in vivo mutagenicity of long-term thiopurine treatment by determining the frequency and spectra of somatic mutation events at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in peripheral T lymphocytes as well as the prevalence of mutant clonal proliferation in a cross-sectional analysis of data from 119 children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ANOVA and regression were performed to assess relationships among the frequency and spectra of HPRT mutations with disease, duration of illness, duration of treatment, and total therapeutic dose of azathioprine and 6-MP. We observed a significant increase in the frequency of somatic mutations in 56 subjects treated with thiopurines for IBD compared with 63 subjects not treated with thiopurines. This increase was related to both total dose (P &lt; 0.001) and duration of treatment (P &lt; 0.001). Comparative mutation spectra analysis of 1,020 mutant isolates revealed a significant increase in the proportion of all transitions (P &lt; 0.001), particularly G:C to A:T transitions (P &lt; 0.001). Combined analyses of two signatures for mutant clonality, HPRT mutation, and T-cell receptor beta CDR3 region unique gene sequence also showed a significant thiopurine-dependent increase in mutant cell clonal proliferation (P &lt; 0.001). These findings provide in vivo evidence for mutation induction as a potential carcinogenic mechanism associated with chronic thiopurine intervention."
17635912,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease-correlated cleavage site mutations enhance inhibitor resistance.,"Drug resistance is an important cause of antiretroviral therapy failure in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Mutations in the protease render the virus resistant to protease inhibitors (PIs). Gag cleavage sites also mutate, sometimes correlating with resistance mutations in the protease, but their contribution to resistance has not been systematically analyzed. The present study examines mutations in Gag cleavage sites that associate with protease mutations and the impact of these associations on drug susceptibilities. Significant associations were observed between mutations in the nucleocapsid-p1 (NC-p1) and p1-p6 cleavage sites and various PI resistance-associated mutations in the protease. Several patterns were frequently observed, including mutations in the NC-p1 cleavage site in combination with I50L, V82A, and I84V within the protease and mutations within the p1-p6 cleavage site in combination with D30N, I50V, and I84V within the protease. For most patterns, viruses with mutations both in the protease and in either cleavage site were significantly less susceptible to specific PIs than viruses with mutations in the protease alone. Altered PI resistance in HIV-1 was found to be associated with the presence of Gag cleavage site mutations. These studies suggest that associated cleavage site mutations may contribute to PI susceptibility in highly specific ways depending on the particular combinations of mutations and inhibitors. Thus, cleavage site mutations should be considered when assessing the level of PI resistance."
17637340,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,An intrinsic quality-control mechanism ensures unconventional secretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 in a folded conformation.,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a proangiogenic mitogen that is secreted by an unconventional mechanism, which does not depend on a functional ER-Golgi system. FGF2 is first recruited to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, in a process that is mediated by the phosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P(2). On the extracellular side, membrane-proximal FGF2-binding sites provided by heparan-sulfate proteoglycans are essential for trapping and accumulating FGF2 in the extracellular space. Here we demonstrate that FGF2 membrane translocation can occur in a folded conformation, i.e. unfolded molecules are not obligatory intermediates in FGF2 secretion. Furthermore, we find that initial sorting into its export pathway requires FGF2 to be folded, because the interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P(2) is lost upon unfolding of FGF2. Our combined findings suggest an intrinsic quality-control mechanism that ensures extracellular accumulation of FGF2 in a biologically active form."
17641687,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Dopamine regulates phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 by engaging Src-homology-2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced receptor phosphorylation is the crucial step for initiating downstream signaling pathways that lead to angiogenesis or related pathophysiological outcomes. Our previous studies have shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine could inhibit VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), endothelial cell proliferation, migration, microvascular permeability, and thus, angiogenesis. In this study, we address the mechanism by which VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is regulated by dopamine. Here, we demonstrate that D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) colocalizes with VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. Dopamine pretreatment increases the translocation and colocalization of Src-homology-2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) with D2DR at the cell surface. Dopamine administration leads to increased VEGF-induced phosphorylation of SHP-2 and this increased phosphorylation parallels the increased phosphatase activity of SHP-2. Active SHP-2 then dephosphorylates VEGFR-2 at Y951, Y996 and Y1059, but not Y1175. We also observe that SHP-2 knockdown impairs the dopamine-regulated inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and, subsequently, Src phosphorylation and migration. Our data establish a novel role for SHP-2 phosphatase in the dopamine-mediated regulation of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation."
17641689,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,ICP0 enables and monitors the function of D cyclins in herpes simplex virus 1 infected cells.,"The herpes simplex virus 1 ICP0 is a regulatory protein. Early in infection ICP0 localizes in ND10 bodies and performs two functions: As an E3 ligase in conjunction with E2 UbcH5a conjugating enzyme, it degrades the ND10 components PML and SP100. Concurrently, it suppresses the silencing of viral DNA by dispersing the HDAC1/CoREST/REST/LSD1 repressor complex. Subsequently, ICP0 is exported to the cytoplasm. In cells treated with HDAC inhibitors or transfected with irrelevant DNA, the export is delayed in a DNA dose-dependent fashion. Here, we follow up an observation that ICP0 binds cyclin D3 and that ICP0 mutants unable to bind cyclin D3 are not exported. Moreover, in infected cells cdk4 is activated, but cdk2 is not. We report that (i) cyclin D1, D2, or D3 colocalize with ND10 bodies and ICP0 early in infection and ultimately become incorporated into viral replication compartments, (ii) each of the D cyclins partially rescues DeltaICP0 mutants, and (iii) inhibition of cdk4 by inhibitor I sequesters ICP0 in the nucleus. A key finding is that overexpression of cyclin D3 enables the transport of ICP0 to the cytoplasm. We conclude that (i) ICP0 facilitates the recruitment of cyclin D3 to the sites of viral DNA synthesis, (ii) until its functions are completed, ICP0 is retained in the nucleus, and (iii) a common signal that results in the export of ICP0 to the cytoplasm is the accumulation of a viral DNA-synthesis-dependent late protein."
17644729,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Selective activation of FGFR4 by an FGF19 variant does not improve glucose metabolism in ob/ob mice.,"FGF19 is a hormone that regulates bile acid and glucose homeostasis. Progress has been made in identifying cofactors for receptor activation. However, several functions of FGF19 have not yet been fully defined, including the actions of FGF19 on target tissues, its FGF receptor specificity, and the contributions of other cofactors, such as heparin. Here, we explore the requirements for FGF19-FGFR/co-receptor interactions and signaling in detail. We show that betaKlotho was essential for FGF19 interaction with FGFRs 1c, 2c, and 3c, but FGF19 was able to interact directly with FGFR4 in the absence of betaKlotho in a heparin-dependent manner. Further, FGF19 activated FGFR4 signaling in the presence or absence of betaKlotho, but activation of FGFRs 1c, 2c, or 3c was completely betaKlotho dependent. We then generated an FGF19 molecule, FGF19dCTD, which has a deletion of the C-terminal region responsible for betaKlotho interaction. We determined that betaKlotho-dependent FGFR1c, 2c, and 3c interactions and activation were abolished, and betaKlotho-independent FGFR4 activation was preserved; therefore, FGF19dCTD is an FGFR4-specific activator. This unique FGF19 molecule specifically activated FGFR4-dependent signaling in liver and suppressed CYP7A1 expression in vivo, but was unable to activate signaling in adipose where FGFR4 expression is very low. Interestingly, unlike FGF19, treatment of ob/ob mice with FGF19dCTD failed to improve glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that FGF19-regulated liver bile acid metabolism could be independent of its glucose-lowering effect, and direct FGFR activation in adipose tissue may play an important role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis."

This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction."
17660750,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) modulates the effect of SGK1 and WNK4 on ROMK channels.,"WNK4 (with no lysine kinase 4) inhibits ROMK channel activity in the distal nephron by stimulating clathrin-dependent endocytosis, an effect attenuated by SGK1 (serum-glucocorticoids-induced kinase)-mediated phosphorylation. It has been suggested that increased ROMK activity because of SGK1-mediated inhibition of WNK4 plays a role in promoting renal K secretion in response to elevated serum K or high K (HK) intake. In contrast, intravascular volume depletion also increases SGK1 activity but fails to stimulate ROMK channels and K secretion. Because HK intake decreases Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity an inhibitor of ROMK channels, it is possible that Src family PTK may modulate the effects of SGK1 on WNK4. Here, we show that c-Src prevents SGK1 from attenuating WNK4's inhibition of ROMK activity. This effect of c-Src was WNK4-dependent because c-Src had no effect on ROMK harboring mutation at the site of c-Src phosphorylation (R1Y337A) in the absence of WNK4. Moreover, expression c-Src diminished the SGK1-mediated increase in serine phosphorylation of WNK4, suggesting that c-Src enhances WNK4-mediated inhibition of ROMK channels by suppressing the SGK1-induced phosphorylation. This notion is also supported by the observation that c-Src was not able to modulate the interaction between SGK1 and WNK4 mutants (WNK4(S1169A) or WNK4(S1169D)) in which an SGK1-phosphorylation site (serine 1169) was mutated by alanine or aspartate. We conclude that c-Src inhibits SGK1-mediated phosphorylation hereby restoring the WNK4-mediated inhibition of ROMK channels thus suppressing K secretion."

These proteins have well-defined roles in regulating entry into and exit from the cell cycle and also have cell cycle-independent roles in facilitating differentiation. Here we investigate the overlap between pocket protein's function during embryonic development by using conditional mutant alleles to generate Rb;p107 double-mutant embryos (DKOs) that develop in the absence of placental defects. These DKOs die between e13.5 and e14.5, much earlier than either the conditional Rb or the germline p107 single mutants, which survive to birth or are largely viable, respectively. Analyses of the e13.5 DKOs shows that p107 mutation exacerbates the phenotypes resulting from pRb loss in the central nervous system and lens, but not in the peripheral nervous system. In addition, these embryos exhibit novel phenotypes, including increased proliferation of blood vessel endothelial cells, and heart defects, including double-outlet right ventricle (DORV). The DORV is caused, at least in part, by a defect in blood vessel endothelial cells and/or heart mesenchymal cells. These findings demonstrate novel, overlapping functions for pRb and p107 in numerous murine tissues."

Ion adsorption to aqueous interfaces involving complex organic molecules is relevant to biology in connection with the familiar but incompletely understood Hofmeister effects. Here, we describe resonant UV second harmonic generation (SHG) studies of the strongly chaotropic thiocyanate ion adsorbed to the interface formed by water and a monolayer of dodecanol, wherein the Gibbs free energy of adsorption was determined to be -6.7 +/- 1.1 and -6.3 +/- 1.8 kJ/mol for sodium and potassium thiocyanate, respectively, coincident with the value determined for thiocyanate at the air/water interface. Interestingly, near 4 M and higher concentrations, the resonant SHG signal increases discontinuously, indicating a structural change in the interfacial region."

At the appropriate temperatures and density, dynamic density correlation functions in three and four spatial dimensions correspond nearly exactly. Dynamic heterogeneity, quantified through the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relationship, is weaker in four dimensions than in three. We discuss this in the context of recent theories for dynamical heterogeneity. Because dimensionality is a crucially important variable, our work adds a stringent test for emerging theories of glassy dynamics."

Very few cases of parvovirus induced hepatic failure have been reported in adults and fewer still have required liver transplantation. We report the case of a 55-year-old immunocompetent woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure after acute infection with Parvovirus B19 who subsequently underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. This is believed to be the first reported case in the literature in which an adult patient with fulminant hepatic failure associated with acute parvovirus B19 infection and without hematologic abnormalities has been identified prior to undergoing liver transplantation. This case suggests that Parvovirus B19 induced liver disease can affect adults, can occur in the absence of hematologic abnormalities and can be severe enough to require liver transplantation."
17667950,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Human UPF1 participates in small RNA-induced mRNA downregulation.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous antisense regulators that trigger endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage, translational repression, and/or mRNA decay. miRNA-mediated gene regulation is important for numerous biological pathways, yet the underlying mechanisms are still under rigorous investigation. Here we identify human UPF1 (hUPF1) as a protein that contributes to RNA silencing. When hUPF1 is knocked down, miRNA targets are upregulated. The depletion of hUPF1 also increases the off-target messages of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are imperfectly complementary to transfected siRNAs. Conversely, when overexpressed, wild-type hUPF1 downregulates miRNA targets. The helicase domain mutant of hUPF1 fails to suppress miRNA targets. hUPF1 interacts with human Argonaute 1 (hAGO1) and hAGO2 and colocalizes with hAGO1 and hAGO2 in processing bodies, which are known to be the sites for translational repression and mRNA destruction. We further find that the amounts of target messages bound to hAGO2 are reduced when hUPF1 is depleted. Our data thus suggest that hUPF1 may participate in RNA silencing by facilitating the binding of the RNA-induced silencing complex to the target and by accelerating the decay of the mRNA."

However, the role of type 3 fimbriae in K. pneumoniae virulence has not been evaluated by use of in vivo infection models. In this study, the type 3 fimbrial gene cluster (mrk) of the clinical isolate C3091 is described in detail. The mrk gene cluster was revealed to be localized in close proximity to the type 1 fimbrial gene cluster. Thus, a 20.4-kb fimbria-encoding region was identified and found to be highly conserved among different K. pneumoniae isolates. Interestingly, a homologue to PecS, known as a global regulator of virulence in Erwinia chrysanthemi, was identified in the fimbria-encoding region. Comparison to the previously characterized plasmid encoded mrk gene cluster revealed significant differences, and it is established here that the putative regulatory gene mrkE is not a part of the chromosomally encoded type 3 fimbrial gene cluster. To evaluate the role of type 3 fimbriae in virulence, a type 3 fimbria mutant and a type 1 and type 3 fimbria double mutant was constructed. Type 3 fimbria expression was found to strongly promote biofilm formation. However, the fimbria mutants were as effective at colonizing the intestine as the wild type, and their virulence was not attenuated in a lung infection model. Also, in a urinary tract infection model, type 3 fimbriae did not influence the virulence, whereas type 1 fimbriae were verified as an essential virulence factor. Thus, type 3 fimbriae were established not to be a virulence factor in uncomplicated K. pneumoniae infections. However, since type 3 fimbriae promote biofilm formation, their role in development of infections in catheterized patients needs to be elucidated."

However, the sensitivity of influenza A virus subtypes/strains to PML is unknown. We investigated the role of PML in the replication of different influenza A virus subtypes/strains using pan-PML knock-down A549 cells and PML-VI-overexpressed MDCK cells. We found that (i) depletion of pan-PML by siRNA rendered A549 cells more susceptible to influenza A virus strains PR8(H1N1) and ST364(H3N2), but not to strains ST1233(H1N1), Qa199(H9N2) and Ph2246(H9N2); (ii) overexpression of PML-VI in MDCK cells conferred potent resistance to PR8(H1N1) infection, while lacked inhibitory activity to ST1233(H1N1), ST364(H3N2), Qa199(H9N2) and Ph2246(H9N2).

Commun.,372516,2009,A novel interaction between human DNA polymerase eta and MutLalpha.,"Human DNA polymerase eta (Poleta) is the gene product underlying xeroderma pigmentosum variant, and plays principal roles in translesion DNA synthesis. Here, we identified human MLH1, an essential component of mismatch repair (MMR), as a Poleta-interacting protein. The middle area residues, which include the little finger domain, of Poleta are important for the interaction with MLH1. Poleta also interacts with the MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer (MutLalpha). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that MutLalpha, and also MSH2 and MSH6, components of the MutSalpha heterodimer, form complexes with Poleta in human cells. Although MutSalpha had been reported to interact with C-terminal residues of Poleta, MutLalpha and MutSalpha co-precipitated with C-terminally truncated Poleta, suggesting that MutSalpha can interact with Poleta through MutLalpha. MMR proteins were more abundant in the Poleta complex on the chromatin of S phase-synchronized cells than of asynchronous cells, suggesting that the interaction between Poleta and MLH1 is involved in DNA replication."
17673910,1,Cell,413066,2009,Synaptotagmin-mediated bending of the target membrane is a critical step in Ca(2+)-regulated fusion.,"Decades ago it was proposed that exocytosis involves invagination of the target membrane, resulting in a highly localized site of contact between the bilayers destined to fuse. The vesicle protein synaptotagmin-I (syt) bends membranes in response to Ca(2+), but whether this drives localized invagination of the target membrane to accelerate fusion has not been determined. Previous studies relied on reconstituted vesicles that were already highly curved and used mutations in syt that were not selective for membrane-bending activity. Here, we directly address this question by utilizing vesicles with different degrees of curvature. A tubulation-defective syt mutant was able to promote fusion between highly curved SNARE-bearing liposomes but exhibited a marked loss of activity when the membranes were relatively flat. Moreover, bending of flat membranes by adding an N-BAR domain rescued the function of the tubulation-deficient syt mutant. Hence, syt-mediated membrane bending is a critical step in membrane fusion."
17675404,1,BMC Biochem.,101084098,2009,Identification of a nuclear localization motif in the serine/arginine protein kinase PSRPK of physarum polycephalum.,"BACKGROUND: Serine/arginine (SR) protein-specific kinases (SRPKs) are conserved in a wide range of organisms, from humans to yeast. Studies showed that SRPKs can regulate the nuclear import of SR proteins in cytoplasm, and regulate the sub-localization of SR proteins in the nucleus. But no nuclear localization signal (NLS) of SRPKs was found. We isolated an SRPK-like protein PSRPK (GenBank accession No. DQ140379) from Physarum polycephalum previously, and identified a NLS of PSRPK in this study. RESULTS: We carried out a thorough molecular dissection of the different domains of the PSRPK protein involved in its nuclear localization. By truncation of PSRPK protein, deletion of and single amino acid substitution in a putative NLS and transfection of mammalian cells, we observed the distribution of PSRPK fluorescent fusion protein in mammalian cells using confocal microscopy and found that the protein was mainly accumulated in the nucleus; this indicated that the motif contained a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Further investigation with truncated PSPRK peptides showed that the NLS (318PKKGDKYDKTD328) was localized in the alkaline Omega-loop of a helix-loop-helix motif (HLHM) of the C-terminal conserved domain. If the 318PKKGDK322 sequence was deleted from the loop or K320 was mutated to T320, the PSRPK fluorescent fusion protein could not enter and accumulate in the nucleus. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the 318PKKGDKYDKTD328 peptides localized in the C-terminal conserved domain of PSRPK with the Omega-loop structure could play a crucial role in the NLS function of PSRPK."
17675517,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar acid trehalase is targeted at the cell surface for its physiological function.,"Previous studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have proposed a vacuolar localization for Ath1, which is difficult to reconcile with its ability to hydrolyze exogenous trehalose. We used fluorescent microscopy to show that the red fluorescent protein mCherry fused to the C-terminus of Ath1, although mostly localized in the vacuole, was also targeted to the cell surface. Also, hybrid Ath1 truncates fused at their C-terminus with the yeast internal invertase revealed that a 131 amino acid N-terminal fragment of Ath1was sufficient to target the fusion protein to the cell surface, enabling growth of the suc2Delta mutant on sucrose. The unique transmembrane domain appeared to be indispensable for the production of a functional Ath1, and its removal abrogated invertase secretion and growth on sucrose. Finally, the physiological significance of the cell-surface localization of Ath1 was established by showing that fusion of the signal peptide of invertase to N-terminal truncated Ath1 allowed the ath1Delta mutant to grow on trehalose, whereas the signal sequence of the vacuolar-targeted Pep4 constrained Ath1 in the vacuole and prevented growth of this mutant on trehalose. Use of trafficking mutants that impaired Ath1 delivery to the vacuole abrogated neither its activity nor its growth on exogenous trehalose."

In vitro, HCT-1026 retained the cyclooxygenase inhibitory and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug activity of flurbiprofen, but at concentrations at which levels of amyloid-beta 1-42 amino acid were lowered by flurbiprofen, amyloid-beta 1-42 amino acid levels were elevated 200% by HCT-1026. Conversely, at lower concentrations, HCT-1026 behaved as a selective amyloid lowering agent with greater potency than flurbiprofen. The difference in concentration-responses between flurbiprofen and HCT-1026 in vitro suggests different cellular targets; and in no case did a combination of nitrate drug with flurbiprofen provide similar actions. In vivo, HCT-1026 was observed to reverse cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine in two behavioral assays; activity that was also shown by a classical nitrate drug, but not by flurbiprofen. The ability to restore aversive memory and spatial working and reference memory after cholinergic blockade has been demonstrated by other agents that stimulate NO/cGMP signaling. These observations add positively to the preclinical profile of HCT-1026 and NO chimeras in Alzheimer's disease."

Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma presenting with radiological characteristics of focal nodular hyperplasia.,"Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare tumor type containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately mixed. Although these tumors are usually considered to be more related to hepatocellular carcinoma than to cholangiocarcinoma, they sometimes, in contrast to hepatocellular carcinoma, contain a significant amount of fibrous stroma. This might in some cases explain atypical radiological features. We report a case of a cHCC-CC in a 47-year-old female that resembled focal nodular hyperplasia on Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Correlation of imaging and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein and CA19.9 can help to make the correct diagnosis preoperatively."
17683942,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Anti-microbial antibodies in celiac disease: trick or treat?,"AIM: To determine the prevalence of a new set of anti-glycan and anti-outer membrane protein (anti-OMP) antibodies in a Hungarian cohort of adult Celiac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: 190 consecutive CD patients [M/F: 71/119, age:39.9 (SD:14.1) years], 100 healthy, and 48 gastrointestinal controls were tested for glycan anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA), anti-laminaribioside (ALCA), anti-chitobioside, anti-mannobioside, anti-OMP antibodies and major NOD2/CARD15 mutations. Thirty out of 82 CD patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis were re-evaluated for the same antibodies after longstanding gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: 65.9% of the CD patients were positive for at least one of the tested antibodies at the time of the diagnosis. Except anti-OMP and ALCA, anti-microbial antibodies were exclusively seen in untreated CD; however, the overall sensitivity was low. Any glycan positivity (LR+: 3.13; 95% CI: 2.08-4.73) was associated with an increased likelihood ratio for diagnosing CD. Significant correlation was found between the levels of anti-glycan and anti-endomysial or anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Anti-glycan positivity was lost after longstanding GFD. Anti-glycan antibody titers were associated with symptoms at presentation, but not the presence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations. Patients with severe malabsorption more frequently had multiple antibodies at diagnosis (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-glycan antibodies in CD seems to be secondary to the impaired small bowel mucosa which can lead to increased antigen presentation. Furthermore, anti-glycan positivity may be considered an additional marker of CD and dietary adherence."
17690294,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Genome-wide transcriptional response of Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis to infection with the deadly chytrid fungus.,"Emerging infectious diseases are of great concern for both wildlife and humans. Several highly virulent fungal pathogens have recently been discovered in natural populations, highlighting the need for a better understanding of fungal-vertebrate host-pathogen interactions. Because most fungal pathogens are not fatal in the absence of other predisposing conditions, host-pathogen dynamics for deadly fungal pathogens are of particular interest. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter Bd) infects hundreds of species of frogs in the wild. It is found worldwide and is a significant contributor to the current global amphibian decline. However, the mechanism by which Bd causes death in amphibians, and the response of the host to Bd infection, remain largely unknown. Here we use whole-genome microarrays to monitor the transcriptional responses to Bd infection in the model frog species, Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis, which is susceptible to chytridiomycosis. To elucidate the immune response to Bd and evaluate the physiological effects of chytridiomycosis, we measured gene expression changes in several tissues (liver, skin, spleen) following exposure to Bd. We detected a strong transcriptional response for genes involved in physiological processes that can help explain some clinical symptoms of chytridiomycosis at the organismal level. However, we detected surprisingly little evidence of an immune response to Bd exposure, suggesting that this susceptible species may not be mounting efficient innate and adaptive immune responses against Bd. The weak immune response may be partially explained by the thermal conditions of the experiment, which were optimal for Bd growth. However, many immune genes exhibited decreased expression in Bd-exposed frogs compared to control frogs, suggesting a more complex effect of Bd on the immune system than simple temperature-mediated immune suppression. This study generates important baseline data for ongoing efforts to understand differences in response to Bd between susceptible and resistant frog species and the effects of chytridiomycosis in natural populations."
17690688,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Identification of keratinocyte growth factor as a target of microRNA-155 in lung fibroblasts: implication in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are critical in regulating many aspects of vertebrate embryo development, and for the maintenance of homeostatic equilibrium in adult tissues. The interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme are believed to be mediated by paracrine signals such as cytokines and extracellular matrix components secreted from fibroblasts that affect adjacent epithelia. In this study, we sought to identify the repertoire of microRNAs (miRNAs) in normal lung human fibroblasts and their potential regulation by the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and TGF-beta. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MiR-155 was significantly induced by inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta while it was down-regulated by TGF-beta. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in human fibroblasts induced modulation of a large set of genes related to &quot;cell to cell signalling&quot;, &quot;cell morphology&quot; and &quot;cellular movement&quot;. This was consistent with an induction of caspase-3 activity and with an increase in cell migration in fibroblasts tranfected with miR-155. Using different miRNA bioinformatic target prediction tools, we found a specific enrichment for miR-155 predicted targets among the population of down-regulated transcripts. Among fibroblast-selective targets, one interesting hit was keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-7), a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which owns two potential binding sites for miR-155 in its 3'-UTR. Luciferase assays experimentally validated that miR-155 can efficiently target KGF 3'-UTR. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that only one out of the 2 potential sites was truly functional. Functional in vitro assays experimentally validated that miR-155 can efficiently target KGF 3'-UTR. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using a mouse model of lung fibrosis showed that miR-155 expression level was correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly suggest a physiological function of miR-155 in lung fibroblasts. Altogether, this study implicates this miRNA in the regulation by mesenchymal cells of surrounding lung epithelium, making it a potential key player during tissue injury."
17690690,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Transgenic CHD1L expression in mouse induces spontaneous tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Amplification of 1q21 is the most frequent genetic alteration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was detected in 58-78% of primary HCC cases by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Using chromosome microdissection/hybrid selection approach we recently isolated a candidate oncogene CHD1L from 1q21 region. Our previous study has demonstrated that CHD1L had strong oncogenic ability, which could be effectively suppressed by siRNA against CHD1L. The molecular mechanism of CHD1L in tumorigenesis has been associated with its role in promoting cell proliferation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To further investigate the in vivo oncogenic role of CHD1L, CHD1L ubiquitous-expression transgenic mouse model was generated. Spontaneous tumor formations were found in 10/41 (24.4%) transgenic mice, including 4 HCCs, but not in their 39 wild-type littermates. In addition, alcohol intoxication was used to induce hepatocyte pathological lesions and results found that overexpression of CHD1L in hepatocytes could promote tumor susceptibility in CHD1L-transgenic mice. To address the mechanism of CHD1L in promoting cell proliferation, DNA content between CHD1L-transgenic and wildtype mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) was compared by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry results found that CHD1L could facilitate DNA synthesis and G1/S transition through the up-regulation of Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, CDK2, and CDK4, and down-regulation of Rb, p27(Kip1), and p53. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our data strongly support that CHD1L is a novel oncogene and plays an important role in HCC pathogenesis."
17693538,1,Nature,410462,2009,Co-translational mRNA decay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"The rates of RNA decay and transcription determine the steady-state levels of all messenger RNA and both can be subject to regulation. Although the details of transcriptional regulation are becoming increasingly understood, the mechanism(s) controlling mRNA decay remain unclear. In yeast, a major pathway of mRNA decay begins with deadenylation followed by decapping and 5'-3' exonuclease digestion. Importantly, it is hypothesized that ribosomes must be removed from mRNA before transcripts are destroyed. Contrary to this prediction, here we show that decay takes place while mRNAs are associated with actively translating ribosomes. The data indicate that dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA is not a prerequisite for decay and we suggest that the 5'-3' polarity of mRNA degradation has evolved to ensure that the last translocating ribosome can complete translation."
17699755,1,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,Singapore Genome Variation Project: a haplotype map of three Southeast Asian populations.,"The Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) provides a publicly available resource of 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 268 individuals from the Chinese, Malay, and Indian population groups in Southeast Asia. This online database catalogs information and summaries on genotype and phased haplotype data, including allele frequencies, assessment of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and recombination rates in a format similar to the International HapMap Project. Here, we introduce this resource and describe the analysis of human genomic variation upon agglomerating data from the HapMap and the Human Genome Diversity Project, providing useful insights into the population structure of the three major population groups in Asia. In addition, this resource also surveyed across the genome for variation in regional patterns of LD between the HapMap and SGVP populations, and for signatures of positive natural selection using two well-established metrics: iHS and XP-EHH. The raw and processed genetic data, together with all population genetic summaries, are publicly available for download and browsing through a web browser modeled with the Generic Genome Browser."
17702749,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Tetracycline-associated transcriptional regulation of transfer genes of the Bacteroides conjugative transposon CTnDOT.,"Many human colonic Bacteroides spp. harbor a conjugative transposon, CTnDOT, which carries two antibiotic resistance genes, tetQ and ermF. A distinctive feature of CTnDOT is that its excision and transfer are stimulated by tetracycline. Regulation of the genes responsible for excision has been described previously. We provide here the first characterization of the regulation of CTnDOT transfer (tra) genes. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the region containing the tra genes showed that these genes are regulated at the transcriptional level. Surprisingly, increased production of tra gene mRNA in tetracycline-stimulated cells was mediated by the proteins encoded by the excision genes. Previous studies have shown that expression of the excision gene operon is controlled by the regulatory protein RteC. Accordingly, it was possible that RteC was also regulating tra gene expression and that the excision proteins were only accessory proteins. However, placing the excision gene operon under the control of a heterologous promoter showed that the excision proteins alone could activate tra gene expression and that RteC was not directly involved. We also found a second level of tra gene control. The transfer of CTnDOT was inhibited by a DNA segment that included only a portion of the 3' end of one of the excision genes (exc). This segment contained a small open reading frame, rteR. By replacing the codons encoding the first two amino acids of the putative protein product of this open reading frame with stop codons, we showed that the rteR gene might encode a small regulatory RNA. RteR acted in trans to reduce the number of tra transcripts in a way that was independent of the excision proteins. The repressive effect of RteR was not the result of decreased stability of the tra mRNA. Instead, RteR appears to be modulating the level of tra gene expression in some more direct fashion. The complex regulatory system that controls and links the expression of CTnDOT excision and transfer genes may be designed to ensure stable maintenance of CTnDOT in nature by reducing the fitness toll it takes on the cell that harbors it."
17703188,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Ovol2 suppresses cell cycling and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes by directly repressing c-Myc and Notch1.,"Ovol2 belongs to the Ovo family of evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factors that act downstream of key developmental signaling pathways including Wg/Wnt and BMP/TGF-beta. We previously reported Ovol2 expression in the basal layer of epidermis, where epidermal stem/progenitor cells reside. In this work, we use HaCaT human keratinocytes to investigate the cellular and molecular functions of Ovol2. We show that depletion of Ovol2 leads to transient cell expansion but a loss of cells with long term proliferation potential. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings suggest that both faster cycling and precocious withdrawal from the cell cycle underlie this phenotype. Ovol2 depletion also accelerates extracellular signal-induced terminal differentiation in two- and three-dimensional culture models. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter, and functional rescue assays, we demonstrate that Ovol2 directly represses two critical downstream targets, c-Myc and Notch1, thereby suppressing keratinocyte transient proliferation and terminal differentiation, respectively. These findings shed light on how an epidermal cell maintains a proliferation-competent and differentiation-resistant state."
17703191,1,Virology,110674,2009,The stability of the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein is E6AP dependent.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoproteins target numerous cellular proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In the case of p53 this is mediated by the E6AP ubiquitin ligase. However, there are conflicting reports concerning how central E6AP is to the global function of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 oncoproteins. To investigate this further we have analysed the effects of E6AP removal upon the stability of endogenously expressed E6 protein. We show that when E6AP is silenced in HPV-positive cells, E6 protein levels are dramatically decreased in a proteasome-dependent manner. Further, we show that when E6AP is depleted in HeLa cells, E6 has a greatly decreased half-life. In addition, overexpression of E6AP stabilises ectopically expressed HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 in a manner that is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity. These results demonstrate that the stability of HPV E6 is critically dependent upon the presence of E6AP."
17704303,1,Immunity,9432918,2009,A role for lipid bodies in the cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens by MHC class I in dendritic cells.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have the striking ability to cross-present exogenous antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I to CD8(+) T cells. However, the intracellular pathways underlying cross-presentation remain ill defined. Current models involve cytosolic proteolysis of antigens by the proteasome and peptide import into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or phagosomal lumen by the transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and TAP2). Here, we show that DCs expressed an ER-resident 47 kDa immune-related GTPase, Igtp (Irgm3). Igtp resides on ER and lipid body (LB) membranes where it binds the LB coat component ADFP. Inactivation of genes encoding for either Igtp or ADFP led to defects in LB formation in DCs and severely impaired cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens to CD8(+) T cells but not antigen presentation to CD4(+) T cells. We thus define a new role for LB organelles in regulating cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to CD8(+) T lymphocytes in DCs."
17709393,1,BMC Dev. Biol.,100966973,2009,Selenoprotein N is dynamically expressed during mouse development and detected early in muscle precursors.,"BACKGROUND: In humans, mutations in the SEPN1 gene, encoding selenoprotein N (SelN), are involved in early onset recessive neuromuscular disorders, referred to as SEPN1-related-myopathies. The mechanisms behind these pathologies are poorly understood since the function of SelN remains elusive. However, previous results obtained in humans and more recently in zebrafish pointed to a potential role for SelN during embryogenesis. Using qRT-PCR, Western blot and whole mount in situ hybridization, we characterized in detail the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the murine Sepn1 gene during development, focusing particularly on skeletal muscles. RESULTS: In whole embryos, Sepn1 transcripts were detected as early as E5.5, with expression levels peaking at E12.5, and then strongly decreasing until birth. In isolated tissues, only mild transcriptional variations were observed during development, whereas a striking reduction of the protein expression was detected during the perinatal period. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sepn1 is expressed early in somites and restricted to the myotome, the sub-ectodermal mesenchyme and the dorsal root ganglia at mid-gestation stages. Interestingly, Sepn1 deficiency did not alter somitogenesis in embryos, suggesting that SelN is dispensable for these processes in mouse. CONCLUSION: We characterized for the first time the expression pattern of Sepn1 during mammalian embryogenesis and we demonstrated that its differential expression is most likely dependent on major post-transcriptional regulations. Overall, our data strongly suggest a potential role for selenoprotein N from mid-gestation stages to the perinatal period. Interestingly, its specific expression pattern could be related to the current hypothesis that selenoprotein N may regulate the activity of the ryanodine receptors."
17709753,1,Genome Biol.,100960660,2009,Community-wide analysis of microbial genome sequence signatures.,"BACKGROUND: Analyses of DNA sequences from cultivated microorganisms have revealed genome-wide, taxa-specific nucleotide compositional characteristics, referred to as genome signatures. These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to which environmental factors shape them. RESULTS: We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities, including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and low-abundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing &lt; 50 to 60% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome-wide. Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH approximately 5) versus extracellular (pH approximately 1) environment were small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is the result of genome-specific mutational biases. CONCLUSIONS: An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities. Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning of microbial communities."
17711851,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,p3d--Python module for structural bioinformatics.,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High-throughput bioinformatic analysis tools are needed to mine the large amount of structural data via knowledge based approaches. The development of such tools requires a robust interface to access the structural data in an easy way. For this the Python scripting language is the optimal choice since its philosophy is to write an understandable source code. RESULTS: p3d is an object oriented Python module that adds a simple yet powerful interface to the Python interpreter to process and analyse three dimensional protein structure files (PDB files). p3d's strength arises from the combination of a) very fast spatial access to the structural data due to the implementation of a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, b) set theory and c) functions that allow to combine a and b and that use human readable language in the search queries rather than complex computer language. All these factors combined facilitate the rapid development of bioinformatic tools that can perform quick and complex analyses of protein structures. CONCLUSION: p3d is the perfect tool to quickly develop tools for structural bioinformatics using the Python scripting language."
17711858,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Identification of a domain which affects kinetics and antagonistic potency of clozapine at 5-HT3 receptors.,"The widely used atypical antipsychotic clozapine is a potent competitive antagonist at 5-HT(3) receptors which may contribute to its unique psychopharmacological profile. Clozapine binds to 5-HT(3) receptors of various species. However, the structural requirements of the respective binding site for clozapine remain to be determined. Differences in the primary sequences within the 5-HT(3A) receptor gene in schizophrenic patients may result in an alteration of the antipsychotic potency and/or the side effect profile of clozapine. To determine these structural requirements we constructed chimeras with different 5-HT(3A) receptor sequences of murine and human origin and expressed these mutants in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Clozapine antagonises recombinant mouse 5-HT(3A) receptors with higher potency compared to recombinant human 5-HT(3A) receptors. 5-HT activation curves and clozapine inhibition curves yielded the parameters EC(50) and IC(50) for all receptors tested in the range of 0.6 - 2.7 microM and 1.5 - 83.3 nM, respectively. The use of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to calculate the dissociation constant K(b) values for clozapine revealed that an extracellular sequence (length 86 aa) close to the transmembrane domain M1 strongly determines the binding affinity of clozapine. K(b) values of clozapine were significantly lower (0.3-1.1 nM) for receptors containing the murine sequence and higher when compared with receptors containing the respective human sequence (5.8-13.4 nM). Thus, individual differences in the primary sequence of 5-HT(3) receptors may be crucial for the antipsychotic potency and/or the side effect profile of clozapine."
17717527,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,A non-redundant role for MKP5 in limiting ROS production and preventing LPS-induced vascular injury.,"There are at least 11 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) and only 3 major groups of MAPKs, raising the question of whether these phosphatases have non-redundant functions in vivo. Using a modified mouse model of local Shwartzman reaction, we found that deletion of the MKP5 gene, but not the MKP1 gene, led to robust and accelerated vascular inflammatory responses to a single dose of LPS injection. Depletion of neutrophils significantly reduced the vascular injury in Mkp5(-/-) mice, whereas adoptive transfer of Mkp5(-/-) neutrophils replicated the LPS-induced skin lesions in wild-type recipients. Neutrophils isolated from Mkp5(-/-) mice exhibited augmented p38 MAPK activation and increased superoxide generation on activation. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, significantly reduced p47(phox) phosphorylation and diminished superoxide production in neutrophils. p38 MAPK phosphorylated mouse p47(phox), and deletion of the p47(phox) gene ablated the LPS-induced vascular injury in Mkp5(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results show an earlier unrecognized and non-redundant function of MKP5 in restraining p38 MAPK-mediated neutrophil oxidant production, thereby preventing LPS-induced vascular injury."
17717528,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,Efficient regulation of VEGF expression by promoter-targeted lentiviral shRNAs based on epigenetic mechanism: a novel example of epigenetherapy.,"RATIONALE: We studied a possibility that shRNAs can lead to transcriptional gene activation at the promoter level via epigenetic mechanism. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) expression by promoter targeted small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in vitro and in experimental animals in vivo using stable local lentiviral gene transfer. METHODS AND RESULTS: One shRNA was identified which strongly increased VEGF-A expression in C166 endothelial cells at mRNA and protein level whereas another shRNA decreased VEGF-A expression. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the repressing shRNA caused epigenetic changes, which increased nucleosome density within the promoter and transcription start site and led to repression of VEGF-A expression. Epigenetic changes caused by the activating shRNA were opposite to those caused by the repressing shRNA. These results were confirmed in vivo in an ischemic mouse hindlimb model after local gene transfer where VEGF-A upregulation achieved by promoter-targeted shRNA increased vascularity and blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: We show that lentivirus-mediated delivery of shRNA molecules targeted to specific regions in the mVEGF-A promoter either induce or repress VEGF-A expression via epigenetic modulation. Thus, we describe a new approach of gene therapy, epigenetherapy, based on an epigenetic mechanism at the promoter level. Controlling transcription through manipulation of specific epigenetic marks provides a novel approach for the treatment of several diseases."
17717529,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Novel LC8 mutations have disparate effects on the assembly and stability of flagellar complexes.,"LC8 functions as a dimer crucial for a variety of molecular motors and non-motor complexes. Emerging models, founded on structural studies, suggest that the LC8 dimer promotes the stability and refolding of dimeric target proteins in molecular complexes, and its interactions with selective target proteins, including dynein subunits, is regulated by LC8 phosphorylation, which is proposed to prevent LC8 dimerization. To test these hypotheses in vivo, we determine the impacts of two new LC8 mutations on the assembly and stability of defined LC8-containing complexes in Chlamydomonas flagella. The three types of dyneins and the radial spoke are disparately affected by dimeric LC8 with a C-terminal extension. The defects include the absence of specific subunits, complex instability, and reduced incorporation into the axonemal super complex. Surprisingly, a phosphomimetic LC8 mutation, which is largely monomeric in vitro, is still dimeric in vivo and does not significantly change flagellar generation and motility. The differential defects in these flagellar complexes support the structural model and indicate that modulation of target proteins by LC8 leads to the proper assembly of complexes and ultimately higher level complexes. Furthermore, the ability of flagellar complexes to incorporate the phosphomimetic LC8 protein and the modest defects observed in the phosphomimetic LC8 mutant suggest that LC8 phosphorylation is not an effective mechanism for regulating molecular complexes."
17717530,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Reduction of lysyl hydroxylase 3 causes deleterious changes in the deposition and organization of extracellular matrix.,"Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) is a multifunctional enzyme possessing lysyl hydroxylase, collagen galactosyltransferase, and glucosyltransferase (GGT) activities. We report here an important role for LH3 in the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeleton. Deposition of ECM was affected in heterozygous LH3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF(+/-)) and in skin fibroblasts collected from a member of a Finnish epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) family known to be deficient in GGT activity. We show the GGT deficiency to be due to a transcriptional defect in one LH3 allele. The ECM abnormalities also lead to defects in the arrangement of the cytoskeleton in both cell lines. Ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in the skin of heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice indicating that even a moderate decrease in LH3 has deleterious consequences in vivo. The LH3 null allele in the EBS family member and the resulting abnormalities in the organization of the extracellular matrix, similar to those found in MEF(+/-), may explain the correlation between the severity of the phenotype and the decrease in GGT activity reported in this family."
17719541,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,"Roles of mammalian structural units, ligand cluster and polyvalency in the Abrus precatorius agglutinin and glycoprotein recognition process.","Previous studies on one of the toxic type 2 ribosome inactivating proteins (RIP), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA), have shown that the recognition domains of APA are restricted to monomers of Galbeta1-3GalNAc (T, Thomsen-Friedenreich glycotope) and Galbeta1-3/4GlcNAc (blood group precursor type I/II sequences); which are essential but play a minor role in the recognition process. In this study, APA recognition factors were expanded to include ligand clusters and polyvalent glycotopes by enzyme-linked lectinosorbent binding and inhibition assays. Based on the results of molar relative potency, the essential mammalian structural units are Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha/beta1- (T(alpha)/T(beta))&gt;Galalpha1-4Gal (E)&gt;Galbeta1-3/4GlcNAc (I/II) and avidity for tri-/di-antennary II(beta), T, E and II monomers was found to be 7.1 x 10(2), 4.0, 5.5, 3.7 and 2.4 times higher than monomeric Gal. Among natural polyvalent glycotopes or clusters, high-density polyvalent T(alpha) and complex multivalent I(beta)/II(beta) glycotopes greatly enhanced the affinity for APA over 10(4) times. Based on these results, it is concluded that contribution of monomeric T(alpha), II(beta), I(beta), E(beta) and their clusters and polyvalency play critical roles in this recognition process. The binding intensities of these factors in decreasing order are: polyvalent T(alpha), II(beta)/I(beta) and E(beta)&gt;tri-antennary II(beta)&gt;monomeric T(alpha), T(beta), I and II&gt;Gal&gt;GalNAc (weak). As one of type 2 RIP lectins, these recognition factors of the B chain are likely to be crucial for attachment and endocytosis. A comparison of the differential recognition factors and combining sites of APA with those of other lectins (Ricinus communis agglutinin, RCA(1) and ricin) is also illustrated."
17721437,1,Virology,110674,2009,Affinity maturation by targeted diversification of the CDR-H2 loop of a monoclonal Fab derived from a synthetic naïve human antibody library and directed against the internal trimeric coiled-coil of gp41 yields a set of Fabs with improved HIV-1 neutralization potency and breadth.,"Previously we reported a broadly HIV-1 neutralizing mini-antibody (Fab 3674) of modest potency that was derived from a human non-immune phage library by panning against the chimeric gp41-derived construct N(CCG)-gp41. This construct presents the N-heptad repeat of the gp41 ectodomain as a stable, helical, disulfide-linked trimer that extends in helical phase from the six-helix bundle of gp41. In this paper, Fab 3674 was subjected to affinity maturation against the N(CCG)-gp41 antigen by targeted diversification of the CDR-H2 loop to generate a panel of Fabs with diverse neutralization activity. Three affinity-matured Fabs selected for further study, Fabs 8060, 8066 and 8068, showed significant increases in both potency and breadth of neutralization against HIV-1 pseudotyped with envelopes of primary isolates from the standard subtype B and C HIV-1 reference panels. The parental Fab 3674 is 10-20-fold less potent in monovalent than bivalent format over the entire B and C panels of HIV-1 pseudotypes. Of note is that the improved neutralization activity of the affinity-matured Fabs relative to the parental Fab 3674 was, on average, significantly greater for the Fabs in monovalent than bivalent format. This suggests that the increased avidity of the Fabs for the target antigen in bivalent format can be partially offset by kinetic and/or steric advantages afforded by the smaller monovalent Fabs. Indeed, the best affinity-matured Fab (8066) in monovalent format ( approximately 50 kDa) was comparable in HIV-1 neutralization potency to the parental Fab 3674 in bivalent format ( approximately 120 kDa) across the subtype B and C reference panels."
17721439,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,"Pleiotropic roles of calumenin (calu-1), a calcium-binding ER luminal protein, in Caenorhabditis elegans.","Calumenin is a Ca(2+) binding protein localizing at the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it has been implicated in various diseases, the in vivo functions of calumenin are largely unknown. Here, we report that calumenin has pleiotropic roles in muscle and cuticle function in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutant analysis revealed that the calu-1 is required for regulating fertility, locomotion and body size. In addition, calu-1 is important for two behaviors, defecation and pharyngeal pumping, consistent with its ability to bind Ca(2+). The genetic analysis further suggested the possibility that calu-1 regulates the pharyngeal pumping together with the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) receptor encoded by itr-1. Taken together, our data suggest that calumenin is important for calcium signaling pathways in C. elegans."
17721440,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,The association of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 with the neuronal Ca2+-binding protein 2 modulates receptor function.,"Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors mediate in part the CNS effects of glutamate. These receptors interact with a large array of intracellular proteins in which the final role is to regulate receptor function. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments we showed a close and specific interaction between mGlu(5) receptor and NECAB2 in both transfected human embryonic kidney cells and rat hippocampus. Interestingly, in pull-down experiments increasing concentrations of calcium drastically reduced the ability of these two proteins to interact, suggesting that NECAB2 binds to mGlu(5) receptor in a calcium-regulated manner. Immunoelectron microscopy detection of NECAB2 and mGlu(5) receptor in the rat hippocampal formation indicated that both proteins are codistributed in the same subcellular compartment of pyramidal cells. In addition, the NECAB2/mGlu(5) receptor interaction regulated mGlu(5b)-mediated activation of both inositol phosphate accumulation and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Overall, these findings indicate that NECAB2 by its physical interaction with mGlu(5b) receptor modulates receptor function."
17721441,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,A mutagenic analysis of the RNase mechanism of the bacterial Kid toxin by mass spectrometry.,"Kid, the toxin of the parD (kis, kid) maintenance system of plasmid R1, is an endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves RNA at the 5' of A in the core sequence 5'-UA(A/C)-3'. A model of the Kid toxin interacting with the uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3' is available. To evaluate this model, a significant collection of mutants in some of the key residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding (T46, A55, T69 and R85) or RNA cleavage (R73, D75 and H17) were analysed by mass spectrometry in RNA binding and cleavage assays. A pair of substrates, 5'-AUACA-3', and its uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3', used to establish the model and structure of the Kid-RNA complex, were used in both the RNA cleavage and binding assays. A second RNA substrate, 5'-UUACU-3' efficiently cleaved by Kid both in vivo and in vitro, was also used in the cleavage assays. Compared with the wild-type protein, mutations in the residues of the catalytic site abolished RNA cleavage without substantially altering RNA binding. Mutations in residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding show reduced binding efficiency and a corresponding decrease in RNA cleavage efficiency. The cleavage profiles of the different mutants were similar with the two substrates used, but RNA cleavage required much lower protein concentrations when the 5'-UUACU-3' substrate was used. Protein synthesis and growth assays are consistent with there being a correlation between the RNase activity of Kid and its inhibitory potential. These results give important support to the available models of Kid RNase and the Kid-RNA complex."
17721446,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Optimization of D-amino acid oxidase for low substrate concentrations--towards a cancer enzyme therapy.,"D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has recently become of interest as a biocatalyst for industrial applications and for therapeutic treatments. It has been used in gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies, in which its production of H2O2 in tumor cells can be regulated by administration of substrate. This approach is limited by the locally low O2 concentration and the high K(m) for this substrate. Using the directed evolution approach, one DAAO mutant was identified that has increased activity at low O2 and D-Ala concentrations and a 10-fold lower K(m) for O2. We report on the mechanism of this DAAO variant and on its cytotoxicity towards various mammalian cancer cell lines. The higher activity observed at low O2 and D-Ala concentrations results from a combination of modifications of specific kinetic steps, each being of small magnitude. These results highlight the potential in vivo applicability of this evolved mutant DAAO for tumor therapy."
17728244,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection of mallards with homo- and heterosubtypic immunity induced by low pathogenic avian influenza viruses.,"The potential role of wild birds as carriers of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 is still a matter of debate. Consecutive or simultaneous infections with different subtypes of influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV) are very common in wild duck populations. To better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infections in natural ecosystems, we investigated the influence of prior infection of mallards with homo- (H5N2) and heterosubtypic (H4N6) LPAIV on exposure to HPAIV H5N1. In mallards with homosubtypic immunity induced by LPAIV infection, clinical disease was absent and shedding of HPAIV from respiratory and intestinal tracts was grossly reduced compared to the heterosubtypic and control groups (mean GEC/100 microl at 3 dpi: 3.0 x 10(2) vs. 2.3 x 10(4) vs. 8.7 x 10(4); p&lt;0.05). Heterosubtypic immunity induced by an H4N6 infection mediated a similar but less pronounced effect. We conclude that the epidemiology of HPAIV H5N1 in mallards and probably other aquatic wild bird species is massively influenced by interfering immunity induced by prior homo- and heterosubtypic LPAIV infections."
17761173,1,Nature,410462,2009,In situ observation of incompressible Mott-insulating domains in ultracold atomic gases.,"The observation of the superfluid to Mott insulator phase transition of ultracold atoms in optical lattices was an enabling discovery in experimental many-body physics, providing the first tangible example of a quantum phase transition (one that occurs even at zero temperature) in an ultracold atomic gas. For a trapped gas, the spatially varying local chemical potential gives rise to multiple quantum phases within a single sample, complicating the interpretation of bulk measurements. Here we report spatially resolved, in-situ imaging of a two-dimensional ultracold atomic gas as it crosses the superfluid to Mott insulator transition, providing direct access to individual characteristics of the insulating, superfluid and normal phases. We present results for the local compressibility in all phases, observing a strong suppression in the insulator domain and suppressed density fluctuations for the Mott insulator, in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we obtain a direct measure of the finite temperature of the system. Taken together, these methods enable a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas, and of the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the quantum critical regime."
17761536,1,Nature,410462,2009,Modelling pathogenesis and treatment of familial dysautonomia using patient-specific iPSCs.,"The isolation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers a new strategy for modelling human disease. Recent studies have reported the derivation and differentiation of disease-specific human iPSCs. However, a key challenge in the field is the demonstration of disease-related phenotypes and the ability to model pathogenesis and treatment of disease in iPSCs. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare but fatal peripheral neuropathy, caused by a point mutation in the IKBKAP gene involved in transcriptional elongation. The disease is characterized by the depletion of autonomic and sensory neurons. The specificity to the peripheral nervous system and the mechanism of neuron loss in FD are poorly understood owing to the lack of an appropriate model system. Here we report the derivation of patient-specific FD-iPSCs and the directed differentiation into cells of all three germ layers including peripheral neurons. Gene expression analysis in purified FD-iPSC-derived lineages demonstrates tissue-specific mis-splicing of IKBKAP in vitro. Patient-specific neural crest precursors express particularly low levels of normal IKBKAP transcript, suggesting a mechanism for disease specificity. FD pathogenesis is further characterized by transcriptome analysis and cell-based assays revealing marked defects in neurogenic differentiation and migration behaviour. Furthermore, we use FD-iPSCs for validating the potency of candidate drugs in reversing aberrant splicing and ameliorating neuronal differentiation and migration. Our study illustrates the promise of iPSC technology for gaining new insights into human disease pathogenesis and treatment."
17762861,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,An ultra-short dopamine pathway regulates basal ganglia output.,"Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is a key basal ganglia output nucleus critical for movement control. Its GABA-containing projection neurons intermingle with nigral dopamine (DA) neuron dendrites. Here we show that SNr GABA neurons coexpress dopamine D(1) and D(5) receptor mRNAs and also mRNA for TRPC3 channels. Dopamine induced an inward current in these neurons and increased their firing frequency. These effects were mimicked by D(1)-like agonists, blocked by a D(1)-like antagonist. D(1)-like receptor blockade reduced SNr GABA neuron firing frequency and increased their firing irregularity. These D(1)-like effects were absent in D(1) or D(5) receptor knock-out mice and inhibited by intracellularly applied D(1) or D(5) receptor antibody. These D(1)-like effects were also inhibited when the tonically active TRPC3 channels were inhibited by intracellularly applied TRPC3 channel antibody. Furthermore, stimulation of DA neurons induced a direct inward current in SNr GABA neurons that was sensitive to D(1)-like blockade. Manipulation of DA neuron activity and DA release and inhibition of dopamine reuptake affected SNr GABA neuron activity in a D(1)-like receptor-dependent manner. Together, our findings indicate that dendritically released dopamine tonically excites SNr GABA neurons via D(1)-D(5) receptor coactivation that enhances constitutively active TRPC3 channels, forming an ultra-short substantia nigra pars compacta --&gt; SNr dopamine pathway that regulates the firing intensity and pattern of these basal ganglia output neurons."
17762864,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Serotonergic modulation of locomotion in zebrafish: endogenous release and synaptic mechanisms.,"Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in shaping the activity of the spinal networks underlying locomotion in many vertebrate preparations. At larval stages in zebrafish, 5-HT does not change the frequency of spontaneous swimming; and it only decreases the quiescent period between consecutive swimming episodes. However, it is not known whether 5-HT exerts similar actions on the locomotor network at later developmental stages. For this, the effect of 5-HT on the fictive locomotor pattern of juvenile and adult zebrafish was analyzed. Bath-application of 5-HT (1-20 mum) reduced the frequency of the NMDA-induced locomotor rhythm. Blocking removal from the synaptic cleft with the reuptake inhibitor citalopram had similar effects, suggesting that endogenous serotonin is modulating the locomotor pattern. One target for this modulation was the mid-cycle inhibition during locomotion because the IPSPs recorded in spinal neurons during the hyperpolarized phase were increased both in amplitude and occurrence by 5-HT. Similar results were obtained for IPSCs recorded in spinal neurons clamped at the reversal potential of excitatory currents (0 mV). 5-HT also slows down the rising phase of the excitatory drive recorded in spinal cord neurons when glycinergic inhibition is blocked. These results suggest that the decrease in the locomotor burst frequency induced by 5-HT is mediated by a potentiation of mid-cycle inhibition combined with a delayed onset of the subsequent depolarization."
17762865,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Executive function and attention are preserved in older surgically menopausal monkeys receiving estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone.,"Animal models of menopause have been used to further define the cognitive processes that respond to hormone therapy and to investigate parameters that may influence the cognitive effects of estrogen. Many investigations in animals have focused on memory; however, the effects of hormone therapy on executive function and attention processes have not been well studied. Thus, the purpose of this set of investigations was to assess the effects of estrogen therapy alone or with progesterone on executive and attention processes in middle-aged ovariectomized monkeys. Monkeys were preoperatively trained on a modified version of the Wisconsin card sort task and on a visual cued reaction time task. Hormone therapy was initiated at the time of ovariectomy and cognitive function was reassessed at 2, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Relative to monkeys receiving either of the estrogen therapies, monkeys receiving placebo were impaired in their ability to shift a cognitive set in the Wisconsin card sort task and were impaired in shifting visuospatial attention in the visual cued reaction time task. Our findings are consistent with clinical studies that indicate that hormone therapy can improve executive function and attention processes in postmenopausal women."
17762867,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Associative conditioning tunes transient dynamics of early olfactory processing.,"Odors evoke complex spatiotemporal responses in the insect antennal lobe (AL) and mammalian olfactory bulb. However, the behavioral relevance of spatiotemporal coding remains unclear. In the present work we combined behavioral analyses with calcium imaging of odor induced activity in the honeybee AL to evaluate the relevance of this temporal dimension in the olfactory code. We used a new way for evaluation of odor similarity of binary mixtures in behavioral studies, which involved testing whether a match of odor-sampling time is necessary between training and testing conditions for odor recognition during associative learning. Using graded changes in the similarity of the mixture ratios, we found high correlations between the behavioral generalization across those mixtures and a gradient of activation in AL output. Furthermore, short odor stimuli of 500 ms or less affected how well odors were matched with a memory template, and this time corresponded to a shift from a sampling-time-dependent to a sampling-time-independent memory. Accordingly, 375 ms corresponded to the time required for spatiotemporal AL activity patterns to reach maximal separation according to imaging studies. Finally, we compared spatiotemporal representations of binary mixtures in trained and untrained animals. AL activity was modified by conditioning to improve separation of odor representations. These data suggest that one role of reinforcement is to &quot;tune&quot; the AL such that relevant odors become more discriminable."
17762870,1,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Do distinct populations of dorsal root ganglion neurons account for the sensory peptidergic innervation of the kidney?,"Peptidergic afferent renal nerves (PARN) have been linked to kidney damage in hypertension and nephritis. Neither the receptors nor the signals controlling local release of neurokinines [calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP)] and signal transmission to the brain are well-understood. We tested the hypothesis that PARN, compared with nonrenal afferents (Non-RN), are more sensitive to acidic stimulation via transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels and exhibit a distinctive firing pattern. PARN were distinguished from Non-RN by fluorescent labeling (DiI) and studied by in vitro patch-clamp techniques in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG; T11-L2). Acid-induced currents or firing due to current injection or acidic superfusion were studied in 252 neurons, harvested from 12 Sprague-Dawley rats. PARN showed higher acid-induced currents than Non-RN (transient: 15.9 +/- 5.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.2* pA/pF at pH 6; sustained: 20.0 +/- 4.5 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.2* pA/pF at pH 5; *P &lt; 0.05). The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited sustained, amiloride-transient currents. Forty-eight percent of PARN were classified as tonic neurons (TN = sustained firing during current injection), and 52% were phasic (PN = transient firing). Non-RN were rarely tonic (15%), but more frequently phasic (85%), than PARN (P &lt; 0.001). TN were more frequently acid-sensitive than PN (50-70 vs. 2-20%, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, renal PN were more frequently acid-sensitive than nonrenal PN (20 vs. 2%, P &lt; 0.01). Confocal microscopy revealed innervation of renal vessels, tubules, and glomeruli by CGRP- and partly SP-positive fibers coexpressing TRPV1. Our data show that PARN are represented by a very distinct population of small-to-medium sized DRG neurons exhibiting more frequently tonic firing and TRPV1-mediated acid sensitivity. These very distinct DRG neurons might play a pivotal role in renal physiology and disease."
17785451,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,Identification of brain transcriptional variation reproduced in peripheral blood: an approach for mapping brain expression traits.,"Genome-wide gene expression studies may provide substantial insight into gene activities and biological pathways differing between tissues and individuals. We investigated such gene expression variation by analyzing expression profiles in brain tissues derived from eight different brain regions and from blood in 12 monkeys from a biomedically important non-human primate model, the vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). We characterized brain regional differences in gene expression, focusing on transcripts for which inter-individual variation of expression in brain correlates well with variation in blood from the same individuals. Using stringent criteria, we identified 29 transcripts whose expression is measurable, stable, replicable, variable between individuals, relevant to brain function and heritable. Polymorphisms identified in probe regions could, in a minority of transcripts, confound the interpretation of the observed inter-individual variation. The high heritability of levels of these transcripts in a large vervet pedigree validated our approach of focusing on transcripts that showed higher inter-individual compared with intra-individual variation. These selected transcripts are candidate expression Quantitative Trait Loci, differentially regulating transcript levels in the brain among individuals. Given the high degree of conservation of tissue expression profiles between vervets and humans, our findings may facilitate the understanding of regional and individual transcriptional variation and its genetic mechanisms in humans. The approach employed here-utilizing higher quality tissue and more precise dissection of brain regions than is usually possible in humans-may therefore provide a powerful means to investigate variation in gene expression relevant to complex brain related traits, including human neuropsychiatric diseases."
17785527,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,The N-terminal domain of Drosophila Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3) defines a novel family of fungal pattern recognition receptors.,"Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3), a pattern recognition receptor that circulates in the hemolymph of Drosophila, is responsible for sensing fungal infection and triggering Toll pathway activation. Here, we report that GNBP3 N-terminal domain binds to fungi upon identifying long chains of beta-1,3-glucans in the fungal cell wall as a major ligand. Interestingly, this domain fails to interact strongly with short oligosaccharides. The crystal structure of GNBP3-Nter reveals an immunoglobulin-like fold in which the glucan binding site is masked by a loop that is highly conserved among glucan-binding proteins identified in several insect orders. Structure-based mutagenesis experiments reveal an essential role for this occluding loop in discriminating between short and long polysaccharides. The displacement of the occluding loop is necessary for binding and could explain the specificity of the interaction with long chain structured polysaccharides. This represents a novel mechanism for beta-glucan recognition."

J.,101231645,2009,"Hepatitis B virus genotypes/subgenotypes in voluntary blood donors in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype appears to show varying geographic distribution. Molecular epidemiological study of HBV in particular areas in Indonesia is still limited. This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV genotype/subgenotype and mutations in basal core promoter (BCP) region in voluntary blood donors in Makassar, one of the biggest cities in east part of Indonesia. A total of 214 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive samples were enrolled in this study. HBV genotype/subgenotype was identified by genotype-specific PCR method or direct sequencing of pre-S region. Mutations in BCP were identified by direct sequencing of the corresponding region. RESULTS: HBV/B and HBV/C were detected in 61.21% and 25.23% of the samples, while mix of HBV/B and HBV/C was found in 12.62% of the samples. Based on pre-S region, among HBV/B and HBV/C, HBV/B3 (95.00%) and HBV/C1 (58.82%) were predominant. Interestingly, HBV/D was identified in two samples (22.165.07 and 22.252.07). Complete genome sequences of two HBV/D strains (22.165.07 and 22.252.07) demonstrated that both strains belong to HBV/D6, and the divergence between the two strains were 1.45%, while divergences of both 22.165.07 and 22.252.07 strains with reference strain (AM422939/France) were 2.67%. A1762T/G1764A mutation was observed in 1.96% and 5.36%, whereas T1753V mutation was found in 2.94% and 1.79% of HBV/B and HBV/C, respectively. CONCLUSION: HBV/B and HBV/C are dominant in Makassar, similar to most areas in Indonesia. Mutations in BCP which might be associated with severity of liver disease are less common."
17805343,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,A core MYC gene expression signature is prominent in basal-like breast cancer but only partially overlaps the core serum response.,"BACKGROUND: The MYC oncogene contributes to induction and growth of many cancers but the full spectrum of the MYC transcriptional response remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microarrays, we conducted a detailed kinetic study of genes that respond to MYCN or MYCNDeltaMBII induction in primary human fibroblasts. In parallel, we determined the response to steady state overexpression of MYCN and MYCNDeltaMBII in the same cell type. An overlapping set of 398 genes from the two protocols was designated a 'Core MYC Signature' and used for further analysis. Comparison of the Core MYC Signature to a published study of the genes induced by serum stimulation revealed that only 7.4% of the Core MYC Signature genes are in the Core Serum Response and display similar expression changes to both MYC and serum. Furthermore, more than 50% of the Core MYC Signature genes were not influenced by serum stimulation. In contrast, comparison to a panel of breast cancers revealed a strong concordance in gene expression between the Core MYC Signature and the basal-like breast tumor subtype, which is a subtype with poor prognosis. This concordance was supported by the higher average level of MYC expression in the same tumor samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The Core MYC Signature has clinical relevance as this profile can be used to deduce an underlying genetic program that is likely to contribute to a clinical phenotype. Therefore, the presence of the Core MYC Signature may predict clinical responsiveness to therapeutics that are designed to disrupt MYC-mediated phenotypes."

Cancer,370635,2009,A randomised phase III trial comparing gemcitabine with surgery-only in patients with resected pancreatic cancer: Japanese Study Group of Adjuvant Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This multicentre randomised phase III trial was designed to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine improves the outcomes of patients with resected pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included macroscopically curative resection of invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas and no earlier radiation or chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1 : 1 ratio to either the gemcitabine group or the surgery-only group. Patients assigned to the gemcitabine group received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg m(-2) over 30 min on days 1, 8 and 15, every 4 weeks for 3 cycles. RESULTS: Between April 2002 and March 2005, 119 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 118 were eligible and analysable (58 in the gemcitabine group and 60 in the surgery-only group). Both groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Although heamatological toxicity was frequently observed in the gemcitabine group, most toxicities were transient, and grade 3 or 4 non-heamatological toxicity was rare. Patients in the gemcitabine group showed significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than those in the surgery-only group (median DFS, 11.4 versus 5.0 months; hazard ratio=0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.89); P=0.01), although overall survival did not differ significantly between the gemcitabine and surgery-only groups (median overall survival, 22.3 versus 18.4 months; hazard ratio=0.77 (95% CI: 0.51-1.14); P=0.19). CONCLUSION: The current results suggest that adjuvant gemcitabine contributes to prolonged DFS in patients undergoing macroscopically curative resection of pancreatic cancer."
17850179,1,J. Clin. Invest.,7802877,2009,Aldosterone mediates activation of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter through an SGK1 and WNK4 signaling pathway.,"Aldosterone regulates volume homeostasis and blood pressure by enhancing sodium reabsorption in the kidney's distal nephron (DN). On the apical surface of these renal epithelia, aldosterone increases expression and activity of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). While the cellular mechanisms by which aldosterone regulates ENaC have been well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that link aldosterone to NCC-mediated Na+/Cl- reabsorption remain elusive. The serine/threonine kinase with-no-lysine 4 (WNK4) has previously been shown to reduce cell surface expression of NCC. Here we measured sodium uptake in a Xenopus oocyte expression system and found that serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1), an aldosterone-responsive gene expressed in the DN, attenuated the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on NCC activity. In addition, we showed--both in vitro and in a human kidney cell line--that SGK1 bound and phosphorylated WNK4. We found one serine located within an established SGK1 consensus target sequence, and the other within a motif that was, to our knowledge, previously uncharacterized. Mutation of these target serines to aspartate, in order to mimic phosphorylation, attenuated the effect of WNK4 on NCC activity in the Xenopus oocyte system. These data thus delineate what we believe to be a novel mechanism for aldosterone activation of NCC through SGK1 signaling of WNK4 kinase."
17850745,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,TGFBR1 haplotypes and risk of non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptors are centrally involved in TGF-beta-mediated cell growth and differentiation and are frequently inactivated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Constitutively decreased type I TGF-beta receptor (TGFBR1) expression is emerging as a novel tumor-predisposing phenotype. The association of TGFBR1 haplotypes with risk for NSCLC has not yet been studied. We tested the hypothesis that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and/or TGFBR1 haplotypes are associated with risk of NSCLC. We genotyped six TGFBR1 haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNP) by PCR-RFLP assays and one htSNP by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism assay in two case-control studies. Case-control study 1 included 102 NSCLC patients and 104 healthy controls from Suzhou. Case-control study 2 included 131 patients with NSCLC and 133 healthy controls from Wuxi. Individuals included in both case-control studies were Han Chinese. Haplotypes were reconstructed according to the genotyping data and linkage disequilibrium status of these seven htSNPs. None of the htSNP was associated with NSCLC risk in either study. However, a four-marker CTGC haplotype was significantly more common among controls than among cases in both studies (P = 0.014 and P = 0.010, respectively), indicating that this haplotype is associated with decreased NSCLC risk {adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.09 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.01-0.61] and 0.11 [95% CI, 0.02-0.59], respectively}. Combined analysis of both studies shows a strong association of this four-marker haplotype with decreased NSCLC risk (adjusted OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39). This is the first evidence of an association between a TGFBR1 haplotype and risk for NSCLC."
17853888,1,Proteomics,101092707,2009,Proteomic evaluation of wound-healing processes in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber tissue.,"Proteins from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber slices, related to the wound-healing process, were separated by 2-DE and identified by an MS analysis in MS and MS/MS mode. Slicing triggered differentiation processes that lead to changes in metabolism, activation of defence and cell-wall reinforcement. Proteins related to storage, cell growth and division, cell structure, signal transduction, energy production, disease/defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism were detected. Image analysis of the 2-DE gels revealed a time-dependent change in the complexity of the polypeptide patterns. By microscopic observation the polyalyphatic domain of suberin was clearly visible by D4, indicating that a closing layer (primary suberisation) was formed by then. A PCA of the six sampling dates revealed two time phases, D0-D2 and D4-D8, with a border position between D2 and D4. Moreover, a PCA of differentially expressed proteins indicated the existence of a succession of proteomic events leading to wound-periderm reconstruction. Some late-expressed proteins (D6-D8), including a suberisation-associated anionic peroxidase, have also been identified in the native periderm. Despite this, protein patterns of D8 slices and native periderm were still different, suggesting that the processes of wound-periderm formation are extended in time and not fully equivalent. The information presented in this study gives clues for further work on wound healing-periderm formation processes."
17853892,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Estimating sensitivity of laboratory testing for influenza in Canada through modelling.,"BACKGROUND: The weekly proportion of laboratory tests that are positive for influenza is used in public health surveillance systems to identify periods of influenza activity. We aimed to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The weekly number of influenza-negative tests from 1999 to 2006 was modelled as a function of laboratory-confirmed positive tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses, seasonality, and trend using Poisson regression. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32-34%), varying from 30-40% depending on the season and region. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated sensitivity of influenza tests reported to this national laboratory surveillance system is considerably less than reported test characteristics for most laboratory tests. A number of factors may explain this difference, including sample quality and specimen procurement issues as well as test characteristics. Improved diagnosis would permit better estimation of the burden of influenza."
17853893,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Comparison of two quantitative methods of discerning airspace enlargement in smoke-exposed mice.,"In this work, we compare two methods for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary airspace enlargement in a mouse model of chronic cigarette smoke exposure. Standard stereological sample preparation, sectioning, and imaging of mouse lung tissues were performed for semi-automated acquisition of mean linear intercept (L(m)) data. After completion of the L(m) measurements, D(2), a metric of airspace enlargement, was measured in a blinded manner on the same lung images using a fully automated technique developed in-house. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that although L(m) was able to separate the smoke-exposed and control groups with statistical significance (p = 0.034), D(2) was better able to differentiate the groups (p&lt;0.001) and did so without any overlap between the control and smoke-exposed individual animal data. In addition, the fully automated implementation of D(2) represented a time savings of at least 24x over semi-automated L(m) measurements. Although D(2) does not provide 3D stereological metrics of airspace dimensions as L(m) does, results show that it has higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting the subtle airspace enlargement one would expect to find in mild or early stage emphysema. Therefore, D(2) may serve as a more accurate screening measure for detecting early lung disease than L(m)."

It is also involved in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis and is found to be expressed in rapidly growing embryo and cancer cell lines. In order to explore the role of BYSL in cancer cell proliferation and growth, we used hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a model. Here, we report that BYSL is crucial for HCC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Expression levels of BYSL mRNA and protein in human HCC specimens were markedly increased compared with those seen in adjacent non-cancerous tissue. In vitro, inhibition of BYSL by short hairpin RNA decreased HCC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and partially arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. In vivo, HCC cells treated with BYSL siRNA failed to form tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous implantation. To determine the cellular basis for BYSL RNAi-induced cell growth arrest, BYSL subcellular localization in mitotic and interphase HepG2 cells was examined. BYSL was present at multiple stages during nucleologenesis, including in nucleolus-derived foci (NDF), perichromosomal regions and the prenucleolar body (PNB) during mitosis. BYSL depletion remarkably suppressed NDF and PNB formation, and disrupted nucleoli assembly after mitosis, resulting in increased apoptosis and reduced tolerance of HCC cells to serum starvation. Taken together, our studies indicate that upregulated BYSL expression plays a role in hepatocarcinogenesis."

Biol.,8109087,2009,Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1-deficient mice have reduced content and changed distribution of iduronic acids in dermatan sulfate and an altered collagen structure in skin.,"Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DS-epi1) and DS-epi2 convert glucuronic acid to iduronic acid in chondroitin/dermatan sulfate biosynthesis. Here we report on the generation of DS-epi1-null mice and the resulting alterations in the chondroitin/dermatan polysaccharide chains. The numbers of long blocks of adjacent iduronic acids are greatly decreased in skin decorin and biglycan chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, along with a parallel decrease in iduronic-2-O-sulfated-galactosamine-4-O-sulfated structures. Both iduronic acid blocks and iduronic acids surrounded by glucuronic acids are also decreased in versican-derived chains. DS-epi1-deficient mice are smaller than their wild-type littermates but otherwise have no gross macroscopic alterations. The lack of DS-epi1 affects the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in many proteoglycans, and the consequences for skin collagen structure were initially analyzed. We found that the skin collagen architecture was altered, and electron microscopy showed that the DS-epi1-null fibrils have a larger diameter than the wild-type fibrils. The altered chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains carried by decorin in skin are likely to affect collagen fibril formation and reduce the tensile strength of DS-epi1-null skin."

Biol.,8109087,2009,Evidence for an additional base-pairing element between the telomeric repeat and the telomerase RNA template in Kluyveromyces lactis and other yeasts.,"In all telomerases, the template region of the RNA subunit contains a region of telomere homology that is longer than the unit telomeric repeat. This allows a newly synthesized telomeric repeat to translocate back to the 3' end of the template prior to a second round of telomeric repeat synthesis. In the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, the telomerase RNA (Ter1) template has 30 nucleotides of perfect homology to the 25-bp telomeric repeat. Here we provide strong evidence that three additional nucleotides at positions -2 through -4 present on the 3' side of the template form base-pairing interactions with telomeric DNA. Mutation of these bases can lead to opposite effects on telomere length depending on the sequence permutation of the template in a manner consistent with whether the mutation increases or decreases the base-pairing potential with the telomere. Additionally, mutations in the -2 and -3 positions that restore base-pairing potential can suppress corresponding sequence changes in the telomeric repeat. Finally, multiple other yeast species were found to also have telomerase RNAs that encode relatively long 7- to 10-nucleotide domains predicted to base pair, often with imperfect pairing, with telomeric DNA. We further demonstrate that K. lactis telomeric fragments produce banded patterns with a 25-bp periodicity. This indicates that K. lactis telomeres have preferred termination points within the 25-bp telomeric repeat."
17855514,1,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2009,Myosin-driven peroxisome partitioning in S. cerevisiae.,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the class V myosin motor Myo2p propels the movement of most organelles. We recently identified Inp2p as the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p. In this study, we delineate the region of Myo2p devoted to binding peroxisomes. Using mutants of Myo2p specifically impaired in peroxisome binding, we dissect cell cycle-dependent and peroxisome partitioning-dependent mechanisms of Inp2p regulation. We find that although total Inp2p levels oscillate with the cell cycle, Inp2p levels on individual peroxisomes are controlled by peroxisome inheritance, as Inp2p aberrantly accumulates and decorates all peroxisomes in mother cells when peroxisome partitioning is abolished. We also find that Inp2p is a phosphoprotein whose level of phosphorylation is coupled to the cell cycle irrespective of peroxisome positioning in the cell. Our findings demonstrate that both organelle positioning and cell cycle progression control the levels of organelle-specific receptors for molecular motors to ultimately achieve an equidistribution of compartments between mother and daughter cells."

Cell,101120028,2009,Integrin-alpha9 is required for fibronectin matrix assembly during lymphatic valve morphogenesis.,"Dysfunction of lymphatic valves underlies human lymphedema, yet the process of valve morphogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that during embryogenesis, lymphatic valve leaflet formation is initiated by upregulation of integrin-alpha9 expression and deposition of its ligand fibronectin-EIIIA (FN-EIIIA) in the extracellular matrix. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of Itga9 (encoding integrin-alpha9) in mouse embryos results in the development of rudimentary valve leaflets characterized by disorganized FN matrix, short cusps, and retrograde lymphatic flow. Similar morphological and functional defects are observed in mice lacking the EIIIA domain of FN. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that in primary human lymphatic endothelial cells, the integrin-alpha9-EIIIA interaction directly regulates FN fibril assembly, which is essential for the formation of the extracellular matrix core of valve leaflets. Our findings reveal an important role for integrin-alpha9 signaling during lymphatic valve morphogenesis and implicate it as a candidate gene for primary lymphedema caused by valve defects."

17875722,1,BMC Mol. Biol.,100966983,2009,Functional mapping of the fission yeast DNA polymerase delta B-subunit Cdc1 by site-directed and random pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis.,"BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase delta plays an essential role in chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, being responsible for synthesising the bulk of the lagging strand. In fission yeast, Pol delta is a heterotetrameric enzyme comprising four evolutionarily well-conserved proteins: the catalytic subunit Pol3 and three smaller subunits Cdc1, Cdc27 and Cdm1. Pol3 binds directly to the B-subunit, Cdc1, which in turn binds the C-subunit, Cdc27. Human Pol delta comprises the same four subunits, and the crystal structure was recently reported of a complex of human p50 and the N-terminal domain of p66, the human orthologues of Cdc1 and Cdc27, respectively. RESULTS: To gain insights into the structure and function of Cdc1, random and directed mutagenesis techniques were used to create a collection of thirty alleles encoding mutant Cdc1 proteins. Each allele was tested for function in fission yeast and for binding of the altered protein to Pol3 and Cdc27 using the two-hybrid system. Additionally, the locations of the amino acid changes in each protein were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of human p50. The results obtained from these studies identify amino acid residues and regions within the Cdc1 protein that are essential for interaction with Pol3 and Cdc27 and for in vivo function. Mutations specifically defective in Pol3-Cdc1 interactions allow the identification of a possible Pol3 binding surface on Cdc1. CONCLUSION: In the absence of a three-dimensional structure of the entire Pol delta complex, the results of this study highlight regions in Cdc1 that are vital for protein function in vivo and provide valuable clues to possible protein-protein interaction surfaces on the Cdc1 protein that will be important targets for further study."

Cumulative evidences indicate that the deregulation of cyclin A(2) is tightly linked to the chromosomal instability, neoplastic transformation and tumor proliferation. Here we report that treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells with doxorubicin results in an accumulation of cyclin A(2) and follows by induction of apoptotic cell death. To investigate the potential preclinical relevance, K562 cells were transiently transfected with the siRNA targeting cyclin A(2) by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes. Knocking down the expression of cyclin A(2) in K562 cells suppressed doxorubicin-induced growth arrest and cell apoptosis. Upon administration with doxorubicin, K562 cells with reduced cyclin A(2) showed a significant decrease in erythroid differentiation, and a small fraction of cells were differentiated along megakaryocytic and monocyte-macrophage pathways. The results demonstrate the pro-apoptotic role of cyclin A(2) and suggest that cyclin A(2) is a key regulator of cell differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that knocking down expression of one gene switches differentiation pathways of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells."

17881560,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Identification of Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain CuZn superoxide dismutase as critical for resistance to extracellularly generated reactive oxygen species.,"Francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen whose survival is in part dependent on its ability to resist the microbicidal activity of host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In numerous bacterial pathogens, CuZn-containing superoxide dismutases (SodC) are important virulence factors, localizing to the periplasm to offer protection from host-derived superoxide radicals (O(2)(-)). In the present study, mutants of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) deficient in superoxide dismutases (SODs) were used to examine their role in defense against ROS/RNS-mediated microbicidal activity of infected macrophages. An in-frame deletion F. tularensis mutant of sodC (DeltasodC) and a F. tularensis DeltasodC mutant with attenuated Fe-superoxide dismutase (sodB) gene expression (sodB DeltasodC) were constructed and evaluated for susceptibility to ROS and RNS in gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-activated macrophages and a mouse model of respiratory tularemia. The F. tularensis DeltasodC and sodB DeltasodC mutants showed attenuated intramacrophage survival in IFN-gamma-activated macrophages compared to the wild-type F. tularensis LVS. Transcomplementing the sodC gene in the DeltasodC mutant or inhibiting the IFN-gamma-dependent production of O(2)(-) or nitric oxide (NO) enhanced intramacrophage survival of the sod mutants. The DeltasodC and sodB DeltasodC mutants were also significantly attenuated for virulence in intranasally challenged C57BL/6 mice compared to the wild-type F. tularensis LVS. As observed for macrophages, the virulence of the DeltasodC mutant was restored in ifn-gamma(-/-), inos(-/-), and phox(-/-) mice, indicating that SodC is required for resisting host-generated ROS. To conclude, this study demonstrates that SodB and SodC act to confer protection against host-derived oxidants and contribute to intramacrophage survival and virulence of F. tularensis in mice."

Sci.,7703701,2010,Evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer progression in glaucoma: a study on optical coherence tomography guided progression analysis.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurement for glaucoma progression analysis. METHODS: One hundred sixteen eyes of 64 patients with glaucoma who were observed within a period of 5 years were included. All eyes had at least four serial RNFL measurements obtained with the Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and with the first and last measurements separated by at least 3 years. Visual field (VF) testing was performed on the same day as RNFL imaging. Serial average RNFLTs were evaluated with guided progression analysis (GPA). VF progression was assessed with trend analysis of the visual field index (VFI). Factors associated with the rate of change in RNFLT were examined with a linear mixed model. RESULTS: A total of 1101 OCT scans and 1029 VFs were analyzed. Twenty-one and 22 eyes had progression according to RNFL and VF measurements, respectively, and 3 eyes had progression according to both measurements. The rate of change in VFI and RNFLT ranged between -0.5% and -7.2% per year (median loss, -3.0%/y) and between -1.2 and -15.4 microm per year (median loss, -3.3 microm/y), respectively. The sector at seven o'clock (right eye orientation) was the most frequent location that showed progression. A greater baseline RNFLT was associated with an increased rate of reduction of RNFLT (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: OCT GPA offers a new approach to augment glaucoma progression analysis. The rate of RNFLT thinning was variable among patients with glaucoma, with an increased rate of loss in patients with a higher baseline RNFLT."

In humans, a deficiency of alpha-NAGAL activity results in the lysosomal storage disorders Schindler disease and Kanzaki disease. To better understand the molecular defects in the diseases, we determined the crystal structure of human alpha-NAGAL after expressing wild-type and glycosylation-deficient glycoproteins in recombinant insect cell expression systems. We measured the enzymatic parameters of our purified wild-type and mutant enzymes, establishing their enzymatic equivalence. To investigate the binding specificity and catalytic mechanism of the human alpha-NAGAL enzyme, we determined three crystallographic complexes with different catalytic products bound in the active site of the enzyme. To better understand how individual defects in the alpha-NAGAL glycoprotein lead to Schindler disease, we analyzed the effect of disease-causing mutations on the three-dimensional structure."

It is thought to serve as a physical barrier from the extracellular environment and also as a receptor for various extracellular molecules. However, little is known about the fate of MUC1 during and after the interaction with these molecules. In the present study, we used anti-MUC1 antibody as an interacting molecule and investigated the cellular trafficking of MUC1. Our results showed that: (1) anti-MUC1 antibody was internalized only in MUC1 expressing cells and triggered internalization and down-regulation of MUC1; (2) the internalization of MUC1 by anti-MUC1 antibody required the cytoplasmic tail of MUC1 and was suppressed by inhibitors of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and caveola/raft-dependent internalization, but not by an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent internalization. We conclude that antibody-induced internalization of MUC1 involves the macropinocytotic pathway."

However, there are also innate sources of IL-17. Here, we show that gammadelta T cells express IL-23R and the transcription factor RORgammat and produce IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 in response to IL-1beta and IL-23, without T cell receptor engagement. IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells were found at high frequency in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 promoted IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and increased susceptibility to EAE, suggesting that gammadelta T cells act in an amplification loop for IL-17 production by Th17 cells. Our findings demonstrate that gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 are an important source of innate IL-17 and IL-21 and provide an alternative mechanism whereby IL-1 and IL-23 may mediate autoimmune inflammation."
17889653,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Splicing of intron 3 of human BACE requires the flanking introns 2 and 4.,"Regulation of proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the aspartic protease BACE may occur by alternative splicing and the generation of enzymatically inactive forms. In fact, the presence of exonic donor and acceptor sites for intron 3 generates the two deficient variants BACE457 and BACE476. In HEK293 cells, when introns are inserted separately in the BACE cDNA, we found that whilst introns 2 and 4 are efficiently spliced out, intron 3 is not removed. On the other hand, splicing to wild-type BACE is restored when intron 3 is flanked by the two other introns. The presence of all three introns also leads to alternative splicing of intron 3 and the generation of BACE476. In contrast, BACE457 expression takes place only after mutating the donor splice site of intron 3, indicating that additional regulatory elements are necessary for the use of the splicing site within exon 4. Overall, our data demonstrate that a complex splicing of intron 3 regulates the maturation of the BACE mRNA. This appears orchestrated by domains present in the exons and introns flanking intron 3. Excessive BACE activity is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, therefore this complex regulation might guarantee low neuronal BACE activity and disease prevention."

17893151,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Astrocytes are poised for lactate trafficking and release from activated brain and for supply of glucose to neurons.,"Brain is a highly-oxidative organ, but during activation, glycolytic flux is preferentially up-regulated even though oxygen supply is adequate. The biochemical and cellular basis of metabolic changes during brain activation and the fate of lactate produced within brain are important, unresolved issues central to understanding brain function, brain images, and spectroscopic data. Because in vivo brain imaging studies reveal rapid efflux of labeled glucose metabolites during activation, lactate trafficking among astrocytes and between astrocytes and neurons was examined after devising specific, real-time, sensitive enzymatic fluorescent assays to measure lactate and glucose levels in single cells in adult rat brain slices. Astrocytes have a 2- to 4-fold faster and higher capacity for lactate uptake from extracellular fluid and for lactate dispersal via the astrocytic syncytium compared to neuronal lactate uptake from extracellular fluid or shuttling of lactate to neurons from neighboring astrocytes. Astrocytes can also supply glucose to neurons as well as glucose can be taken up by neurons from extracellular fluid. Astrocytic networks can provide neuronal fuel and quickly remove lactate from activated glycolytic domains, and the lactate can be dispersed widely throughout the syncytium to endfeet along the vasculature for release to blood or other brain regions via perivascular fluid flow."
17898163,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis of hepatic adaptation to high-fat diets reveals switch from an inflammatory to steatotic transcriptional program.,"BACKGROUND: Excessive exposure to dietary fats is an important factor in the initiation of obesity and metabolic syndrome associated pathologies. The cellular processes associated with the onset and progression of diet-induced metabolic syndrome are insufficiently understood. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify the mechanisms underlying the pathological changes associated with short and long-term exposure to excess dietary fat, hepatic gene expression of ApoE3Leiden mice fed chow and two types of high-fat (HF) diets was monitored using microarrays during a 16-week period. A functional characterization of 1663 HF-responsive genes reveals perturbations in lipid, cholesterol and oxidative metabolism, immune and inflammatory responses and stress-related pathways. The major changes in gene expression take place during the early (day 3) and late (week 12) phases of HF feeding. This is also associated with characteristic opposite regulation of many HF-affected pathways between these two phases. The most prominent switch occurs in the expression of inflammatory/immune pathways (early activation, late repression) and lipogenic/adipogenic pathways (early repression, late activation). Transcriptional network analysis identifies NF-kappaB, NEMO, Akt, PPARgamma and SREBP1 as the key controllers of these processes and suggests that direct regulatory interactions between these factors may govern the transition from early (stressed, inflammatory) to late (pathological, steatotic) hepatic adaptation to HF feeding. This transition observed by hepatic gene expression analysis is confirmed by expression of inflammatory proteins in plasma and the late increase in hepatic triglyceride content. In addition, the genes most predictive of fat accumulation in liver during 16-week high-fat feeding period are uncovered by regression analysis of hepatic gene expression and triglyceride levels. CONCLUSIONS: The transition from an inflammatory to a steatotic transcriptional program, possibly driven by the reciprocal activation of NF-kappaB and PPARgamma regulators, emerges as the principal signature of the hepatic adaptation to excess dietary fat. These findings may be of essential interest for devising new strategies aiming to prevent the progression of high-fat diet induced pathologies."

Another explanation for tumour heterogeneity might be that the cells within a tumour are derived from tumour-initiating cells through diverse differentiation programmes. Tumour-initiating cells are thought to constitute one or more distinct subpopulations within a tumour and to drive tumour initiation, development and metastasis, as well as to be responsible for their recurrence after therapy. Recent studies have raised crucial questions about the nature, frequency and importance of melanoma-initiating cells. Here, we discuss our current understanding of melanoma-initiating cells and outline several approaches that the scientific community might consider to resolve the controversies surrounding these cells."

The protective role of PDGF on dopaminergic neurons, especially in the context of HIV-associated dementia (HAD), however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that exogenous PDGF was neuroprotective against toxicity induced by HIV-1 Tat in primary midbrain neurons. Furthermore, we report the involvement of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels in PDGF-mediated neuroprotection. TRPC channels are Ca(2+)-permeable, nonselective cation channels with a variety of physiological functions. Blocking TRPC channels with either a blocker or short-interfering RNAs (specific for TRPC 5 and 6) in primary neurons resulted in suppression of both PDGF-mediated neuroprotection as well as elevations in intracellular Ca(2+). PDGF-mediated neuroprotection involved parallel but distinct ERK/CREB and PI3K/Akt pathways. TRPC channel blocking also resulted in suppression of PDGF-induced Pyk2/ERK/CREB activation, but not Akt activation. Relevance of these findings in vivo was further corroborated by intrastriatal injections of PDGF and HIV-1 Tat in mice. Administration of PDGF was able to rescue the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra from Tat-induced neurotoxicity. This effect was attenuated by pre-treatment of mice with the TRP blocker, thus underscoring the novel role of TRPC channels in the neuroprotection mediated by PDGF."

However, techniques to generate cell type-specific lineage reporters, as well as reliable tools to disrupt, repair or overexpress genes by gene targeting, are inefficient at best and thus are not routinely used. Here we report the highly efficient targeting of three genes in human pluripotent cells using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated genome editing. First, using ZFNs specific for the OCT4 (POU5F1) locus, we generated OCT4-eGFP reporter cells to monitor the pluripotent state of hESCs. Second, we inserted a transgene into the AAVS1 locus to generate a robust drug-inducible overexpression system in hESCs. Finally, we targeted the PITX3 gene, demonstrating that ZFNs can be used to generate reporter cells by targeting non-expressed genes in hESCs and hiPSCs."
17909037,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,PKC phosphorylation of titin's PEVK element: a novel and conserved pathway for modulating myocardial stiffness.,"RATIONALE: Protein kinase C (PKC) regulates contractility of cardiac muscle cells by phosphorylating thin- and thick- filament-based proteins. Myocardial sarcomeres also contain a third myofilament, titin, and it is unknown whether titin can be phosphorylated by PKC and whether it affects passive tension. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PKC on titin phosphorylation and titin-based passive tension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phosphorylation assays with PKCalpha revealed that titin is phosphorylated in skinned myocardial tissues; this effect is exacerbated by pretreating with protein phosphatase 1. In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant protein representing titin's spring elements showed that PKCalpha targets the proline - glutamate - valine - lysine (PEVK) spring element. Furthermore, mass spectrometry in combination with site-directed mutagenesis identified 2 highly conserved sites in the PEVK region that are phosphorylated by PKCalpha (S11878 and S12022); when these 2 sites are mutated to alanine, phosphorylation is effectively abolished. Mechanical experiments with skinned left ventricular myocardium revealed that PKCalpha significantly increases titin-based passive tension, an effect that is reversed by protein phosphatase 1. Single molecule force-extension curves show that PKCalpha decreases the PEVK persistence length (from 1.20 nm to 0.55 nm), without altering the contour length, and using a serially-linked wormlike chain model we show that this increases titin-based passive force with a sarcomere length dependence that is similar to that measured in skinned myocardium after PKCalpha phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: PKC phosphorylation of titin is a novel and conserved pathway that links myocardial signaling and myocardial stiffness."

Here, we demonstrate that Cl(-) secretion in native epithelia activated by Ca(2+)-dependent agonists is missing in mice lacking expression of TMEM16A. Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) transport was missing or largely reduced in isolated tracheal and colonic epithelia, as well as hepatocytes and acinar cells from pancreatic and submandibular glands of TMEM16A(-/-) animals. Measurement of particle transport on the surface of tracheas ex vivo indicated largely reduced mucociliary clearance in TMEM16A(-/-) mice. These results clearly demonstrate the broad physiological role of TMEM16A(-/-) for Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion and provide the basis for novel treatments in cystic fibrosis, infectious diarrhea, and Sjöegren syndrome."
17909182,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,The DNA methylome of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, with high hyperdiploidy [51-67 chromosomes] and the t(12;21)(p13;q22) [ETV6/RUNX1 fusion] representing the most frequent abnormalities. Although these arise in utero, there is long latency before overt ALL, showing that additional changes are needed. Gene dysregulation through hypermethylation may be such an event; however, this has not previously been investigated in a detailed fashion. We performed genome-wide methylation profiling using bacterial artificial chromosome arrays and promoter-specific analyses of high hyperdiploid and ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs. In addition, global gene expression analyses were performed to identify associated expression patterns. Unsupervised cluster and principal component analyses of the chromosome-wide methylome profiles could successfully subgroup the two genetic ALL types. Analysis of all currently known promoter-specific CpG islands demonstrated that several B-cell- and neoplasia-associated genes were hypermethylated and underexpressed, indicating that aberrant methylation plays a significant leukemogenic role. Interestingly, methylation hotspots were associated with chromosome bands predicted to harbor imprinted genes and the tri-/tetrasomic chromosomes in the high hyperdiploid ALLs were less methylated than their disomic counterparts. Decreased methylation of gained chromosomes is a previously unknown phenomenon that may have ramifications not only for the pathogenesis of high hyperdiploid ALL but also for other disorders with acquired or constitutional numerical chromosome anomalies."

17911250,1,Genes Immun.,100953417,2010,Multiple loci comprising immune-related genes regulate experimental neuroinflammation.,"A 58 Mb region on rat chromosome 4 known to regulate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was genetically dissected. High-resolution linkage analysis in an advanced intercross line (AIL) revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs), Eae24-Eae27. Both Eae24 and Eae25 regulated susceptibility and severity phenotypes, whereas Eae26 regulated severity and Eae27 regulated susceptibility. Analyses of the humoral immune response revealed that the levels of serum anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunoglobin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are linked to Eae24 and anti-MOG IgG2b antibodies are linked to both Eae24 and Eae26. We tested the parental DA strain and six recombinant congenic strains that include overlapping fragments of this region in MOG-EAE. Eae24 and Eae25 showed significant protection during the acute phase of EAE, whereas Eae25 and Eae26 significantly modified severity but not susceptibility. The smallest congenic fragment, which carries Eae25 alone, influenced both susceptibility and severity, and protected from the chronic phase of disease. These results support the multiple QTLs identified in the AIL. By demonstrating several QTLs comprising immune-related genes, which potentially interact, we provide a significant step toward elucidation of the polygenically regulated pathogenesis of MOG-EAE and possibly multiple sclerosis (MS), and opportunities for comparative genetics and testing in MS case-control cohorts."
17911258,1,J. Invest. Dermatol.,426720,2010,Skin-resident T cells: the ups and downs of on site immunity.,"The cutaneous surface of a normal adult individual contains approximately 20 billion T cells, nearly twice the number present in the entire circulation. Recent studies have shown a role for these cells in both normal immunity and in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Regulatory T cells protect against autoimmune reactions to self antigens and assist in the resolution of cutaneous inflammation. However, they can also shield tumors from immune detection, allow latent infections to persist and can dysfunction under the conditions present in inflammatory skin diseases. Th17 T cells protect organisms against extracellular pathogens but also have a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Evidence suggests that effector memory T cells produced during immune reactions survive and persist long term within the skin, providing local and rapid protection against pathogen reexposure. This review summarizes the current understanding of how skin-resident T cells contribute to normal and aberrant immunity in the skin."
17913813,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Attention improves object representation in visual cortical field potentials.,"Selective attention improves perception and modulates neuronal responses, but how attention-dependent changes of cortical activity improve the processing of attended objects is an open question. Changes in total signal strength or enhancements in signal-to-noise ratio have been proposed as putative mechanisms. However, it is still not clear whether, and to what extent, these processes contribute to the large perceptual improvements. We studied the ability to discriminate states of activity in visual cortex evoked by differently shaped objects depending on selective attention in monkeys. We found that gamma-band activity from V4 and V1 contains a high amount of information about stimulus shape, which increases for V4 recordings considerably with attention in successful trials, but not in case of behavioral errors. This effect resulted from enhanced differences between the stimulus-specific distributions of power spectral amplitudes. It could be explained neither by enhancements of signal-to-noise ratios, nor by changes in total signal power. Instead our results indicate that attention causes underlying cortical network states to become more distinct for different stimuli, providing a new neurophysiological explanation for improvements of behavioral performance by attention. The absence of the enhancement in discriminability in trials with behavioral errors demonstrates the relevance of this novel neural mechanism for perception."
17914457,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Homologous recombination but not nucleotide excision repair plays a pivotal role in tolerance of DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells.,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are unique among DNA lesions in their unusually bulky nature. The steric hindrance imposed by cross-linked proteins (CLPs) will hamper DNA transactions, such as replication and transcription, posing an enormous threat to cells. In bacteria, DPCs with small CLPs are eliminated by nucleotide excision repair (NER), whereas oversized DPCs are processed exclusively by RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination (HR). Here we have assessed the roles of NER and HR for DPCs in mammalian cells. We show that the upper size limit of CLPs amenable to mammalian NER is relatively small (8-10 kDa) so that NER cannot participate in the repair of chromosomal DPCs in mammalian cells. Moreover, CLPs are not polyubiquitinated and hence are not subjected to proteasomal degradation prior to NER. In contrast, HR constitutes the major pathway in tolerance of DPCs as judged from cell survival and RAD51 and gamma-H2AX nuclear foci formation. Induction of DPCs results in the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in HR-deficient but not HR-proficient cells, suggesting that fork breakage at the DPC site initiates HR and reactivates the stalled fork. DPCs activate both ATR and ATM damage response pathways, but there is a time lag between two responses. These results highlight the differential involvement of NER in the repair of DPCs in bacterial and mammalian cells and demonstrate the versatile and conserved role of HR in tolerance of DPCs among species."
17914462,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor is associated with MIG6 expression.,"Controlled activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is systematically guaranteed at the molecular level; however, aberrant activation of EGFR is frequently found in cancer. Transcription induced by EGFR activation often involves the coordinated expression of genes that positively and negatively regulate the original signaling pathway; therefore, alterations in EGFR kinase activity may reflect changes in gene expression associated with the pathway. In the present study, we investigated transcriptional changes after EGF stimulation with or without the EGFR kinase inhibitor Iressa in H1299 human non-small-cell lung cancer cells [parental H1299, H1299 cells that overexpress wild-type EGFR (EGFR-WT) and mutant H1299 cells that overexpress EGFR where Leu858 is substituted with Arg (L858R)]. The results obtained clearly demonstrate differences in transcriptional activity in the absence or presence of EGFR kinase activity, with genes sharing the same molecular functions showing distinct expression dynamics. The results show the particular enrichment of EGFR/ErbB signaling-related genes in a differentially expressed gene set, and significant protein expression of MIG6/RALT(ERRFI1), an EGFR negative regulator, was confirmed in L858R. High MIG6 protein expression was correlated with basal EGFR phosphorylation and inversely correlated with EGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation levels. Investigation of the NCI-60 cell lines showed that ERRFI1 expression was correlated with EGFR expression, regardless of tissue type. These results suggest that cells accumulate MIG6 as an inherent negative regulator to suppress excess EGFR activity when basal EGFR kinase activity is considerably high. Taking all the above together, an EGFR mutation can cause transcriptional changes to accommodate the activation potency of the original signaling pathway at the cellular level."

17914904,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Lymphovascular invasion in rectal cancer following neoadjuvant radiotherapy: a retrospective cohort study.,"AIM: To investigate the meaning of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 325 patients who underwent radical resection using total mesorectal excision (TME) from January 2000 to January 2005 in Beijing cancer hospital were included retrospectively, divided into a preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) group and a control group, according to whether or not they underwent preoperative radiation. Histological assessments of tumor specimens were made and the correlation of LVI and prognosis were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The occurrence of LVI in the PRT and control groups was 21.4% and 26.1% respectively. In the control group, LVI was significantly associated with histological differentiation and pathologic TNM stage, whereas these associations were not observed in the PRT group. LVI was closely correlated to disease progression and 5-year overall survival (OS) in both groups. Among the patients with disease progression, LVI positive patients in the PRT group had a significantly longer median disease-free period (22.5 mo vs 11.5 mo, P = 0.023) and overall survival time (42.5 mo vs 26.5 mo, P = 0.035) compared to those in the control group, despite the fact that no significant difference in 5-year OS rate was observed (54.4% vs 48.3%, P = 0.137). Multivariate analysis showed the distance of tumor from the anal verge, pretreatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, pathologic TNM stage and LVI were the major factors affecting OS. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy does not reduce LVI significantly; however, the prognostic meaning of LVI has changed. Patients with LVI may benefit from neoadjuvant radiotherapy."
17921255,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Endoscopic management of biliary strictures after liver transplantation.,"Bile duct strictures remain a major source of morbidity after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Biliary strictures are classified as anastomotic or non-anastomotic strictures according to location and are defined by distinct clinical behaviors. Anastomotic strictures are localized and short. The outcome of endoscopic treatment for anastomotic strictures is excellent. Non-anastomotic strictures often result from ischemic and immunological events, occur earlier and are usually multiple and longer. They are characterized by a far less favorable response to endoscopic management, higher recurrence rates, graft loss and need for retransplantation. Living donor OLT patients present a unique set of challenges arising from technical factors, and stricture risk for both recipients and donors. Endoscopic treatment of living donor OLT patients is less promising. Current endoscopic strategies for biliary strictures after OLT include repeated balloon dilations and placement of multiple side-by-side plastic stents. Lifelong surveillance is required in all types of strictures. Despite improvements in incidence and long term outcomes with endoscopic management, and a reduced need for surgical treatment, the impact of strictures on patients after OLT is significant. Future considerations include new endoscopic technologies and improved stents, which could potentially allow for a decreased number of interventions, increased intervals before retreatment, and decreased reliance on percutaneous and surgical modalities. This review focuses on the role of endoscopy in biliary strictures, one of the most common biliary complications after OLT."
17921256,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Histone modifications within the human X centromere region.,"Human centromeres are multi-megabase regions of highly ordered arrays of alpha satellite DNA that are separated from chromosome arms by unordered alpha satellite monomers and other repetitive elements. Complexities in assembling such large repetitive regions have limited detailed studies of centromeric chromatin organization. However, a genomic map of the human X centromere has provided new opportunities to explore genomic architecture of a complex locus. We used ChIP to examine the distribution of modified histones within centromere regions of multiple X chromosomes. Methylation of H3 at lysine 4 coincided with DXZ1 higher order alpha satellite, the site of CENP-A localization. Heterochromatic histone modifications were distributed across the 400-500 kb pericentromeric regions. The large arrays of alpha satellite and gamma satellite DNA were enriched for both euchromatic and heterochromatic modifications, implying that some pericentromeric repeats have multiple chromatin characteristics. Partial truncation of the X centromere resulted in reduction in the size of the CENP-A/Cenp-A domain and increased heterochromatic modifications in the flanking pericentromere. Although the deletion removed approximately 1/3 of centromeric DNA, the ratio of CENP-A to alpha satellite array size was maintained in the same proportion, suggesting that a limited, but defined linear region of the centromeric DNA is necessary for kinetochore assembly. Our results indicate that the human X centromere contains multiple types of chromatin, is organized similarly to smaller eukaryotic centromeres, and responds to structural changes by expanding or contracting domains."
17923091,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Vav links the T cell antigen receptor to the actin cytoskeleton and T cell activation independently of intrinsic Guanine nucleotide exchange activity.,"BACKGROUND: T cell receptor (TCR) engagement leads to formation of signaling microclusters and induction of rapid and dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton, although the exact mechanism by which the TCR initiates actin polymerization is incompletely understood. The Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) has been implicated in generation of TCR signals and immune synapse formation, however, it is currently not known if Vav's GEF activity is required in T cell activation by the TCR in general, and in actin polymerization downstream of the TCR in particular. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that Vav1 assembles into signaling microclusters at TCR contact sites and is critical for TCR-initiated actin polymerization. Surprisingly, Vav1 functions in TCR signaling and Ca(++) mobilization via a mechanism that does not appear to strictly depend on the intrinsic GEF activity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose here a model in which Vav functions primarily as a tyrosine phosphorylated linker-protein for TCR activation of T cells. Our results indicate that, contrary to expectations based on previously published studies including from our own laboratory, pharmacological inhibition of Vav1's intrinsic GEF activity may not be an effective strategy for T cell-directed immunosuppressive therapy."
17923670,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Cardiac hypertrophy involves both myocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia in anemic zebrafish.,"BACKGROUND: An adult zebrafish heart possesses a high capacity of regeneration. However, it has been unclear whether and how myocyte hyperplasia contributes to cardiac remodeling in response to biomechanical stress and whether myocyte hypertrophy exists in the zebrafish. To address these questions, we characterized the zebrafish mutant tr265/tr265, whose Band 3 mutation disrupts erythrocyte formation and results in anemia. Although Band 3 does not express and function in the heart, the chronic anemia imposes a sequential biomechanical stress towards the heart. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hearts of the tr265/tr265 Danio rerio mutant become larger than those of the sibling by week 4 post fertilization and gradually exhibit characteristics of human cardiomyopathy, such as muscular disarray, re-activated fetal gene expression, and severe arrhythmia. At the cellular level, we found both increased individual cardiomyocyte size and increased myocyte proliferation can be detected in week 4 to week 12 tr265/tr265 fish. Interestingly, all tr265/tr265 fish that survive after week-12 have many more cardiomyocytes of smaller size than those in the sibling, suggesting that myocyte hyperplasia allows the long-term survival of these fish. We also show the cardiac hypertrophy process can be recapitulated in wild-type fish using the anemia-inducing drug phenylhydrazine (PHZ). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The anemia-induced cardiac hypertrophy models reported here are the first adult zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy models characterized. Unlike mammalian models, both cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia contribute to the cardiac remodeling process in these models, thus allowing the effects of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia on cardiac remodeling to be studied. However, since anemia can induce effects on the heart other than biomechanical, non-anemic zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy models shall be generated and characterized."
17928403,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Tumour growth and resistance to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells are decreased by AP-2alpha overexpression.,"BACKGROUND: Activator protein-2alpha (AP-2alpha) is a transcription factor that belongs to the family of AP-2 proteins that have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Indeed, AP-2alpha is considered as a tumour-suppressor gene in different tissues such as colonic, prostatic or breast epithelial cells. Moreover, AP-2alpha also participates in the control of colon and breast cancer cells sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic drugs. Despite its potential interest, very few data are available regarding the roles of AP-2alpha in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We have developed a stable pancreatic CAPAN-1 cell line overexpressing AP-2alpha. Consequences of overexpression were studied in terms of in vivo cell growth, gene expression, migration capacity and chemosensitivity. RESULTS: In vivo tumour growth of CAPAN-1 cells overexpressing AP-2alpha was significantly decreased by comparison to control cells. An altered expression pattern of cell cycle-controlling factors (CDK-4, CDK-6, cyclin-G1, p27(kip1) and p57(kip2)) was observed in AP-2alpha-overexpressing clones by microarrays and western blot analysis. Promoter activity and ChIP analysis indicated that AP-2alpha induces p27(kip1) protein levels by direct binding to and transactivation of its promoter. Moreover, AP-2alpha overexpression increased the chemosensitivity of CAPAN-1 cells to low doses of gemcitabine and reduced their in vitro migration capacity. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that AP-2alpha overexpression could be exploited to decrease in vivo tumour growth of pancreatic cancer cells and to increase their sensitivity to gemcitabine."
17928627,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,"Radioresistant cervical cancer shows upregulation of the NHEJ proteins DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku86.","BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is central in the treatment of cervical cancer. The formation of DNA double-strand breaks is considered to be critical for the radiotherapeutic effect. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) proteins DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku86 have a major role in repairing DNA lesions. The objective of this study was to analyse if the expression of DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku86 and their downstream signalling molecules p53, p21 and Mdm-2 are altered in residual cervical tumours after radiotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 127 patients with cervical cancer stage IB-IIA treated with preoperative radiotherapy and radical surgery, revealed residual tumour in the cervical specimen in 30 patients. In 22 cases tumour material from residual and corresponding primary tumour were retrieved and the expression of DNA-PKcs, Ku86, Ku70, p53, p21 and Mdm-2 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Residual tumours showed increased frequency of DNA-PKcs (P=0.037), Ku70 (P=0.018), Ku86 (P=0.008) positive cells. A correlation in DNA-PKcs expression between primary and residual tumours was found. The frequency of p21-positive cells was decreased (P=0.007) in residual tumours whereas no change in p53 or Mdm-2-positive cells were observed. CONCLUSION: Our results show that cervical carcinoma surviving radiotherapy have an increased DNA-PK expression. Studies on larger patient cohorts are needed to allow an interpretation that an upregulation of DNA-PK function may be part of a radioresistance mechanism within this tumour type."
17932483,1,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,cDNA sequencing improves the detection of P53 missense mutations in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Recently published data showed discrepancies between P53 cDNA and DNA sequencing in glioblastomas. We hypothesised that similar discrepancies may be observed in other human cancers. METHODS: To this end, we analyzed 23 colorectal cancers for P53 mutations and gene expression using both DNA and cDNA sequencing, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found P53 gene mutations in 16 cases (15 missense and 1 nonsense). Two of the 15 cases with missense mutations showed alterations based only on cDNA, and not DNA sequencing. Moreover, in 6 of the 15 cases with a cDNA mutation those mutations were difficult to detect in the DNA sequencing, so the results of DNA analysis alone could be misinterpreted if the cDNA sequencing results had not also been available. In all those 15 cases, we observed a higher ratio of the mutated to the wild type template by cDNA analysis, but not by the DNA analysis. Interestingly, a similar overexpression of P53 mRNA was present in samples with and without P53 mutations. CONCLUSION: In terms of colorectal cancer, those discrepancies might be explained under three conditions: 1, overexpression of mutated P53 mRNA in cancer cells as compared with normal cells; 2, a higher content of cells without P53 mutation (normal cells and cells showing K-RAS and/or APC but not P53 mutation) in samples presenting P53 mutation; 3, heterozygous or hemizygous mutations of P53 gene. Additionally, for heterozygous mutations unknown mechanism(s) causing selective overproduction of mutated allele should also be considered. Our data offer new clues for studying discrepancy in P53 cDNA and DNA sequencing analysis."
17932487,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Ligand scaffold hopping combining 3D maximal substructure search and molecular similarity.,"BACKGROUND: Virtual screening methods are now well established as effective to identify hit and lead candidates and are fully integrated in most drug discovery programs. Ligand-based approaches make use of physico-chemical, structural and energetics properties of known active compounds to search large chemical libraries for related and novel chemotypes. While 2D-similarity search tools are known to be fast and efficient, the use of 3D-similarity search methods can be very valuable to many research projects as integration of &quot;3D knowledge&quot; can facilitate the identification of not only related molecules but also of chemicals possessing distant scaffolds as compared to the query and therefore be more inclined to scaffolds hopping. To date, very few methods performing this task are easily available to the scientific community. RESULTS: We introduce a new approach (LigCSRre) to the 3D ligand similarity search of drug candidates. It combines a 3D maximum common substructure search algorithm independent on atom order with a tunable description of atomic compatibilities to prune the search and increase its physico-chemical relevance. We show, on 47 experimentally validated active compounds across five protein targets having different specificities, that for single compound search, the approach is able to recover on average 52% of the co-actives in the top 1% of the ranked list which is better than gold standards of the field. Moreover, the combination of several runs on a single protein target using different query active compounds shows a remarkable improvement in enrichment. Such Results demonstrate LigCSRre as a valuable tool for ligand-based screening. CONCLUSION: LigCSRre constitutes a new efficient and generic approach to the 3D similarity screening of small compounds, whose flexible design opens the door to many enhancements. The program is freely available to the academics for non-profit research at: http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/LigCSRre.html."
17932490,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1 facilitates re-epithelialization by affecting alpha(2)beta(1) integrin activation.,"BACKGROUND: Lung injury promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7, matrilysin), which is required for neutrophil recruitment and re-epithelialization. MMP7 governs the lung inflammatory response through the shedding of syndecan-1. Because inflammation and repair are related events, we evaluated the role of syndecan-1 shedding in lung re-epithelialization. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Epithelial injury induced syndecan-1 shedding from wild-type epithelium but not from Mmp7(-/-) mice in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cell migration and wound closure was enhanced by MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1. Additionally, we found that syndecan-1 augmented cell adhesion to collagen by controlling the affinity state of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1 facilitates wound closure by causing the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin to assume a less active conformation thereby removing restrictions to migration. MMP7 acts in the lungs to regulate inflammation and repair, and our data now show that both these functions are controlled through the shedding of syndecan-1."
17932491,1,Cell Res.,9425763,2009,Downregulation of cyclooxygenase-1 is involved in gastric mucosal apoptosis via death signaling in portal hypertensive rats.,"Portal hypertension (PHT) gastropathy is a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis and one of the leading causes of death from cirrhosis. Apoptosis is widely considered to be an active energy-dependent mode of cell death and a distinct entity from necrotic cell death. It is unclear whether gastric mucosal apoptosis is involved in PHT gastropathy. Prostaglandins (PGs) produced through cyclooxygenase (COX) are thought to play a key role in protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa from injury and apoptosis. However, the role of COX in PHT gastropathy is still not clearly understood. The aims of this study were to investigate whether (1) gastric mucosal apoptosis is involved in PHT gastropathy and (2) downregulation of COX contributes to this apoptosis. In this study, we show that gastric mucosal apoptosis was remarkably increased while mucosal proliferation was inhibited in PHT rats. Gastric mucosal COX-1 was significantly suppressed at both the mRNA and protein levels, and PGE(2) was reduced in PHT rats. Further, PGE(2) treatment suppressed gastric mucosal apoptosis in PHT rats. However, gastric mucosal COX-2 levels did not differ between sham-operated rats and PHT rats. Gastric mucosal levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Fas ligand, but not TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, were increased, and activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 levels were upregulated in PHT rats. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was not observed in PHT rats. Our data indicate that downregulation of COX-1 is involved in gastric mucosal apoptosis via death signaling-mediated type-I cell death in PHT rats."
17932512,1,Oncogene,8711562,2009,Acetylation of RTN-1C regulates the induction of ER stress by the inhibition of HDAC activity in neuroectodermal tumors.,"Reticulons are a family of highly conserved proteins, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in different cellular functions, such as intracellular membrane trafficking, apoptosis and nuclear envelope formation. The reticulon protein family consists of four members, but their specific functions are presently poorly understood. RTN-1C overexpression triggers apoptosis, regulating ER stress versus DNA damage-induced cell death in a mutually exclusive way. The different RTN isoforms share a C-terminal reticulon homology domain containing two hydrophobic segments and a 66-amino acid hydrophilic loop. In the C-terminal region of RTN-1C, a unique consensus sequence (GAKRH) has recently been identified, showing 100% identity with the DNA-binding domain of histone H4. In this study, we show that this sequence is essential for RTN-1C-mediated apoptosis. It is noteworthy that the lysine 204 present in this region is post-translationally modified by acetylation and that this event is associated with a significant decrease in histone deacetylase activity and contributes to RTN-1C binding to DNA. These data demonstrate a molecular mechanism by which RTN-1C controls apoptosis and indicate this protein to be a novel potential target for cancer therapy."

Methods,101215604,2009,Digital transcriptome profiling using selective hexamer priming for cDNA synthesis.,"We developed a procedure for the preparation of whole transcriptome cDNA libraries depleted of ribosomal RNA from only 1 microg of total RNA. The method relies on a collection of short, computationally selected oligonucleotides, called 'not-so-random' (NSR) primers, to obtain full-length, strand-specific representation of nonribosomal RNA transcripts. In this study we validated the technique by profiling human whole brain and universal human reference RNA using ultra-high-throughput sequencing."
17934474,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Structural basis of yeast Tim40/Mia40 as an oxidative translocator in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.,"The mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) contains many small cysteine-bearing proteins, and their passage across the outer membrane and subsequent folding require recognition and disulfide bond transfer by an oxidative translocator Tim40/Mia40 in the inner membrane facing the IMS. Here we determined the crystal structure of the core domain of yeast Mia40 (Mia40C4) as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein at a resolution of 3 A. The overall structure of Mia40C4 is a fruit-dish-like shape with a hydrophobic concave region, which accommodates a linker segment of the fusion protein in a helical conformation, likely mimicking a bound substrate. Replacement of the hydrophobic residues in this region resulted in growth defects and impaired assembly of a substrate protein. The Cys296-Cys298 disulfide bond is close to the hydrophobic concave region or possible substrate-binding site, so that it can mediate disulfide bond transfer to substrate proteins. These results are consistent with the growth phenotypes of Mia40 mutant cells containing Ser replacement of the conserved cysteine residues."
17937504,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Genetic evidence for the role of Erk activation in a lymphoproliferative disease of mice.,"Germline mutation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) gene at the phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1)-binding site leads to a fatal lymphoproliferative disease in mice. The hyperactivated T cells that develop in these mice have defective T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced calcium flux but enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. We used genetic analysis to investigate genes whose products might suppress MAPK activation and lymphoproliferative disease in LAT mutant mice. B-lymphocyte adaptor molecule of 32 kDa (Bam32) is a known mediator of MAPK activation in B cells. We recently reported that in CD4(+) T cells, Bam32 deficiency decreased MAPK activation and specifically extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling, following TCR stimulation. By crossing the Bam32 null mutation onto the LAT knock-in background, we found that the Bam32 null mutation delayed the onset and decreased the severity of lymphoproliferative disease in LAT knock-in mice. The pulmonary lymphocyte infiltration seen in LAT knock-in mice was also markedly decreased in double-mutant mice. Additionally, Erk activation was diminished in LAT knock-in Bam32 knockout CD4(+) T cells. To more accurately determine the role of Erk in this delay of lymphoproliferative disease, we also bred a transgenic, hypersensitive Erk allele (the Erk2 sevenmaker mutant) onto the LAT knock-in Bam32 knockout double-mutant background. These triple transgenic mice demonstrated a role for Erk activation in lymphoproliferative disease caused by the LAT knock-in mutation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Engineering of bio-hybrid materials by electrospinning polymer-microbe fibers.,"Although microbes have been used in industrial and niche applications for several decades, successful immobilization of microbes while maintaining their usefulness for any desired application has been elusive. Such a functionally bioactive system has distinct advantages over conventional batch and continuous-flow microbial reactor systems that are used in various biotechnological processes. This article describes the use of polyethylene oxide(99)-polypropylene oxide(67)-polyethylene oxide(99) triblock polymer fibers, created via electrospinning, to encapsulate microbes of 3 industrially relevant genera, namely, Pseudomonas, Zymomonas, and Escherichia. The presence of bacteria inside the fibers was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and SEM. Although the electrospinning process typically uses harsh organic solvents and extreme conditions that generally are harmful to bacteria, we describe techniques that overcome these limitations. The encapsulated microbes were viable for several months, and their metabolic activity was not affected by immobilization; thus they could be used in various applications. Furthermore, we have engineered a microbe-encapsulated cross-linked fibrous polymeric material that is insoluble. Also, the microbe-encapsulated active matrix permits efficient exchange of nutrients and metabolic products between the microorganism and the environment. The present results demonstrate the potential of the electrospinning technique for the encapsulation and immobilization of bacteria in the form of a synthetic biofilm, while retaining their metabolic activity. This study has wide-ranging implications in the engineering and use of novel bio-hybrid materials or biological thin-film catalysts."

Cell Biol.,375356,2009,Multiparametric analysis of focal adhesion formation by RNAi-mediated gene knockdown.,"Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated by elaborate networks of multiprotein complexes consisting of adhesion receptors, cytoskeletal components, signaling molecules, and diverse adaptor proteins. To explore how specific molecular pathways function in the assembly of focal adhesions (FAs), we performed a high-throughput, high-resolution, microscopy-based screen. We used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to target human kinases, phosphatases, and migration- and adhesion-related genes. Multiparametric image analysis of control and of siRNA-treated cells revealed major correlations between distinct morphological FA features. Clustering analysis identified different gene families whose perturbation induced similar effects, some of which uncoupled the interfeature correlations. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the molecular hierarchy of FA formation, and tested its validity by dynamic analysis of FA formation and turnover. This study provides a comprehensive information resource on the molecular regulation of multiple cell adhesion features, and sheds light on signaling mechanisms regulating the formation of integrin adhesions."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,A TLR2 agonist in German cockroach frass activates MMP-9 release and is protective against allergic inflammation in mice.,"The role of TLR2 in modulating experimentally induced asthma is not fully understood. We recently identified that German cockroach (GC) frass contains a TLR2 ligand allowing us to investigate the role of a TLR2 agonist in a complex real world allergen in mediating allergic airway inflammation. GC frass exposure significantly increased airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and serum IgE levels in wild-type mice; however the same exposure in TLR2-deficient mice resulted in greatly exaggerated serum IgE and eosinophilia but diminished airway neutrophilia, suggesting a protective role for TLR2. Since GC frass inhalation usually induces airway neutrophilia, we queried the effect of neutrophil depletion on airway responses. Inhibition of neutrophil recruitment into the airways of naive wild-type mice before intratracheal inhalation of GC frass resulted in significantly increased levels of serum IgE and eosinophilia. Neutrophils are a rich source of MMP-9, and we found that MMP-9 levels were significantly increased in the airways of mice following exposure to GC frass. Importantly the levels of MMP-9 were significantly decreased in neutrophil-depleted and TLR2-deficient mice after exposure to GC frass, suggesting that TLR2 regulated MMP-9 release from neutrophils. Functionally, MMP-9-deficient mice had more acute allergic inflammation than wild-type mice, suggesting that MMP-9 was protective against experimentally induced asthma. These data suggest that TLR2 activation of neutrophils leads to release of MMP-9 which decreases allergic responses to GC frass. This suggests a protective role for TLR2 activation and MMP-9 release in the context of experimentally induced asthma in mice."
17940036,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Jagged1 on dendritic cells and Notch on CD4+ T cells initiate lung allergic responsiveness by inducing IL-4 production.,"Jagged1, a Notch ligand, and Notch have been implicated in Th2 differentiation, but their role in initiating IL-4 production and Th2 differentiation in vivo and the development of allergic airway responses has not been defined. In this study, we show that Jagged1 is up-regulated on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with allergen and that the transfer of these BMDCs before allergen challenge induces airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and eosinophilic airway inflammation. Treatment of CD4(+) T cells with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), which inhibits Notch signaling, resulted in decreased cytokine production when the cells were cocultured with allergen-pulsed, Jagged1-expressing BMDCs and, after the transfer of allergen-pulsed BMDCs, IL-4-deficient (IL-4(-/-)) recipients of GSI-treated naive CD4(+) T cells developed lower levels of AHR, reduced numbers of eosinophils, and lower Th2 cytokine levels when challenged with allergen. In vivo treatment of wild-type mice with Jagged1-Fc enhanced AHR and airway inflammation, whereas the transfer of BMDC transfected with Jagged1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) cells into WT or IL-4(-/-) mice before transfer of CD4(+) T cells resulted in decreased AHR, inflammation, and Th2 cytokines, indicating the critical role for Jagged1 expression on APCs. These data identify the essential role of the interactions between Notch on CD4(+) T cells and Jagged1 on APCs in the initiation of IL-4 production and Th2 differentiation for the development of AHR and allergic airway inflammation."
17940044,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,The adapter protein SLP-76 mediates &quot;outside-in&quot; integrin signaling and function in T cells.,"The adapter protein SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) is an essential mediator of signaling from the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). We report here that SLP-76 also mediates signaling downstream of integrins in T cells and that SLP-76-deficient T cells fail to support adhesion to integrin ligands. In response to both TCR and integrin stimulation, SLP-76 relocalizes to surface microclusters that colocalize with phosphorylated signaling proteins. Disruption of SLP-76 recruitment to the protein named LAT (linker for activation of T cells) inhibits SLP-76 clustering downstream of the TCR but not downstream of integrins. Conversely, an SLP-76 mutant unable to bind ADAP (adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein) forms clusters following TCR but not integrin engagement and fails to support T-cell adhesion to integrin ligands. These findings demonstrate that SLP-76 relocalizes to integrin-initiated signaling complexes by a mechanism different from that employed during TCR signaling and that SLP-76 relocalization corresponds to SLP-76-dependent integrin function in T cells."
17940050,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,Decreased TNF-alpha synthesis by macrophages restricts cutaneous immunosurveillance by memory CD4+ T cells during aging.,"Immunity declines during aging, however the mechanisms involved in this decline are not known. In this study, we show that cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to recall antigens are significantly decreased in older individuals. However, this is not related to CC chemokine receptor 4, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, or CD11a expression by CD4(+) T cells or their physical capacity for migration. Instead, there is defective activation of dermal blood vessels in older subject that results from decreased TNF-alpha secretion by macrophages. This prevents memory T cell entry into the skin after antigen challenge. However, isolated cutaneous macrophages from these subjects can be induced to secrete TNF-alpha after stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 or TLR 4 ligands in vitro, indicating that the defect is reversible. The decreased conditioning of tissue microenvironments by macrophage-derived cytokines may therefore lead to defective immunosurveillance by memory T cells. This may be a predisposing factor for the development of malignancy and infection in the skin during aging."
17940053,1,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,Complicated urinary tract infection is associated with uroepithelial expression of proinflammatory protein S100A8.,"F344 rats chronically infected with Ureaplasma parvum develop two distinct profiles: asymptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) and UTI complicated by struvite urolithiasis. To identify factors that affect disease outcome, we characterized the temporal host immune response during infection by histopathologic analysis and in situ localization of U. parvum. We also used differential quantitative proteomics to identify distinguishing host cellular responses associated with complicated UTI. In animals in which microbial colonization was limited to the mucosal surface, inflammation was indistinguishable from that which occurred in sham-inoculated controls, and the inflammation resolved by 72 h postinoculation (p.i.) in both groups. However, inflammation persisted in animals with microbial colonization that extended into the deeper layers of the submucosa. Proteome profiling showed that bladder tissues from animals with complicated UTIs had significant increases (P &lt; 0.01) in proteins involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Animals with complicated UTIs (2 weeks p.i.) had the highest concentrations of the proinflammatory protein S100A8 (P &lt;or= 0.005) in bladder tissues, and the levels of S100A8 positively correlated with those of proinflammatory cytokines GRO/KC (P &lt;or= 0.003) and interleukin-1 alpha (P &lt;or= 0.03) in urine. The bladder uroepithelium was a prominent cell source of S100A8-S100A9 in animals with complicated UTIs (2 weeks p.i.), which was not detected in animals with asymptomatic UTIs (2 weeks p.i.) or in any bladder tissues harvested at earlier p.i. time points. Based on these results, we surmise that invasive colonization of the bladder triggers chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, which may be critical to struvite formation."

Genet.,9208958,2009,Reversibility of symptoms in a conditional mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat tract that affects the MJD1 gene which encodes the ataxin-3 protein. In order to analyze whether symptoms caused by ataxin-3 with an expanded repeat are reversible in vivo, we generated a conditional mouse model of SCA3 using the Tet-Off system. We used a full-length human ataxin-3 cDNA with 77 repeats in order to generate the responder mouse line. After crossbreeding with a PrP promoter mouse line, double transgenic mice developed a progressive neurological phenotype characterized by neuronal dysfunction in the cerebellum, reduced anxiety, hyperactivity, impaired Rotarod performance and lower body weight gain. When ataxin-3 expression was turned off in symptomatic mice in an early disease state, the transgenic mice were indistinguishable from negative controls after 5 months of treatment. These results show that reducing the production of pathogenic ataxin-3 indeed may be a promising approach to treat SCA3, provided that such treatment is applied before irreversible damage has taken place and that it is continued for a sufficiently long time."
17942670,1,Eukaryotic Cell,101130731,2009,A single dicer gene is required for efficient gene silencing associated with two classes of small antisense RNAs in Mucor circinelloides.,"RNA silencing in the zygomycete Mucor circinelloides exhibits uncommon features, such as induction by self-replicative sense transgenes and the accumulation of two size classes of antisense small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). To investigate whether this silencing phenomenon follows the rules of a canonical RNA-silencing mechanism, we used hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-producing constructs as silencing triggers and analyzed the efficiency and stability of silencing in different genetic backgrounds. We show here that the dsRNA-induced silencing mechanism is also associated with the accumulation of two sizes of antisense siRNAs and that this mechanism is not mediated by the previously known dcl-1 (dicer-like) gene, which implies the existence of an additional dicer gene. An M. circinelloides dcl-2 gene was cloned and characterized, and the corresponding null mutant was generated by gene replacement. This mutant is severely impaired in the silencing mechanism induced by self-replicative sense or inverted-repeat transgenes, providing the first genetic evidence of a canonical silencing mechanism in this class of fungus and pointing to a role for dcl-2 in the mechanism. Moreover, a functional dcl-2 gene is required for the normal accumulation of the two sizes of antisense RNAs, as deduced from the analysis of dcl-2(-) transformants containing hpRNA-expressing plasmids. In addition to its critical role in transgene-induced silencing, the dcl-2 gene seems to play a role in the control of vegetative development, since the dcl-2 null mutants showed a significant decrease in their production of asexual spores."
17942686,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Starch granule initiation in Arabidopsis requires the presence of either class IV or class III starch synthases.,"The mechanisms underlying starch granule initiation remain unknown. We have recently reported that mutation of soluble starch synthase IV (SSIV) in Arabidopsis thaliana results in restriction of the number of starch granules to a single, large, particle per plastid, thereby defining an important component of the starch priming machinery. In this work, we provide further evidence for the function of SSIV in the priming process of starch granule formation and show that SSIV is necessary and sufficient to establish the correct number of starch granules observed in wild-type chloroplasts. The role of SSIV in granule seeding can be replaced, in part, by the phylogenetically related SSIII. Indeed, the simultaneous elimination of both proteins prevents Arabidopsis from synthesizing starch, thus demonstrating that other starch synthases cannot support starch synthesis despite remaining enzymatically active. Herein, we describe the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of SSIV and its subchloroplastic localization in specific regions associated with the edges of starch granules. The data presented in this work point to a complex mechanism for starch granule formation and to the different abilities of SSIV and SSIII to support this process in Arabidopsis leaves."

17942705,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Essential role of platelet-activating factor receptor in the pathogenesis of Dengue virus infection.,"Severe dengue infection in humans causes a disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, increased levels of cytokines, increased vascular permeability, hemorrhage, and shock. Treatment is supportive. Activation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) on endothelial cells and leukocytes induces increase in vascular permeability, hypotension, and production of cytokines. We hypothesized that activation of PAFR could account for the major systemic manifestations of dengue infection. Inoculation of adult mice with an adapted strain of Dengue virus caused a systemic disease, with several features of the infection in humans. In PAFR(-/-) mice, there was decreased thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, decreased systemic levels of cytokines, and delay of lethality, when compared with WT infected mice. Treatment with UK-74,505, an orally active PAFR antagonist, prevented the above-mentioned manifestations, as well as hypotension and increased vascular permeability, and decreased lethality, even when started 5 days after virus inoculation. Similar results were obtained with a distinct PAFR antagonist, PCA-4246. Despite decreased disease manifestation, viral loads were similar (PAFR(-/-)) or lower (PAFR antagonist) than in WT mice. Thus, activation of PAFR plays a major role in the pathogenesis of experimental dengue infection, and its blockade prevents more severe disease manifestation after infection with no increase in systemic viral titers, suggesting that there is no interference in the ability of the murine host to deal with the infection. PAFR antagonists are disease-modifying agents in experimental dengue infection."
17947231,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,CD14-Mac-1 interactions in Bacillus anthracis spore internalization by macrophages.,"Anthrax, a potentially lethal disease of animals and humans, is caused by the Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The outermost exosporium layer of B. anthracis spores contains an external hair-like nap formed by the glycoprotein BclA. Recognition of BclA by the integrin Mac-1 promotes spore uptake by professional phagocytes, resulting in the carriage of spores to sites of spore germination and bacterial growth in distant lymphoid organs. We show that CD14 binds to rhamnose residues of BclA and acts as a coreceptor for spore binding by Mac-1. In this process, CD14 induces signals involving TLR2 and PI3k that promote inside-out activation of Mac-1, thereby enhancing spore internalization by macrophages. As observed with mice lacking Mac-1, CD14(-/-) mice are also more resistant than wild-type mice to infection by B. anthracis spores. Additionally, after B. anthracis spore challenge of CD14(-/-) mice, interference with the CD14-mediated signaling pathways results in increased mortality. Our results show that the binding and uptake of B. anthracis spores by phagocytic cells is a dynamic process and involves multiple receptors and signaling pathways."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,A loss-of-function nonsynonymous polymorphism in the osmoregulatory TRPV4 gene is associated with human hyponatremia.,"Disorders of water balance are among the most common and morbid of the electrolyte disturbances, and are reflected clinically as abnormalities in the serum sodium concentration. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is postulated to comprise an element of the central tonicity-sensing mechanism in the mammalian hypothalamus, and is activated by hypotonic stress in vitro. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in the TRPV4 gene gives rise to a Pro-to-Ser substitution at residue 19. We show that this polymorphism is significantly associated with serum sodium concentration and with hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration &lt; or =135 mEq/L) in 2 non-Hispanic Caucasian male populations; in addition, mean serum sodium concentration is lower among subjects with the TRPV4(P19S) allele relative to the wild-type allele. Subjects with the minor allele were 2.4-6.4 times as likely to exhibit hyponatremia as subjects without the minor allele (after inclusion of key covariates). Consistent with these observations, a human TRPV4 channel mutated to incorporate the TRPV4(P19S) polymorphism showed diminished response to hypotonic stress (relative to the wild-type channel) and to the osmotransducing lipid epoxyeicosatrienoic acid in heterologous expression studies. These data suggest that this polymorphism affects TRPV4 function in vivo and likely influences systemic water balance on a population-wide basis."
17947517,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,On the remarkable mechanostability of scaffoldins and the mechanical clamp motif.,"Protein mechanostability is a fundamental biological property that can only be measured by single-molecule manipulation techniques. Such studies have unveiled a variety of highly mechanostable modules (mainly of the Ig-like, beta-sandwich type) in modular proteins subjected to mechanical stress from the cytoskeleton and the metazoan cell-cell interface. Their mechanostability is often attributed to a &quot;mechanical clamp&quot; of secondary structure (a patch of backbone hydrogen bonds) fastening their ends. Here we investigate the nanomechanics of scaffoldins, an important family of scaffolding proteins that assembles a variety of cellulases into the so-called cellulosome, a microbial extracellular nanomachine for cellulose adhesion and degradation. These proteins anchor the microbial cell to cellulose substrates, which makes their connecting region likely to be subjected to mechanical stress. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscopy, polyprotein engineering, and computer simulations, here we show that the cohesin I modules from the connecting region of cellulosome scaffoldins are the most robust mechanical proteins studied experimentally or predicted from the entire Protein Data Bank. The mechanostability of the cohesin modules studied correlates well with their mechanical kinetic stability but not with their thermal stability, and it is well predicted by computer simulations, even coarse-grained. This extraordinary mechanical stability is attributed to 2 mechanical clamps in tandem. Our findings provide the current upper limit of protein mechanostability and establish shear mechanical clamps as a general structural/functional motif widespread in proteins putatively subjected to mechanical stress. These data have important implications for the scaffoldin physiology and for protein design in biotechnology and nanotechnology."

Here, we report the crystal structure of cOTC from the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus hilgardii (Lh-cOTC) refined to 2.1 A resolution. The structure reveals that Lh-cOTC forms a hexameric assembly, which was also confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. The homohexamer, with 32 point group symmetry, represents a new oligomeric state within the members of the ornithine transcarbamylase family that are typically homotrimeric or homododecameric. The C-terminal end from each subunit constitutes a key structural element for the stabilization of the hexameric assembly in solution. Additionally, the structure reveals, for the first time in the ornithine transcarbamylase family, a metal-binding site located at the 3-fold molecular symmetry axis of each trimer."

Procyanidins (Pcy) are oligomeric and polymeric flavonoids formed by catechins and epicatechins monomers trigger apoptosis by activating TRAIL-death receptors in human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells. Here, we investigated whether the apoptotic process triggered by apple procyanidins involving the up-regulation of TRAIL-death receptors DR4/DR5 at the cell surface was dependent on cell membrane lipid-raft formation. We report that Pcy-induced apoptosis was enhanced in presence of nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering compound inhibiting lipid-raft formation, without changing DR4/DR5 receptor expression. Treatment of SW480 cells with TRAIL caused a 3.5-fold increased level of caveolin together with a 2- to 2.5-fold increased amount of DR4/DR5 proteins in lipid rafts. Pcy-treatment did not induce any alteration in the expression of DR4/DR5 proteins as well as of caveolin present in lipid-raft fractions. Pcy induced an activation of TRAIL-death receptor-mediated apoptosis by a mechanism independent of lipid-raft formation. These results highlight the potential of Pcy as a direct activator of TRAIL-death receptors in cell membrane even in the absence of lipid rafts."

In view of this, the three-dimensional structure of the H1N1-M2 channel was developed based on the primary sequence taken from a patient recently infected by the H1N1 (swine flu) virus. With an explicit water-membrane environment, molecular docking studies were performed for amantadine and rimantadine, the two commercial drugs generally used to treat influenza A infection. It was found that their binding affinity to the H1N1-M2 channel is significantly lower than that to the H5N1-M2 channel, fully consistent with the recent report that the H1N1 swine virus was resistant to the two drugs. The findings and the relevant analysis reported here might provide useful structural insights for developing effective drugs against the new swine flu virus."
17951432,1,Cell,413066,2009,A class of dynamin-like GTPases involved in the generation of the tubular ER network.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of tubules that are shaped by the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, but how the tubules form an interconnected network is unknown. Here, we show that mammalian atlastins, which are dynamin-like, integral membrane GTPases, interact with the tubule-shaping proteins. The atlastins localize to the tubular ER and are required for proper network formation in vivo and in vitro. Depletion of the atlastins or overexpression of dominant-negative forms inhibits tubule interconnections. The Sey1p GTPase in S. cerevisiae is likely a functional ortholog of the atlastins; it shares the same signature motifs and membrane topology and interacts genetically and physically with the tubule-shaping proteins. Cells simultaneously lacking Sey1p and a tubule-shaping protein have ER morphology defects. These results indicate that formation of the tubular ER network depends on conserved dynamin-like GTPases. Since atlastin-1 mutations cause a common form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, we suggest ER-shaping defects as a neuropathogenic mechanism."

Cell,9802571,2009,Myosin VI dimerization triggers an unfolding of a three-helix bundle in order to extend its reach.,"Myosin VI challenges the prevailing theory of how myosin motors move on actin: the lever arm hypothesis. While the reverse directionality and large powerstroke of myosin VI can be attributed to unusual properties of a subdomain of the motor (converter with a unique insert), these adaptations cannot account for the large step size on actin. Either the lever arm hypothesis needs modification, or myosin VI has some unique form of extension of its lever arm. We determined the structure of the region immediately distal to the lever arm of the motor and show that it is a three-helix bundle. Based on C-terminal truncations that display the normal range of step sizes on actin, CD, fluorescence studies, and a partial deletion of the bundle, we demonstrate that this bundle unfolds upon dimerization of two myosin VI monomers. This unconventional mechanism generates an extension of the lever arm of myosin VI."

The ectodomain of MuSK comprises three immunoglobulin-like domains and a cysteine-rich domain (Fz-CRD) related to those in Frizzled proteins, the receptors for Wnts. Here, we report the crystal structure of the MuSK Fz-CRD at 2.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a five-disulfide-bridged domain similar to CRDs of Frizzled proteins but with a divergent C-terminal region. An asymmetric dimer present in the crystal structure implicates surface hydrophobic residues that may function in homotypic or heterotypic interactions to mediate co-clustering of MuSK, rapsyn, and acetylcholine receptors at the NMJ."

17954916,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Definition of the residues required for the interaction between glycine-extended gastrin and transferrin in vitro.,"Transferrin is the main iron transport protein found in the circulation, and the level of transferrin saturation in the blood is an important indicator of iron status. The peptides amidated gastrin(17) (Gamide) and glycine-extended gastrin(17) (Ggly) are well known for their roles in controlling acid secretion and as growth factors in the gastrointestinal tract. Several lines of evidence, including the facts that transferrin binds gastrin, that gastrins bind ferric ions, and that the level of expression of gastrins positively correlates with transferrin saturation, suggest the possible involvement of the transferrin-gastrin interaction in iron homeostasis. In the present work, the interaction between gastrins and transferrin has been characterized by surface plasmon resonance and covalent crosslinking. First, an interaction between iron-free apo-transferrin and Gamide or Ggly was observed. The fact that no interaction was observed in the presence of the chelator EDTA suggested that the gastrin-ferric ion complex was the interacting species. Moreover, removal of ferric ions with EDTA reduced the stability of the complex between apo-transferrin and gastrins, and no interaction was observed between Gamide or Ggly and diferric transferrin. Second, some or all of glutamates at positions 8-10 of the Ggly molecule, together with the C-terminal domain, were necessary for the interaction with apo-transferrin. Third, monoferric transferrin mutants incapable of binding iron in either the N-terminal or C-terminal lobe still bound Ggly. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gastrin peptides bind to nonligand residues within the open cleft in each lobe of transferrin and are involved in iron loading of transferrin in vivo."

Here, we found that mutant huntingtin forms aggregates in the cytoplasm and reduces insulin secretion from huntingtin transfected pancreatic beta cell lines, NIT-1 cells. Activity of the pro-survival factor, Akt, is enhanced in these cells, which might improve the maintenance of insulin content. Overexpression of heat shock protein 40 (HSP40) inhibits aggregation, reverses impaired insulin release, and blocks the enhancement of Akt activity. These results suggest that impairment of beta cells is mostly linked with the aggregate formation of mutant huntingtin, and that HSP40 ameliorates the malfunction of pancreatic beta cells by inhibiting aggregation."

Res.,47103,2009,Using lidocaine and benzocaine to link sodium channel molecular conformations to state-dependent antiarrhythmic drug affinity.,"RATIONALE: Lidocaine and other antiarrhythmic drugs bind in the inner pore of voltage-gated Na channels and affect gating use-dependently. A phenylalanine in domain IV, S6 (Phe1759 in Na(V)1.5), modeled to face the inner pore just below the selectivity filter, is critical in use-dependent drug block. OBJECTIVE: Measurement of gating currents and concentration-dependent availability curves to determine the role of Phe1759 in coupling of drug binding to the gating changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The measurements showed that replacement of Phe1759 with a nonaromatic residue permits clear separation of action of lidocaine and benzocaine into 2 components that can be related to channel conformations. One component represents the drug acting as a voltage-independent, low-affinity blocker of closed channels (designated as lipophilic block), and the second represents high-affinity, voltage-dependent block of open/inactivated channels linked to stabilization of the S4s in domains III and IV (designated as voltage-sensor inhibition) by Phe1759. A homology model for how lidocaine and benzocaine bind in the closed and open/inactivated channel conformation is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 components, lipophilic block and voltage-sensor inhibition, can explain the differences in estimates between tonic and open-state/inactivated-state affinities, and they identify how differences in affinity for the 2 binding conformations can control use-dependence, the hallmark of successful antiarrhythmic drugs."

Sci.,7703701,2010,Analysis of postnatal eye development in the mouse with high-resolution small animal magnetic resonance imaging.,"PURPOSE: Studies of myopia in mice have been complicated by the difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements of small changes observed in the growing mouse eye in vivo and the lack of data on refractive eye development. The purpose of this study was to carry out an in vivo high-resolution analysis of mouse eye growth and refractive development. METHODS: High-resolution small animal magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution infrared photorefraction were used to analyze refractive development in postnatal day (P)21 to P89 C57BL/6J mice. RESULTS: The growth of the mouse eye decelerated after P40. The eye maintained a slightly prolate shape during growth. The anterior chamber growth exhibited a similar pattern, whereas the corneal radius of curvature (CRC) increased linearly. The growth rate of the lens remained constant until P89. The lens &quot;overgrew&quot; the eye at P40, resulting in a decline in vitreous chamber depth. Mice showed myopic refractive errors at a younger age (-13.2 +/- 2.0 D; mean +/- SD, P21). The refractive errors stabilized around emmetropic values by P32 and remained emmetropic until P40. Mice became progressively hyperopic with age (+1.2 +/- 1.7 D, P67; +3.6 +/- 2.3 D, P89). CONCLUSIONS: Development of ocular components in the mouse is similar to that of the tree shrew but different from that of higher primates and humans. Primary differences can be attributed to the age-related changes of the crystalline lens and CRC. In spite of these differences, mice appear to be able to achieve and maintain emmetropic refractive status at P32 to P40."
17960875,1,RNA,9509184,2009,Metazoan stress granule assembly is mediated by P-eIF2alpha-dependent and -independent mechanisms.,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic bodies wherein translationally silenced mRNAs are recruited for triage in response to environmental stress. We report that Drosophila cells form SGs in response to arsenite and heat shock. Drosophila SGs, like mammalian SGs, are distinct from but adjacent to processing bodies (PBs, sites of mRNA silencing and decay), require polysome disassembly, and are in dynamic equilibrium with polysomes. We further examine the role of the two Drosophila eIF2alpha kinases, PEK and GCN2, in regulating SG formation in response to heat and arsenite stress. While arsenite-induced SGs are dependent upon eIF2alpha phosphorylation, primarily via PEK, heat-induced SGs are phospho-eIF2alpha-independent. In contrast, heat-induced SGs require eIF2alpha phosphorylation in mammalian cells, as non-phosphorylatable eIF2alpha Ser51Ala mutant murine embryonic fibroblasts do not form SGs even after severe heat shock. These results suggest that mammals evolved alternative mechanisms for dealing with thermal stress."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Nucleophosmin and nucleolin regulate K-Ras plasma membrane interactions and MAPK signal transduction.,"The spatial organization of Ras proteins into nanoclusters on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is essential for high fidelity signaling through the MAPK pathway. Here we identify two selective regulators of K-Ras nanoclustering from a proteomic screen for K-Ras interacting proteins. Nucleophosmin (NPM) and nucleolin are predominantly localized to the nucleolus but also have extranuclear functions. We show that a subset of NPM and nucleolin localizes to the inner leaflet of plasma membrane and forms specific complexes with K-Ras but not other Ras isoforms. Active GTP-loaded and inactive GDP-loaded K-Ras both interact with NPM, although NPM-K-Ras binding is increased by growth factor receptor activation. NPM and nucleolin both stabilize K-Ras levels on the plasma membrane, but NPM concurrently increases the clustered fraction of GTP-K-Ras. The increase in nanoclustered GTP-K-Ras in turn enhances signal gain in the MAPK pathway. In summary these results reveal novel extranucleolar functions for NPM and nucleolin as regulators of K-Ras nanocluster formation and activation of the MAPK pathway. The study also identifies a new class of K-Ras nanocluster regulator that operates independently of the structural scaffold galectin-3."

We investigated the role of IL-17 receptor signaling in atherosclerosis and transplanted LDLr deficient recipient mice with IL-17R deficient bone marrow. Induction of atherosclerosis by Western-type diet induced a 46% reduction in lesion size in the aortic root and the plaque composition revealed no significant changes in collagen content and neutrophil counts, but a reduction in mast cell number and an increase in macrophage number. In addition, we observed a decrease in anti-oxLDL antibodies of the IgG class upon IL-17R BMT, while introduction of IL-17R deficient bone marrow resulted in a reduced IL-6 production and an increased IL-10 production. In conclusion, signaling via the IL-17 receptor in bone marrow derived cells enhances the process of atherosclerosis."
17962807,1,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Correlations between RNA and protein expression profiles in 23 human cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: The Central Dogma of biology holds, in famously simplified terms, that DNA makes RNA makes proteins, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding the general, genome-wide correlation between levels of RNA and corresponding proteins. Therefore, to assess degrees of this correlation we compared the RNA profiles (determined using both cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays) and protein profiles (determined immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays) of 1066 gene products in 23 human cell lines. RESULTS: A high mean correlation coefficient (0.52) was obtained from the pairwise comparison of RNA levels determined by the two platforms. Significant correlations, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.445, between protein and RNA levels were also obtained for a third of the specific gene products. However, the correlation coefficients between levels of RNA and protein products of specific genes varied widely, and the mean correlations between the protein and corresponding RNA levels determined using the cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays were 0.25 and 0.20, respectively. CONCLUSION: Significant correlations were found in one third of the examined RNA species and corresponding proteins. These results suggest that RNA profiling might provide indirect support to antibodies' specificity, since whenever a evident correlation between the RNA and protein profiles exists, this can sustain that the antibodies used in the immunoassay recognized their cognate antigens."
17962809,1,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,Natural history of malignant bone disease in breast cancer and the use of cumulative mean functions to measure skeletal morbidity.,"BACKGROUND: Bone metastases are a common cause of skeletal morbidity in patients with advanced cancer. The pattern of skeletal morbidity is complex, and the number of skeletal complications is influenced by the duration of survival. Because many patients with cancer die before trial completion, there is a need for survival-adjusted methods to accurately assess the effects of treatment on skeletal morbidity. METHODS: Recently, a survival-adjusted cumulative mean function model has been generated that can provide an intuitive graphic representation of skeletal morbidity throughout a study. This model was applied to the placebo-control arm of a pamidronate study in patients with malignant bone disease from breast cancer. RESULTS: Analysis by bone lesion location showed that spinal metastases were associated with the highest cumulative mean incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs), followed by chest and pelvic metastases. Metastases located in the extremities were associated with an intermediate incidence of SREs, and those in the skull were associated with the lowest incidence of SREs. CONCLUSION: Application of this model to data from the placebo arm of this trial revealed important insight into the natural history of skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases. Based on these observations, treatment for the prevention of SREs is warranted regardless of lesion location except for metastases on the skull."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,"Peroxisomal and mitochondrial status of two murine oligodendrocytic cell lines (158N, 158JP): potential models for the study of peroxisomal disorders associated with dysmyelination processes.","In some neurodegenerative disorders (leukodystrophies) characterized by myelin alterations, the defect of peroxisomal functions on myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) are poorly understood. The development of in vitro models is fundamental to understanding the physiopathogenesis of these diseases. We characterized two immortalized murine oligodendrocyte cell lines: a normal (158N) and a jimpy (158JP) cell line mutated for the proteolipid protein PLP/DM20. Fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and western blotting analysis allow to identify major myelin proteins (PLP colocalizing with mitochondria; myelin basic protein), oligodendrocyte (CNPase and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), and peroxisomal markers [adrenoleukodystrophy protein, PMP70, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), l-peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, and catalase]. Using electron microscopy, peroxisomes were identified in the two cell lines. Gene expression (ATP-binding cassette, Abcd1, Abcd2, Abcd3, and Acox1) involved in peroxisomal transport or beta-oxidation of fatty acids was evaluated using quantitative PCR. 4-phenylbutyrate treatment increases expression of ACOX1, l-peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, PLP, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and CNPase, mainly in 158N cells. In both cell lines, 4-phenylbutyrate-induced ACOX1 and catalase activities while only Abcd2 gene was up-regulated in 158JP. Moreover, the higher mitochondrial activity and content observed in 158JP were associated with higher glutathione content and increased basal production of reactive oxygen species revealing different redox statuses. Altogether, 158N and 158JP cells will permit studying the relationships between peroxisomal defects, mitochondrial activity, and oligodendrocyte functions."
17965023,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Following mitochondrial footprints through a long mucosal path to lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are reported in different tumors. However, there is no information on the temporal development of the mtDNA mutations/content alteration and their extent in normal and abnormal mucosa continuously exposed to tobacco smoke in lung cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: We examined the pattern of mtDNA alteration (mtDNA mutation and content index) in 25 airway mucosal biopsies, corresponding tumors and normal lymph nodes obtained from three patients with primary lung cancers. In addition, we examined the pattern of mtDNA mutation in corresponding tumors and normal lymph nodes obtained from eight other patients with primary lung cancers. The entire 16.5 kb mitochondrial genome was sequenced on Affymetrix Mitochip v2.0 sequencing platform in every sample. To examine mtDNA content index, we performed real-time PCR analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The airway mucosal biopsies obtained from three lung cancer patients were histopathologically negative but exhibited multiple clonal mtDNA mutations detectable in the corresponding tumors. One of the patients was operated twice for the removal of tumor from the right upper and left lower lobe respectively within a span of two years. Both of these tumors exhibited twenty identical mtDNA mutations. MtDNA content increased significantly (P&lt;0.001) in the lung cancer and all the histologically negative mucosal biopsies except one compared to the control lymph node. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results document the extent of massive clonal patches that develop in lifetime smokers and ultimately give rise to clinically significant cancers. These observations shed light on the extent of disease in the airway of smokers traceable through mtDNA mutation. MtDNA mutation could be a reliable tool for molecular assessment of respiratory epithelium exposed to continuous smoke as well as disease detection and monitoring. Functional analysis of the pathogenic mtDNA mutations may be useful to understand their role in lung tumorigenesis."
17965176,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Inflammation and proliferation act together to mediate intestinal cell fusion.,"Cell fusion between circulating bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and non-hematopoietic cells is well documented in various tissues and has recently been suggested to occur in response to injury. Here we illustrate that inflammation within the intestine enhanced the level of BMDC fusion with intestinal progenitors. To identify important microenvironmental factors mediating intestinal epithelial cell fusion, we performed bone marrow transplantation into mouse models of inflammation and stimulated epithelial proliferation. Interestingly, in a non-injury model or in instances where inflammation was suppressed, an appreciable baseline level of fusion persisted. This suggests that additional mediators of cell fusion exist. A rigorous temporal analysis of early post-transplantation cellular dynamics revealed that GFP-expressing donor cells first trafficked to the intestine coincident with a striking increase in epithelial proliferation, advocating for a required fusogenic state of the host partner. Directly supporting this hypothesis, induction of augmented epithelial proliferation resulted in a significant increase in intestinal cell fusion. Here we report that intestinal inflammation and epithelial proliferation act together to promote cell fusion. While the physiologic impact of cell fusion is not yet known, the increased incidence in an inflammatory and proliferative microenvironment suggests a potential role for cell fusion in mediating the progression of intestinal inflammatory diseases and cancer."

A custom-built DNA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip containing 3404 SNPs was used to test genomic DNA from myeloma patients classified by the extent of bone disease. Correlations identified with a Total Therapy 2 (TT2) (Arkansas) data set were validated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) data sets. Univariate correlates with bone disease included: EPHX1, IGF1R, IL-4 and Gsk3beta. SNP signatures were linked to the number of bone lesions, log(2) DKK-1 myeloma cell expression levels and patient survival. Using stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the following SNPs: EPHX1 (P=0.0026); log(2) DKK-1 expression (P=0.0046); serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.0074); Gsk3beta (P=0.02) and TNFSF8 (P=0.04) were linked to bone disease. This assessment of genetic polymorphisms identifies SNPs with both potential biological relevance and utility in prognostic models of myeloma bone disease."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Cornering the fear engram: long-term synaptic changes in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala after fear conditioning.,"Use-dependent synaptic modifications in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) have been suggested to be the cellular analog of memory trace after pavlovian fear conditioning. However, whether neurophysiological changes in the LA are produced as a direct consequence of associative learning awaits additional proof. Using microstimulation of the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus as the conditioned stimulus (CS), we demonstrated that contingent pairings of the brain-stimulation CS and a footshock unconditioned stimulus lead to enhanced synaptic efficacy in the thalamic input to the LA, supporting the hypothesis that localized synaptic alterations underlie fear memory formation."
17968012,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Human telomeres that contain (CTAGGG)n repeats show replication dependent instability in somatic cells and the male germline.,"A number of different processes that impact on telomere length dynamics have been identified but factors that affect the turnover of repeats located proximally within the telomeric DNA are poorly defined. We have identified a particular repeat type (CTAGGG) that is associated with an extraordinarily high mutation rate (20% per gamete) in the male germline. The mutation rate is affected by the length and sequence homogeneity of the (CTAGGG)n array. This level of instability was not seen with other sequence-variant repeats, including the TCAGGG repeat type that has the same composition. Telomeres carrying a (CTAGGG)n array are also highly unstable in somatic cells with the mutation process resulting in small gains or losses of repeats that also occasionally result in the deletion of the whole (CTAGGG)n array. These sequences are prone to quadruplex formation in vitro but adopt a different topology from (TTAGGG)n (see accompanying article). Interestingly, short (CTAGGG)2 oligonucleotides induce a DNA damage response (gammaH2AX foci) as efficiently as (TTAGGG)2 oligos in normal fibroblast cells, suggesting they recruit POT1 from the telomere. Moreover, in vitro assays show that (CTAGGG)n repeats bind POT1 more efficiently than (TTAGGG)n or (TCAGGG)n. We estimate that 7% of human telomeres contain (CTAGGG)n repeats and when present, they create additional problems that probably arise during telomere replication."

Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,"Rosiglitazone prevents sirolimus-induced hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and downregulation of NKCC2 protein expression.","Sirolimus, an antiproliferative immunosuppressant, induces hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Rosiglitazone activates renal sodium- and water-reabsorptive pathways. We evaluated whether sirolimus induces renal wasting of magnesium and potassium, attempting to identify the tubule segments in which this occurs. We tested the hypothesis that reduced expression of the cotransporter NKCC2 forms the molecular basis of this effect and evaluated the possible association between increased urinary excretion of magnesium and renal expression of the epithelial Mg2+ channel TRPM6. We then analyzed whether rosiglitazone attenuates these sirolimus-induced tubular effects. Wistar rats were treated for 14 days with sirolimus (3 mg/kg body wt in drinking water), with or without rosiglitazone (92 mg/kg body wt in food). Protein abundance of NKCC2, aquaporin-2 (AQP2), and TRPM6 was assessed using immunoblotting. Sirolimus-treated animals presented no change in glomerular filtration rate, although there were marked decreases in plasma potassium and magnesium. Sirolimus treatment reduced expression of NKCC2, and this was accompanied by greater urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. In sirolimus-treated animals, AQP2 expression was reduced. Expression of TRPM6 was increased, which might represent a direct stimulatory effect of sirolimus or a compensatory response. The finding that rosiglitazone prevented or attenuated all sirolimus-induced renal tubular defects has potential clinical implications."
17972917,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,The matrix protein of measles virus regulates viral RNA synthesis and assembly by interacting with the nucleocapsid protein.,"The genome of measles virus (MV) is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein and associates with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form the ribonucleoprotein complex. The matrix (M) protein is believed to play an important role in MV assembly by linking the ribonucleoprotein complex with envelope glycoproteins. Analyses using a yeast two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells revealed that the M protein interacts with the N protein and that two leucine residues at the carboxyl terminus of the N protein (L523 and L524) are critical for the interaction. In MV minigenome reporter gene assays, the M protein inhibited viral RNA synthesis only when it was able to interact with the N protein. The N protein colocalized with the M protein at the plasma membrane when the proteins were coexpressed in plasmid-transfected or MV-infected cells. In contrast, the N protein formed small dots in the perinuclear area when it was expressed without the M protein, or it was incapable of interacting with the M protein. Furthermore, a recombinant MV possessing a mutant N protein incapable of interacting with the M protein grew much less efficiently than the parental virus. Since the M protein has an intrinsic ability to associate with the plasma membrane, it may retain the ribonucleoprotein complex at the plasma membrane by binding to the N protein, thereby stopping viral RNA synthesis and promoting viral particle production. Consequently, our results indicate that the M protein regulates MV RNA synthesis and assembly via its interaction with the N protein."

Virol.,113724,2009,Systemic and mucosal T-lymphocyte activation induced by recombinant adenovirus vaccines in rhesus monkeys.,"The administration of vectors designed to elicited cell-mediated immune responses may have other consequences that are clinically significant. To explore this possibility, we evaluated T-cell activation during the first 2 months after recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) prime or boost immunizations in rhesus monkeys. We also evaluated the kinetics of T-lymphocyte activation in both the systemic and the mucosal compartments after rAd5 administration in monkeys with preexisting immunity to Ad5. The rAd5 immunization induced lower-frequency Gag epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in the colonic mucosa than in the peripheral blood. There was evidence of an expansion of the simian immunodeficiency virus Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, but not the Ad5 hexon-specific T-cell responses, following a homologous rAd5 boost. A striking but transient T-lymphocyte activation in both the systemic and the mucosal compartments of rhesus monkeys was observed after rAd5 immunization. These findings indicate that the administration of a vaccine vector such as Ad5 can induce a global activation of T cells."
17974954,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Functional interaction between Epstein-Barr virus replication protein Zta and host DNA damage response protein 53BP1.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; human herpesvirus 4) poses major clinical problems worldwide. Following primary infection, EBV enters a form of long-lived latency in B lymphocytes, expressing few viral genes, and it persists for the lifetime of the host with sporadic bursts of viral replication. The switch between latency and replication is governed by the action of a multifunctional viral protein Zta (also called BZLF1, ZEBRA, and Z). Using a global proteomic approach, we identified a host DNA damage repair protein that specifically interacts with Zta: 53BP1. 53BP1 is intimately connected with the ATM signal transduction pathway, which is activated during EBV replication. The interaction of 53BP1 with Zta requires the C-terminal ends of both proteins. A series of Zta mutants that show a wild-type ability to perform basic functions of Zta, such as dimer formation, interaction with DNA, and the transactivation of viral genes, were shown to have lost the ability to induce the viral lytic cycle. Each of these mutants also is compromised in the C-terminal region for interaction with 53BP1. In addition, the knockdown of 53BP1 expression reduced viral replication, suggesting that the association between Zta and 53BP1 is involved in the viral replication cycle."

Cell,9201390,2009,"mTrs130 is a component of a mammalian TRAPPII complex, a Rab1 GEF that binds to COPI-coated vesicles.","The GTPase Rab1 regulates endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi and early Golgi traffic. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) or factors that activate Rab1 at these stages of the secretory pathway are currently unknown. Trs130p is a subunit of the yeast TRAPPII (transport protein particle II) complex, a multisubunit tethering complex that is a GEF for the Rab1 homologue Ypt1p. Here, we show that mammalian Trs130 (mTrs130) is a component of an analogous TRAPP complex in mammalian cells, and we describe for the first time the role that this complex plays in membrane traffic. mTRAPPII is enriched on COPI (Coat Protein I)-coated vesicles and buds, but not Golgi cisternae, and it specifically activates Rab1. In addition, we find that mTRAPPII binds to gamma1COP, a COPI coat adaptor subunit. The depletion of mTrs130 by short hairpin RNA leads to an increase of vesicles in the vicinity of the Golgi and the accumulation of cargo in an early Golgi compartment. We propose that mTRAPPII is a Rab1 GEF that tethers COPI-coated vesicles to early Golgi membranes."
17981999,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Helenalin suppresses essential immune functions of activated CD4+ T cells by multiple mechanisms.,"Helenalin is a naturally occuring sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Arnica montana and Arnica chamissonis ssp. foliosa. Helenalin and its derivatives are known for anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting NF-kappaB and telomerase activity and impairing protein and DNA synthesis, suggesting that helenalin is a potential candidate for the treatment of deregulated and unwanted T cell-mediated immune responses. Here we show that helenalin induces apoptosis in activated CD4+ T cells by triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis is accompanied by rapid stabilization of p53, nuclear localization of p53 and AIF, and an increase in ROS production that results in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Activated CD4+ T cells which survive exposure to helenalin undergo inhibition of proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest is accompanied by the accumulation of cell cycle regulator proteins p21(WAF/CIP1), p2(KIP1) and cyclin D2, whereas abundance of cyclin A and B(1) is decreased. Cell surface expression of the activation-associated receptors CD25, CD27, CD28, CD120b as well as production of IL-2 are impaired. Transcriptional activation of genes encoding for CD25, IL-2 and IFN-gamma is mediated by transcription factors of the NFAT family, and we demonstrate that helenalin suppresses nuclear translocation of NFATc2 in activated CD4+ T cells. Thus, helenalin can be defined as a new immunosuppressive compound suited for the treatment of deregulated and unwanted T cell-mediated immune responses."
17984067,1,Mol. Plant Microbe Interact.,9107902,2009,The majority of the type III effector inventory of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 can suppress plant immunity.,"The Pseudomonas syringae type III protein secretion system (T3SS) and the type III effectors it injects into plant cells are required for plant pathogenicity and the ability to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR). The HR is a programmed cell death that is associated with effector-triggered immunity (ETI). A primary function of P. syringae type III effectors appears to be the suppression of ETI and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), which is induced by conserved molecules on microorganisms. We reported that seven type III effectors from P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 were capable of suppressing an HR induced by P. fluorescens(pHIR11) and have now tested 35 DC3000 type III effectors in this assay, finding that the majority of them can suppress the HR induced by HopA1. One newly identified type III effector with particularly strong HR suppression activity was HopS2. We used the pHIR11 derivative pLN1965, which lacks hopA1, in related assays and found that a subset of the type III effectors that suppressed HopA1-induced ETI also suppressed an ETI response induced by AvrRpm1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. A. thaliana plants expressing either HopAO1 or HopF2, two type III effectors that suppressed the HopA1-induced HR, were reduced in the flagellin-induced PTI response as well as PTI induced by other PAMPs and allowed enhanced in planta growth of P. syringae. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of DC3000 type III effectors can suppress plant immunity. Additionally, the construct pLN1965 will likely be a useful tool in determining whether other type III effectors or effectors from other types of pathogens can suppress either ETI, PTI, or both."
17986610,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Molecular dynamics simulation of phosphorylated KID post-translational modification.,"BACKGROUND: Kinase-inducible domain (KID) as transcriptional activator can stimulate target gene expression in signal transduction by associating with KID interacting domain (KIX). NMR spectra suggest that apo-KID is an unstructured protein. After post-translational modification by phosphorylation, KID undergoes a transition from disordered to well folded protein upon binding to KIX. However, the mechanism of folding coupled to binding is poorly understood. METHODOLOGY: To get an insight into the mechanism, we have performed ten trajectories of explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) for both bound and apo phosphorylated KID (pKID). Ten MD simulations are sufficient to capture the average properties in the protein folding and unfolding. CONCLUSIONS: Room-temperature MD simulations suggest that pKID becomes more rigid and stable upon the KIX-binding. Kinetic analysis of high-temperature MD simulations shows that bound pKID and apo-pKID unfold via a three-state and a two-state process, respectively. Both kinetics and free energy landscape analyses indicate that bound pKID folds in the order of KIX access, initiation of pKID tertiary folding, folding of helix alpha(B), folding of helix alpha(A), completion of pKID tertiary folding, and finalization of pKID-KIX binding. Our data show that the folding pathways of apo-pKID are different from the bound state: the foldings of helices alpha(A) and alpha(B) are swapped. Here we also show that Asn139, Asp140 and Leu141 with large Phi-values are key residues in the folding of bound pKID. Our results are in good agreement with NMR experimental observations and provide significant insight into the general mechanisms of binding induced protein folding and other conformational adjustment in post-translational modification."

Cancer,370635,2009,"The needs of patients with advanced, incurable cancer.","BACKGROUND: Limited research has investigated the specific needs of patients with advanced incurable cancer. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of perceived needs among this population. METHODS: Medical specialists from two regions in New South Wales, Australia, identified patients with advanced, incurable cancer, who were estimated to have a life expectancy of &lt;2 years and were not receiving formal palliative care. Of the 418 eligible patients, 246 (59%) consented to participate. Consenting patients completed the Needs Assessment for Advanced Cancer Patients questionnaire, which has demonstrable validity and reliability. Patients' perceived needs were assessed across the seven domains of the questionnaire: psychological, daily living, medical communication and information, symptom related, social, spiritual and financial needs. RESULTS: Patients identified the greatest areas of need in relation to psychological and medical communication/information domains. Patients' specific needs were highest in dealing with a lack of energy and tiredness, coping with fears about the cancer spreading, and coping with frustration at not being able to do the things they used to do. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that patients with advanced, incurable cancer have high levels of unmet needs, especially in relation to the areas of psychological and medical communication/information needs. The data have the potential to guide the development of interventions aimed at meeting the current unmet needs of patients with advanced, incurable cancer."

Genet.,9208958,2009,A conserved role for the mitochondrial citrate transporter Sea/SLC25A1 in the maintenance of chromosome integrity.,"Histone acetylation plays essential roles in cell cycle progression, DNA repair, gene expression and silencing. Although the knowledge regarding the roles of acetylation of histone lysine residues is rapidly growing, very little is known about the biochemical pathways providing the nucleus with metabolites necessary for physiological chromatin acetylation. Here, we show that mutations in the scheggia (sea)-encoded Sea protein, the Drosophila ortholog of the human mitochondrial citrate carrier Solute carrier 25 A1 (SLC25A1), impair citrate transport from mitochondria to the cytosol. Interestingly, inhibition of sea expression results in extensive chromosome breakage in mitotic cells and induces an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest associated with a dramatic reduction of global histone acetylation. Notably, loss of SLC25A1 in short interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated human primary fibroblasts also leads to chromosome breaks and histone acetylation defects, suggesting an evolutionary conserved role for Sea/SLC25A1 in the regulation of chromosome integrity. This study therefore provides an intriguing and unexpected link between intermediary metabolism and epigenetic control of genome stability."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,The actin-like MreB cytoskeleton organizes viral DNA replication in bacteria.,"Little is known about the organization or proteins involved in membrane-associated replication of prokaryotic genomes. Here we show that the actin-like MreB cytoskeleton of the distantly related bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis is required for efficient viral DNA replication. Detailed analyses of B. subtilis phage 29 showed that the MreB cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in organizing phage DNA replication at the membrane. Thus, phage double-stranded DNA and components of the 29 replication machinery localize in peripheral helix-like structures in a cytoskeleton-dependent way. Importantly, we show that MreB interacts directly with the 29 membrane-protein p16.7, responsible for attaching viral DNA at the cell membrane. Altogether, the results reveal another function for the MreB cytoskeleton and describe a mechanism by which viral DNA replication is organized at the bacterial membrane."
17991777,1,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Genome-wide computational identification of functional RNA elements in Trypanosoma brucei.,"BACKGROUND: Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is the dominant regulatory mechanism in trypanosomatids as their mRNAs are transcribed from polycistronic units. A few cis-acting RNA elements in 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs have been identified in trypanosomatids, which affect the mRNA stability or translation rate in different life stages of these parasites. Other functional RNAs (fRNAs) also play essential roles in these organisms. However, there has been no genome-wide analysis for identification of fRNAs in trypanosomatids. RESULTS: Functional RNAs, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and cis-acting RNA elements involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, were predicted based on two independent computational analyses of the genome of Trypanosoma brucei. In the first analysis, the predicted candidate ncRNAs were identified based on conservation with the related trypanosomatid Leishmania braziliensis. This prediction had a substantially low estimated false discovery rate, and a considerable number of the predicted ncRNAs represented novel classes with unknown functions. In the second analysis, we identified a number of function-specific regulatory motifs, based on which we devised a classifier that can be used for homology-independent function prediction in T. brucei. CONCLUSION: This first genome-wide analysis of fRNAs in trypanosomatids restricts the search space of experimental approaches and, thus, can significantly expedite the process of characterization of these elements. Our classifier for function prediction based on cis-acting regulatory elements can also, in combination with other methods, provide the means for homology-independent annotation of trypanosomatid genomes."

This is the second case of a protein undergoing unbiased cold denaturation. Comparison of the stability curves in buffer and in crowded conditions shows that it is possible to measure thermodynamics parameters for unfolding even when proteins aggregate at high temperature. The use of confinement in polyacrylamide gels, with the addition of polyethylene glycol, allows easy access to subzero temperatures that might enable studies of cold denaturation of many proteins."
17997968,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Irinotecan therapy and molecular targets in colorectal cancer: a systemic review.,"Irinotecan is the second line chemotherapy for advanced stage colorectal cancer (CRC) after failure of first line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The aim of this review is to analyse the data on irinotecan as second line chemotherapy for advanced CRC and the potential roles of the molecular markers, p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the management of advanced CRC. Thus, the English literature from 1980 to 2008 concerning irinotecan, p53, VEGF and CRC was reviewed. On review, Phase II and III clinical trials showed that irinotecan improves pain-free survival, quality of life, 1-year survival, progression-free survival and overall survival in advanced CRC. p53 and VEGF were expressed in CRC and had a predictive power of aggressive clinical behaviour in CRC. Irinotecan sensitizes p53 wild type, mutant and null cells to Fas-mediated cell apoptosis in CRC cells. Wild type p53 cells were more sensitive to irinotecan than mutated p53. Irinotecan has an anti-VEGF effect inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, increasing apoptosis and reducing microvascular density which is only limited by irinotecan toxicity levels. To conclude, irinotecan improves the patient's quality of life and the survival rates of patients with advanced CRC. p53 and VEGF status of the patients' tumour is likely to affect the responsiveness of CRC to irinotecan. It is recommended that studies of the expression of these molecular markers in relation to chemo-responsiveness of irinotecan should be carried out for better management of patients with advanced CRC."
17997974,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Tolerance induction to cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase by hepatic AAV gene transfer: implications for antigen presentation and immunotoxicity.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic gene transfer, in particular using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, has been shown to induce immune tolerance to several protein antigens. This approach has been exploited in animal models of inherited protein deficiency for systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. Adequate levels of transgene expression in hepatocytes induce a suppressive T cell response, thereby promoting immune tolerance. This study addresses the question of whether AAV gene transfer can induce tolerance to a cytoplasmic protein. MAJOR FINDINGS: AAV-2 vector-mediated hepatic gene transfer for expression of cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) was performed in immune competent mice, followed by a secondary beta-gal gene transfer with E1/E3-deleted adenoviral Ad-LacZ vector to provoke a severe immunotoxic response. Transgene expression from the AAV-2 vector in approximately 2% of hepatocytes almost completely protected from inflammatory T cell responses against beta-gal, eliminated antibody formation, and significantly reduced adenovirus-induced hepatotoxicity. Consequently, approximately 10% of hepatocytes continued to express beta-gal 45 days after secondary Ad-LacZ gene transfer, a time point when control mice had lost all Ad-LacZ derived expression. Suppression of inflammatory T cell infiltration in the liver and liver damage was linked to specific transgene expression and was not seen for secondary gene transfer with Ad-GFP. A combination of adoptive transfer studies and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated induction of Treg that actively suppressed CD8(+) T cell responses to beta-gal and that was amplified in liver and spleen upon secondary Ad-LacZ gene transfer. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that tolerance induction by hepatic AAV gene transfer does not require systemic delivery of the transgene product and that expression of a cytoplasmic neo-antigen in few hepatocytes can induce Treg and provide long-term suppression of inflammatory responses and immunotoxicity."
17998537,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Human mesenchymal stem cells self-renew and differentiate according to a deterministic hierarchy.,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) have been isolated from a variety of connective tissues, and are commonly called &quot;mesenchymal stem cells&quot; (MSCs). A stem cell is defined as having robust clonal self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential. Accordingly, the term &quot;MSC&quot; has been criticised, as there is little data demonstrating self-renewal of definitive single-cell-derived (SCD) clonal populations from a mesenchymal cell source. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that a tractable MPC population, human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs), was capable of multilineage differentiation in vitro and, more importantly, contributed to rapid connective tissue healing in vivo by producing bone, cartilage and fibrous stroma. Furthermore, HUCPVCs exhibit a high clonogenic frequency, allowing us to isolate definitive SCD parent and daughter clones from mixed gender suspensions as determined by Y-chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of the multilineage differentiation capacity of SCD parent clones and daughter clones enabled us to formulate a new hierarchical schema for MSC self-renewal and differentiation in which a self-renewing multipotent MSC gives rise to more restricted self-renewing progenitors that gradually lose differentiation potential until a state of complete restriction to the fibroblast is reached."
17998538,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Asic3(-/-) female mice with hearing deficit affects social development of pups.,"BACKGROUND: Infant crying is an important cue for mothers to respond adequately. Inappropriate response to infant crying can hinder social development in infants. In rodents, the pup-mother interaction largely depends on pup's calls. Mouse pups emit high frequency to ultrasonic vocalization (2-90 kHz) to communicate with their dam for maternal care. However, little is known about how the maternal response to infant crying or pup calls affects social development over the long term. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 3 (Asic3(-/-)) to create a hearing deficit to probe the effect of caregiver hearing on maternal care and adolescent social development. Female Asic3(-/-) mice showed elevated hearing thresholds for low to ultrasonic frequency (4-32 kHz) on auditory brain stem response, which thus hindered their response to their pups' wriggling calls and ultrasonic vocalization, as well as their retrieval of pups. In adolescence, pups reared by Asic3(-/-) mice showed a social deficit in juvenile social behaviors as compared with those reared by wild-type or heterozygous dams. The social-deficit phenotype in juvenile mice reared by Asic3(-/-) mice was associated with the reduced serotonin transmission of the brain. However, Asic3(-/-) pups cross-fostered to wild-type dams showed rescued social deficit. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Inadequate response to pups' calls as a result of ASIC3-dependent hearing loss confers maternal deficits in caregivers and social development deficits in their young."

In this study, we found that the distributions of lymphocytes obtained from patients with SLE or SLE with renal disease (RSLE) were reduced in the G(0)/G(1) phase and were elevated in the S phase after phytohemagglutinin treatment. Increased expression of CDK2 and decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27(Kip1) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) were observed in RSLE and SLE lymphocytes. The phosphorylation levels of Akt473 and GSK3beta (ser9) were increased in lymphocytes from the patients. Moreover, inhibition of GSK3beta with lithium chloride or SB216763 induced T cell proliferation, and the most significant effects were observed in RSLE lymphocytes. These results indicate that upregulation of CDKs and downregulation of p27(Kip1) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) increased the proliferation of T lymphocytes in SLE patients. Abnormal activation of the Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathway increased the proliferation of lupus lymphocytes."
18000013,1,J. Clin. Invest.,7802877,2009,Increased local expression of coagulation factor X contributes to the fibrotic response in human and murine lung injury.,"Uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade contributes to the pathophysiology of several conditions, including acute and chronic lung diseases. Coagulation zymogens are considered to be largely derived from the circulation and locally activated in response to tissue injury and microvascular leak. Here we report that expression of coagulation factor X (FX) is locally increased in human and murine fibrotic lung tissue, with marked immunostaining associated with bronchial and alveolar epithelia. FXa was a potent inducer of the myofibroblast differentiation program in cultured primary human adult lung fibroblasts via TGF-beta activation that was mediated by proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) and integrin alphavbeta5. PAR1, alphavbeta5, and alpha-SMA colocalized to fibrotic foci in lung biopsy specimens from individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, we demonstrated a causal link between FXa and fibrosis development by showing that a direct FXa inhibitor attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data support what we believe to be a novel pathogenetic mechanism by which FXa, a central proteinase of the coagulation cascade, is locally expressed and drives the fibrotic response to lung injury. These findings herald a shift in our understanding of the origins of excessive procoagulant activity and place PAR1 central to the cross-talk between local procoagulant signaling and tissue remodeling."
18000057,1,Genes Dev.,8711660,2009,Striking the balance between PTEN and PDK1: it all depends on the cell context.,"The phosphatidyl-inosital-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is critical for normal brain development and function and is commonly hyperactivated in brain cancer. The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor protein and phosphate-depended kinase 1 (PDK-1) are critical regulators of this pathway. In the July 15, 2009, issue of Genes &amp; Development, Chalhoub and colleagues (pp. 1619-1624) demonstrate PDK1-dependent and PDK1-independent effects of conditional PTEN deletion in the brain, and they identify cell type-specific differences in feedback regulation of the PI3K pathway. These studies provide important insights as to how neurons and glia may differentially regulate PI3K signaling, yielding intriguing clues about targeting PTEN-deficient brain cancers."
18000058,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Evidence for heteromorphic chromatin fibers from analysis of nucleosome interactions.,"The architecture of the chromatin fiber, which determines DNA accessibility for transcription and other template-directed biological processes, remains unknown. Here we investigate the internal organization of the 30-nm chromatin fiber, combining Monte Carlo simulations of nucleosome chain folding with EM-assisted nucleosome interaction capture (EMANIC). We show that at physiological concentrations of monovalent ions, linker histones lead to a tight 2-start zigzag dominated by interactions between alternate nucleosomes (i +/- 2) and sealed by histone N-tails. Divalent ions further compact the fiber by promoting bending in some linker DNAs and hence raising sequential nucleosome interactions (i +/- 1). Remarkably, both straight and bent linker DNA conformations are retained in the fully compact chromatin fiber as inferred from both EMANIC and modeling. This conformational variability is energetically favorable as it helps accommodate DNA crossings within the fiber axis. Our results thus show that the 2-start zigzag topology and the type of linker DNA bending that defines solenoid models may be simultaneously present in a structurally heteromorphic chromatin fiber with uniform 30 nm diameter. Our data also suggest that dynamic linker DNA bending by linker histones and divalent cations in vivo may mediate the transition between tight nucleosome packing within discrete 30-nm fibers and self-associated higher-order chromosomal forms."
18001825,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Structural basis for a human glycosylation disorder caused by mutation of the COG4 gene.,"The proper glycosylation of proteins trafficking through the Golgi apparatus depends upon the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. Defects in COG can cause fatal congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) in humans. The recent discovery of a form of CDG, caused in part by a COG4 missense mutation changing Arg 729 to Trp, prompted us to determine the 1.9 A crystal structure of a Cog4 C-terminal fragment. Arg 729 is found to occupy a key position at the center of a salt bridge network, thereby stabilizing Cog4's small C-terminal domain. Studies in HeLa cells reveal that this C-terminal domain, while not needed for the incorporation of Cog4 into COG complexes, is essential for the proper glycosylation of cell surface proteins. We also find that Cog4 bears a strong structural resemblance to exocyst and Dsl1p complex subunits. These complexes and others have been proposed to function by mediating the initial tethering between transport vesicles and their membrane targets; the emerging structural similarities provide strong evidence of a common evolutionary origin and may reflect shared mechanisms of action."
18003897,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Structural and functional diversity of novel coronin 1C (CRN2) isoforms in muscle.,"Coronin 1C (synonyms: coronin-3, CRN2), a WD40 repeat-containing protein involved in cellular actin dynamics, is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of two novel coronin 1C isoforms, referred to as CRN2i2 and CRN2i3, which also associate with F-actin. Analyses of the coronin 1C gene disclosed a single promoter containing binding sites for myogenic regulatory factors and an alternative first exon 1b present in intron 1, which give rise to the novel isoforms. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate MyoD binding to a region of the CRN2 gene, which contains a highly conserved E-box element in exon 1a. Gel-filtration assays suggest that the largest isoform 3 exists as a monomer, in contrast to isoform 1 and isoform 2 appearing as trimers. CRN2i3, which can be induced by MyoD, is exclusively expressed in well-differentiated myoblasts as well as in mature skeletal muscle tissue. In human skeletal muscle, CRN2i3 is a novel component of postsynaptic neuromuscular junctions and thin filaments of myofibrils. Together, our findings postulate a role for CRN2 isoforms in the structural and functional organization of F-actin in highly ordered protein complexes."
18003900,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Effect of macromolecular crowding on protein binding stability: modest stabilization and significant biological consequences.,"Macromolecular crowding has long been known to significantly affect protein oligomerization, and yet no direct quantitative measurements appear to have been made of its effects on the binding free energy of the elemental step of adding a single subunit. Here, we report the effects of two crowding agents on the binding free energy of two subunits in the Escherichia coli polymerase III holoenzyme. The crowding agents are found, paradoxically, to have only a modest stabilizing effect, of the order of 1 kcal/mol, on the binding of the two subunits. Systematic variations in the level of stabilization with crowder size are nevertheless observed. The data are consistent with theoretical predictions based on atomistic modeling of excluded-volume interactions with crowders. We reconcile the apparent paradox presented by our data by noting that the modest effects of crowding on elemental binding steps are cumulative, and thus lead to substantial stabilization of higher oligomers. Correspondingly, the effects of small variations in the level of crowding during the lifetime of a cell may be magnified, suggesting that crowding may play a role in increased susceptibility to protein aggregation-related diseases with aging."
18003910,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Influence of temperature on low-power upconversion in rubbery polymer blends.,"The upconverting properties of a dye cocktail composed of palladium(II) octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP, triplet sensitizer) and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA, triplet acceptor/annihilator) were investigated as a function of temperature in several low glass transition temperature (T(g)) polymer hosts including an ethyleneoxide-epichlorohydrin copolymer (EO-EPI) and the polyurethanes Texin 270, Texin 285, and Tecoflex EG-80A. Selective excitation of PdOEP at 544 nm in the presence of DPA in these materials resulted in anti-Stokes blue emission from DPA, a consequence of sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) photochemistry, confirmed by the quadratic dependence of the upconverted fluorescence intensity with respect to incident light power. The upconversion process was completely suppressed by cooling a PdOEP/DPA blend film to below the T(g) of the respective polymer. However, the blue emission was clearly visible by the naked eye upon heating these films to room temperature (290 K). Subsequently, the upconverted emission intensity increased with increasing temperature and was found to be completely reversible upon several heating and cooling cycles provided the temperature remained below 400 K. Heating samples above this temperature resulted in unrecoverable failure of the material to produce upconverted photons. The phosphorescence intensity decay of PdOEP in the polymer host, Tecoflex EG-80A, adequately fits to a sum of two exponential functions as well as the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched exponential model. Increasing the temperature of the film increases the complexity and heterogeneity of the system as evidenced by the lower beta values obtained from the KWW model as the temperature increases."
18003914,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Degradation of phosphorylated p53 by viral protein-ECS E3 ligase complex.,"p53-signaling is modulated by viruses to establish a host cellular environment advantageous for their propagation. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic program induces phosphorylation of p53, which prevents interaction with MDM2. Here, we show that induction of EBV lytic program leads to degradation of p53 via an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway independent of MDM2. The BZLF1 protein directly functions as an adaptor component of the ECS (Elongin B/C-Cul2/5-SOCS-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex targeting p53 for degradation. Intringuingly, C-terminal phosphorylation of p53 resulting from activated DNA damage response by viral lytic replication enhances its binding to BZLF1 protein. Purified BZLF1 protein-associated ECS could be shown to catalyze ubiquitination of phospho-mimetic p53 more efficiently than the wild-type in vitro. The compensation of p53 at middle and late stages of the lytic infection inhibits viral DNA replication and production during lytic infection, suggesting that the degradation of p53 is required for efficient viral propagation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a role for the BZLF1 protein-associated ECS ligase complex in regulation of p53 phosphorylated by activated DNA damage signaling during viral lytic infection."
18003919,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Characterization of whole blood gene expression profiles as a sequel to globin mRNA reduction in patients with sickle cell disease.,"Global transcriptome analysis of whole blood RNA using microarrays has been proven to be challenging due to the high abundance of globin transcripts that constitute 70% of whole blood mRNA. This is a particular problem in patients with sickle cell disease, secondary to the high abundance of globin-expressing nucleated red blood cells and reticulocytes in the circulation. In order to accurately measure the steady state blood transcriptome in sickle cell patients we evaluated the efficacy of reducing globin transcripts in PAXgene stabilized RNA for genome-wide transcriptome analyses using microarrays. We demonstrate here by both microarrays and Q-PCR that the globin mRNA depletion method resulted in 55-65 fold reduction in globin transcripts in whole blood collected from healthy volunteers and sickle cell disease patients. This led to an improvement in microarray data quality by reducing data variability, with increased detection rate of expressed genes and improved overlap with the expression signatures of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) preparations. Analysis of differences between the whole blood transcriptome and PBMC transcriptome revealed important erythrocyte genes that participate in sickle cell pathogenesis and compensation. The combination of globin mRNA reduction after whole-blood RNA stabilization represents a robust clinical research methodology for the discovery of biomarkers for hematologic diseases."
18005740,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Novel poly-dopamine adhesive for a halloysite nanotube-Ru(bpy)(3)2+ electrochemiluminescent sensor.,"Herein, for the first time, the electrochemiluminescent sensor based on Ru(bpy)(3) (2+)-modified electrode using dopamine as an adhesive was successfully developed. After halloysite nanotube slurry was cast on a glassy carbon electrode and dried, an alkaline dopamine solution was added on the electrode surface. Initially, polydopamine belts with dimensions of tens to hundreds of nanometers formed via oxidization of the dopamine by ambient oxygen. As the incubation time increased, the nanobelts became broader and then united with each other to form a polydopamine film. The halloysite nanotubes were embedded within the polydopamine film. The above electrode was soaked in Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) aqueous solution to adsorb Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) into the active sites of the halloysite nanotubes via cation-exchange procedure. Through this simple procedure, a Ru(bpy)(3) (2+)-modified electrode was obtained using only 6.25 microg Ru(bpy)(3) (2+), 15.0 microg dopamine, and 9.0 microg halloysite nanotubes. The electrochemistry and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the modified electrode was investigated using tripropylamine (TPA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as co-reactants. The different ECL behaviors of the modified electrode using NTA and TPA as well as the contact angle measurements reflected the hydrophilic character of the electrode. The results indicate that halloysite nanotubes have a high loading capacity for Ru(bpy)(3) (2+) and that dopamine is suitable for the preparation of modified electrodes."
18007599,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Evolution and phylogenetic analysis of full-length VP3 genes of Eastern Mediterranean bluetongue virus isolates.,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the 'type' species of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. The BTV genome is composed of ten linear segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), each of which codes for one of ten distinct viral proteins. Previous phylogenetic comparisons have evaluated variations in genome segment 3 (Seg-3) nucleotide sequence as way to identify the geographical origin (different topotypes) of BTV isolates. The full-length nucleotide sequence of genome Seg-3 was determined for thirty BTV isolates recovered in the eastern Mediterranean region, the Balkans and other geographic areas (Spain, India, Malaysia and Africa). These data were compared, based on molecular variability, positive-selection-analysis and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions (using appropriate substitution models) to 24 previously published sequences, revealing their evolutionary relationships. These analyses indicate that negative selection is a major force in the evolution of BTV, restricting nucleotide variability, reducing the evolutionary rate of Seg-3 and potentially of other regions of the BTV genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the BTV-4 strains isolated over a relatively long time interval (1979-2000), in a single geographic area (Greece), showed a low level of nucleotide diversity, indicating that the virus can circulate almost unchanged for many years. These analyses also show that the recent incursions into south-eastern Europe were caused by BTV strains belonging to two different major-lineages: representing an 'eastern' (BTV-9, -16 and -1) and a 'western' (BTV-4) group/topotype. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these viruses originated from a geographic area to the east and southeast of Greece (including Cyprus and the Middle East), which appears to represent an important ecological niche for the virus that is likely to represent a continuing source of future BTV incursions into Europe."
18007655,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,The effects of tail biopsy for genotyping on behavioral responses to nociceptive stimuli.,"Removal of a small segment of tail at weaning is a common method used to obtain tissue for the isolation of genomic DNA to identify genetically modified mice. When genetically manipulated mice are used for pain research, this practice could result in confounding changes to the animals' responses to noxious stimuli. In this study, we sought to systematically investigate whether tail biopsy representative of that used in standard genotyping methods affects behavioral responses to a battery of tests of nociception. Wild-type littermate C57BL/6J and 129S6 female and male mice received either tail biopsies or control procedural handling at Day 21 after birth and were then tested at 6-9 weeks for mechanical and thermal sensitivity. C57BL/6J mice were also tested in the formalin model of inflammatory pain. In all tests performed (von Frey, Hargreaves, modified Randall Selitto, and formalin), C57BL/6J tail-biopsied animals' behavioral responses were not significantly different from control animals. In 129S6 animals, tail biopsy did not have a significant effect on behavioral responses in either sex to the von Frey and the modified Randall-Selitto tests of mechanical sensitivity. Interestingly, however, both sexes exhibited small but significant differences between tail biopsied and control responses to a radiant heat stimulus. These results indicate that tail biopsy for genotyping purposes has no effect on nocifensive behavioral responses of C57BL/6J mice, and in 129S6 mice, causes only a minor alteration in response to a radiant heat stimulus while other nocifensive behavioral responses are unchanged. The small effect seen is modality- and strain-specific."

Here we examine the statistical distributions of open reading frames (i.e. distribution of start and stop codons) in the fully sequenced genomes of 297 prokaryotes, and 14 eukaryotes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By fitting mixture models to data from whole genome sequences we show that the size-frequency distributions for ORFS are strikingly similar across prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, we show that i) a large fraction (60-80%) of ORF size-frequency distributions can be predicted a priori with a stochastic assembly model based on GC content, and that (ii) size-frequency distributions of the remaining &quot;non-random&quot; ORFs are well-fitted by log-normal or gamma distributions, and similar to the size distributions of annotated proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest stochastic processes have played a primary role in the evolution of genome complexity, and that common processes govern the conservation and loss of functional genomics units in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,TLR triggering on tolerogenic dendritic cells results in TLR2 up-regulation and a reduced proinflammatory immune program.,"Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TDC) offer a promising therapeutic potential to ameliorate autoimmune diseases. Reported to inhibit adaptive immune responses, little is known about their innate immunity receptor repertoire. In this study, we compared three types of human TDC (IL-10-DC, dexamethasone (DX)-DC, and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-DC) by their TLR expression and response to a set of TLR ligands. TDC are endowed with the same TLR set as standard monocyte-derived dendritic cells but respond differentially to the TLR stimuli Pam3CSK4, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, LPS, and flagellin. TDC expressed low or no IL-12-related cytokines and remarkably elevated IL-10 levels. Interestingly, only TDC up-regulated the expression of TLR2 upon stimulation. This boosted the tolerogenic potential of these cells, because IL-10 production was up-regulated in TLR2-stimulated, LPS-primed DX-DC, whereas IL-12 and TNF-alpha secretion remained low. When comparing the TDC subsets, DX-DC and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-DC up-regulated TLR2 irrespective of the TLR triggered, whereas in IL-10-DC this effect was only mediated by LPS. Likewise, DX-DC and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-DC exhibited impaired ability to mature, reduced allostimulatory properties, and hampered capacity to induce Th1 differentiation. Therefore, both DX-DC and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-DC display the strongest tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory features and might be most suitable tools for the treatment of autoimmune diseases."
18022368,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Heat shock protein 60: evidence for receptor-mediated induction of proinflammatory mediators during adipocyte differentiation.,Adipocytes play important roles in lipid metabolism but also in the control of inflammatory processes. Based on our previous findings of heat shock protein (Hsp) 60-induced activation of preadipocytes we investigated whether the capacity of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) to interact with adipocytes and to stimulate their proinflammatory activity is determined by the differentiation state of the cells. Hsp60 bound to adipocytes and stimulated the release of inflammatory mediators independent of their differentiation state. Hsp60-adipocyte interactions revealed basic characteristics of a receptor-mediated process. Our findings characterize Hsp60 binding and Hsp60-induced release of proinflammatory mediators as fundamental properties of adipocytes independent of their differentiation state.
18022369,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Effects of ketamine on glucose uptake by glucose transporter type 3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes: The role of protein kinase C.,"We investigated the effects of ketamine on the type 3 facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT3), which plays a major role in glucose transport across the plasma membrane of neurons. Human-cloned GLUT3 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of GLUT3 mRNA. GLUT3-mediated glucose uptake was examined by measuring oocyte radioactivity following incubation with 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-(3)H]glucose. While ketamine and S(+)-ketamine significantly increased GLUT3-mediated glucose uptake, this effect was biphasic such that higher concentrations of ketamine inhibited glucose uptake. Ketamine (10microM) significantly increased V(max) but not K(m) of GLUT3 for 2-deoxy-d-glucose. Although staurosporine (a protein kinase C inhibitor) increased glucose uptake, no additive or synergistic interactions were observed between staurosporine and racemic ketamine or S(+)-ketamine. Treatment with ketamine or S(+)-ketamine partially prevented GLUT3 inhibition by the protein kinase C activator phorbol-12-myrisate-13-acetate. Our results indicate that ketamine increases GLUT3 activity at clinically relevant doses through a mechanism involving PKC inhibition."
18024585,1,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2010,The pharmacological NFkappaB inhibitors BAY117082 and MG132 induce cell arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells through ROS-mitochondria pathway activation.,"A growing body of evidence suggests the inhibition of NFkappaB as a strategy to induce cell death in tumor cells. In this work, we evaluated the effects of the pharmacological NFkappaB inhibitors BAY117082 and MG132 on leukemia cells apoptosis. BAY117082 and MG132 presented potent apoptotic effects compared to inhibitors of MAPKs, EGFR, PI3K/Akt, PKC and PKA signaling pathways. Non-tumor peripheral blood cells were insensitive to BAY117082 and MG132 apoptotic effects. BAY117082 and MG132-induced apoptosis was dependent on their ability to increase ROS as a prelude to mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release. Antioxidants blocked MG132 and BAY117082 effects on ROS, MMP and cell death. Although apoptotic markers as phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation and sub-G1 were detected in BAY117082-treated cells, caspases activation did not occur and apoptosis was insensitive to caspase inhibitors, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism. In contrast, MG132 induced classical apoptosis through ROS-mitochondria and subsequent caspase-9/caspase-3 activation. At sub-apoptotic concentrations, BAY117082 and MG132 arrested cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and blocked doxorubicin-induced NFkappaB, which sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells. Data suggest that the NFkappaB inhibitors MG132 and BAY117082 are potential anti-leukemia agents."
18024586,1,Virol. J.,101231645,2009,"A catalytically and genetically optimized beta-lactamase-matrix based assay for sensitive, specific, and higher throughput analysis of native henipavirus entry characteristics.","Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are the only paramyxoviruses requiring Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) containment. Thus, study of henipavirus entry at less than BSL-4 conditions necessitates the use of cell-cell fusion or pseudotyped reporter virus assays. Yet, these surrogate assays may not fully emulate the biological properties unique to the virus being studied. Thus, we developed a henipaviral entry assay based on a beta-lactamase-Nipah Matrix (betala-M) fusion protein. We first codon-optimized the bacterial betala and the NiV-M genes to ensure efficient expression in mammalian cells. The betala-M construct was able to bud and form virus-like particles (VLPs) that morphologically resembled paramyxoviruses. betala-M efficiently incorporated both NiV and HeV fusion and attachment glycoproteins. Entry of these VLPs was detected by cytosolic delivery of betala-M, resulting in enzymatic and fluorescent conversion of the pre-loaded CCF2-AM substrate. Soluble henipavirus receptors (ephrinB2) or antibodies against the F and/or G proteins blocked VLP entry. Additionally, a Y105W mutation engineered into the catalytic site of betala increased the sensitivity of our betala-M based infection assays by 2-fold. In toto, these methods will provide a more biologically relevant assay for studying henipavirus entry at less than BSL-4 conditions."
18024891,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Deviation of the neurosporaxanthin pathway towards beta-carotene biosynthesis in Fusarium fujikuroi by a point mutation in the phytoene desaturase gene.,"Carotenoids are widespread terpenoid pigments with applications in the food and feed industries. Upon illumination, the gibberellin-producing fungus Fusarium fujikuroi (Gibberella fujikuroi mating population C) develops an orange pigmentation caused by an accumulation of the carboxylic apocarotenoid neurosporaxanthin. The synthesis of this xanthophyll includes five desaturation steps presumed to be catalysed by the carB-encoded phytoene desaturase. In this study, we identified a yellow mutant (SF21) by mutagenesis of a carotenoid-overproducing strain. HPLC analyses indicated a specific impairment in the ability of SF21-CarB to perform the fifth desaturation, as implied by the accumulation of gamma-carotene and beta-carotene, which arise through four-step desaturation. Sequencing of the SF21 carB allele revealed a single mutation resulting in an exchange of a residue conserved in other five-step desaturases. Targeted carB allele replacement proved that this single mutation is the cause of the SF21 carotenoid pattern. In support, expression of SF21 CarB in engineered carotene-producing Escherichia coli strains demonstrated its reduced ability to catalyse the fifth desaturation step on both monocyclic and acyclic substrates. Further mutagenesis of SF21 led to the isolation of two mutants, SF73 and SF98, showing low desaturase activities, which mediated only two desaturation steps, resulting in accumulation of the intermediate zeta-carotene at low levels. Both strains contained an additional mutation affecting a CarB domain tentatively associated with carotenoid binding. SF21 exhibited higher carotenoid amounts than its precursor strain or the SF73 and SF98 mutants, although carotenogenic mRNA levels were similar in the four strains."
18025262,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Substrate binding mechanism of HIV-1 protease from explicit-solvent atomistic simulations.,"The binding mechanism of a peptide substrate (Thr-Ile-Met-Met-Gln-Arg, cleavage site p2-NC of the viral polyprotein) to wild-type HIV-1 protease has been investigated by 1.6 micros biased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. The configuration space has been explored biasing seven reaction coordinates by the bias-exchange metadynamics technique. The structure of the Michaelis complex is obtained starting from the substrate outside the enzyme within a backbone rmsd of 0.9 A. The calculated free energy of binding is -6 kcal/mol, and the kinetic constants for association and dissociation are 1.3 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and 57 s(-1), respectively, consistent with experiments. In the main binding pathway, the flaps of the protease do not open sizably. The substrate slides inside the enzyme cavity from the tight lateral channel. This may contrast with the natural polyprotein substrate which is expected to bind by opening the flaps. Thus, mutations might influence differently the binding kinetics of peptidomimetic ligands and of the natural substrate."

The location of nucleation was controlled by means of an optical mask; crystals were only observed in the area exposed to near-infrared laser radiation. The dependence of nucleation on laser power was measured, and the results suggest that the agarose gel reduces the effective supersaturation of the aqueous potassium chloride."
18025469,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Nitric oxide switches on the photoluminescence of molecularly engineered quantum dots.,The photoluminescence of nonfluorescent molecularly engineered quantum dots (QDs) with iron(III) dithiocarbamates was selectively switched on by nitric oxide. Such functional QDs consisted of CdSe-ZnS nanocrystals as fluorophores and surface bound tris(N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine)iron(III) as reactive centers for nitric oxide. The fluorescence of the QDs was quenched by energy transfer between the excited QD cores and the surface bound iron(III) dithiocarbamates due to their optical energy overlapping. Nitric oxide restored the fluorescence of the QDs through reduction of the surface bound iron(III) complexes to iron(I)-NO adducts and thus shutting down the energy transfer pathway. The fluorescence of the iron(III) complex engineered QDs was selectively and quantitatively restored by nitric oxide but not by other reactive oxygen species. Such a property of the functional QDs could be used for sensing nitric oxide based on the fluorescence &quot;turn on&quot; mechanism.
18032606,1,Cell Death Differ.,9437445,2009,The adenine nucleotide translocator 1 acts as a type 2 transglutaminase substrate: implications for mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.,"In this study we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) activity of type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) regulates the correct assembly and function of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP transporter adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1). We demonstrate, by means of biochemical and morphological analyses, that ANT1 and TG2 physically interact in the mitochondria. Under physiological conditions, TG2's PDI activity regulates the ADP/ATP transporter function by controlling the oligomerization of ANT1. In fact, mitochondria isolated from hearts of TG2(-/-) mice exhibit increased polymerization of ANT1, paralleled by an enhanced ADP/ATP carrier activity, as compared to mitochondria belonging to TG2(+/+) mice. Interestingly, upon cell-death induction, ANT1 becomes a substrate for TG2's cross-linking activity and the lack of TG2 results in a reduction of apoptosis as well as in a marked sensitivity to the ADP/ATP exchange inhibition by atractyloside. These findings suggest a complex TG2-dependent regulation of the ADP/ATP transporter and reveal new important avenues for its potential applications in the treatment of some mitochondrial-dependent diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases."
18032608,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,The SCAR and WASp nucleation-promoting factors act sequentially to mediate Drosophila myoblast fusion.,"The actin nucleation-promoting factors SCAR/WAVE and WASp, together with associated elements, mediate the formation of muscle fibres through myoblast fusion during Drosophila embryogenesis. Our phenotypic analysis, following the disruption of these two pathways, suggests that they function in a sequential manner. Suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor (SCAR) activity is required before the formation of pores in the membranes of fusing cells, whereas Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) promotes the expansion of nascent pores and completion of the fusion process. Genetic epistasis experiments are consistent with this step-wise temporal progression. Our observations further imply a separate, Rac-dependent role for the SCAR complex in promoting myoblast migration. In keeping with the sequential utilization of the two systems, we observe abnormal accumulations of filamentous actin at the fusion sites when both pathways are disrupted, resembling those present when only SCAR-complex function is impaired. This observation further suggests that actin-filament accumulation at the fusion sites might not depend on Arp2/3 activity altogether."
18034155,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,The structural basis of Arf effector specificity: the crystal structure of ARF6 in a complex with JIP4.,"The JNK-interacting proteins, JIP3 and JIP4, are specific effectors of the small GTP-binding protein ARF6. The interaction of ARF6-GTP with the second leucine zipper (LZII) domains of JIP3/JIP4 regulates the binding of JIPs to kinesin-1 and dynactin. Here, we report the crystal structure of ARF6-GTP bound to the JIP4-LZII at 1.9 A resolution. The complex is a heterotetramer with dyad symmetry arranged in an ARF6-(JIP4)(2)-ARF6 configuration. Comparison of the ARF6-JIP4 interface with the equivalent region of ARF1 shows the structural basis of JIP4's specificity for ARF6. Using site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance, we further show that non-conserved residues at the switch region borders are the key structural determinants of JIP4 specificity. A structure-derived model of the association of the ARF6-JIP3/JIP4 complex with membranes shows that the JIP4-LZII coiled-coil should lie along the membrane to prevent steric hindrances, resulting in only one ARF6 molecule bound. Such a heterotrimeric complex gives insights to better understand the ARF6-mediated motor switch regulatory function."
18034159,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Regulation of cross-linked actin network (CLAN) formation in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells by convergence of distinct beta1 and beta3 integrin pathways.,"PURPOSE: To determine the beta1/beta3 integrin-mediated pathways that regulate cross-linked actin network (CLAN) formation in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. CLANs form in glaucomatous and steroid-treated TM cells, which may contribute to reducing outflow facility through the TM. METHODS: Expression of CD47 (an alphavbeta3 integrin coreceptor/thrombospondin-1 receptor) and integrins alphavbeta3 and beta1 was assessed by FACS. CLANs were induced by plating cells on fibronectin (a beta1 integrin ligand) in the absence or presence of the beta3 integrin-activating mAb AP-5 and were identified by phalloidin labeling. The role of Src kinases, PI-3 kinase (PI-3K), Rac1, and CD47 was determined by incubating cells with the inhibitors PP2 and EPA (Src kinases), LY294002 (PI-3K), or NSC23766 (Rac1). Tiam1 and Trio siRNAs and dominant-negative Tiam1 were used to determine which Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor was involved. The role of CD47 was determined using the thrombospondin-1-derived agonist peptide 4N1K and the CD47 function blocking antibody B6H12.2. RESULTS: HTM cells expressed CD47 and integrins alphavbeta3 and beta1. beta3 Integrin or CD47 activation significantly increased CLAN formation over beta1 integrin-induced levels, whereas anti-CD47 mAb B6H12.2 inhibited this increase. PP2, NSC23766, and Trio siRNA decreased beta3-induced CLAN formation by 72%, 45%, and 67%, respectively, whereas LY294002 and dominant negative Tiam1 had no effect. LY294002 decreased beta1 integrin-mediated CLAN formation by 42%, and PP2 completely blocked it. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct beta1 and alphavbeta3 integrin signaling pathways converge to enhance CLAN formation. beta1-Mediated CLAN formation was PI-3K dependent, whereas beta3-mediated CLAN formation was CD47 and Rac1/Trio dependent and might have been regulated by thrombospondin-1. Both integrin pathways were Src dependent."

METHODS: Human corneal epithelial (HCE) and human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells were cultivated on human amniotic membrane (AM) to confluence and then air lifted to allow further stratification and differentiation. Denuded AM and cultivated HCE and cultivated HCjE cells were then transplanted into 18 eyes of rabbits with induced LSCD. The cultivated and engrafted epithelia were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry. Two weeks after transplantation, the eyes were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and scored on epithelial integrity, corneal haze, and corneal neovascularization. RESULTS: Both cultivated and engrafted HCjE sheets demonstrated confluent epithelial sheets with five to six layers of well-stratified epithelium. TEM examination of engrafted HCjE revealed numerous microvilli, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes, identical with in vivo corneal epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of both HCjE and HCE cells showed the presence of CK3, CK4, and CK12, with absence of Muc5AC. Clinical outcomes for eyes receiving HCjE transplants and HCE transplants were comparable, with most having transparent, smooth corneas, free of epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that microscopically, HCjE cells have features similar to HCE cells, with clinically equivalent outcomes. The ex vivo cultivation of conjunctiva to form transplantable epithelial sheets for corneal replacement is a promising new treatment modality in patients with LSCD."
18034162,1,Virol. J.,101231645,2009,Sequence diversity on four ORFs of citrus tristeza virus correlates with pathogenicity.,"The molecular characterization of isolates of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) from eight locations in Mexico was undertaken by analyzing five regions located at the opposite ends of the virus genome. Two regions have been previously used to study CTV variability (coat protein and p23), while the other three correspond to other genomic segments (p349-B, p349-C and p13). Our comparative nucleotide analyses included CTV sequences from different geographical origins already deposited in the GenBank databases. The largest nucleotide differences were located in two fragments located at the 5' end of the genome (p349-B and p349-C). Phylogenetic analyses on those five regions showed that the degree of nucleotide divergence among strains tended to correlate with their pathogenicity. Two main groups were defined: mild, with almost no noticeable effects on the indicator plants and severe, with drastic symptoms. Mild isolates clustered together in every analyzed ORF sharing a genetic distance below 0.022, in contrast with the severe isolates, which showed a more disperse distribution and a genetic distance of 0.276. Analyses of the p349-B and p349-C regions evidenced two lineages within the severe group: severe common subgroup (most of severe isolates) and severe divergent subgroup (T36-like isolates). This study represents the first attempt to analyze the genetic variability of CTV in Mexico by constructing phylogenetic trees based on new genomic regions that use group-specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences. These results may be useful to implement specific assays for strain discrimination. Moreover, it would be an excellent reference for the CTV situation in México to face the recent arrival of brown citrus aphid."

Soc.,7503056,2009,The use of differential receptors to pattern peptide phosphorylation.,"An array sensing scheme for the differentiation of small peptides and their phosphorylated analogues is introduced. The technique involves a series of receptors created by appending random peptides to a C(3v) symmetric scaffold that binds phosphomonoesters. Five specific peptide sequences were selected through a screening technique. In addition to cross reactivity being created by the peptides in the receptors, three metal ions and three pH indicators are used to create a suite of 45 indicator displacement assays. The colorimetric data from the 45 sensing ensembles is collected in a 96-well plate reader, and linear discriminant analysis gives patterns resulting in 100% classification of the peptides. The approach demonstrates a generalizable principle to create pattern-based recognition protocols for complex analytes."
18040044,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Internal return of carbon dioxide in decarboxylation: catalysis of separation and 12C/13C kinetic isotope effects.,"It has been proposed that the decarboxylation of mandelylthiamin, the adduct of benzoylformate and thiamin, is uniquely catalyzed by protonated pyridines through a preassociation mechanism in which proton transfer competes with the internal return of carbon dioxide. Application of this mechanism suggests that the observed primary (12)C/(13)C kinetic isotope effect in the absence of catalyst is reduced in magnitude because diffusion of carbon dioxide is partially rate-determining. Where proton transfer blocks the internal return of carbon dioxide, the separation of carbon dioxide is facilitated, and the observed isotope effect increases toward the intrinsic value for carbon-carbon bond breaking. Headspace analysis of carbon dioxide formed over the course of the reaction shows that protonated pyridine increases the magnitude of the observed (12)C/(13)C KIE, consistent with the proposed mechanism."
18042718,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Interaction of human DNA polymerase alpha and DNA polymerase I from Bacillus stearothermophilus with hypoxanthine and 8-oxoguanine nucleotides.,"To better understand how DNA polymerases interact with mutagenic bases, we examined how human DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha), a B family enzyme, and DNA polymerase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (BF), an A family enzyme, generate adenine:hypoxanthine and adenine:8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) base pairs. Pol alpha strongly discriminated against polymerizing dATP opposite 8-oxoG, and removing N1, N(6), or N7 further inhibited incorporation, whereas removing N3 from dATP dramatically increased incorporation (32-fold). Eliminating N(6) from 3-deaza-dATP now greatly reduced incorporation, suggesting that incorporation of dATP (analogues) opposite 8-oxoguanine proceeds via a Hoogsteen base pair and that pol alpha uses N3 of a purine dNTP to block this incorporation. Pol alpha also polymerized 8-oxo-dGTP across from a templating A, and removing N(6) from the template adenine inhibited incorporation of 8-oxoG. The effects of N1, N(6), and N7 demonstrated a strong interdependence during formation of adenine:hypoxanthine base pairs by pol alpha, and N3 of dATP again helps prevent polymerization opposite a templating hypoxanthine. BF very efficiently polymerized 8-oxo-dGTP opposite adenine, and N1 and N7 of adenine appear to play important roles. BF incorporates dATP opposite 8-oxoG less efficiently, and modifying N1, N(6), or N7 greatly inhibits incorporation. N(6) and, to a lesser extent, N1 help drive hypoxanthine:adenine base-pair formation by BF. The mechanistic implications of these results showing that different polymerases interact very differently with base lesions are discussed."
18042720,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Local network topology in human protein interaction data predicts functional association.,"The use of high-throughput techniques to generate large volumes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has increased the need for methods that systematically and automatically suggest functional relationships among proteins. In a yeast PPI network, previous work has shown that the local connection topology, particularly for two proteins sharing an unusually large number of neighbors, can predict functional association. In this study we improved the prediction scheme by developing a new algorithm and applied it on a human PPI network to make a genome-wide functional inference. We used the new algorithm to measure and reduce the influence of hub proteins on detecting function-associated protein pairs. We used the annotations of the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as benchmarks to compare and evaluate the function relevance. The application of our algorithms to human PPI data yielded 4,233 significant functional associations among 1,754 proteins. Further functional comparisons between them allowed us to assign 466 KEGG pathway annotations to 274 proteins and 123 GO annotations to 114 proteins with estimated false discovery rates of &lt;21% for KEGG and &lt;30% for GO. We clustered 1,729 proteins by their functional associations and made functional inferences from detailed analysis on one subcluster highly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway (P&lt;10(-50)). Analysis of another four subclusters also suggested potential new players in six signaling pathways worthy of further experimental investigations. Our study gives clear insight into the common neighbor-based prediction scheme and provides a reliable method for large-scale functional annotation in this post-genomic era."
18042724,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Long-range correlations in rectal temperature fluctuations of healthy infants during maturation.,"BACKGROUND: Control of breathing, heart rate, and body temperature are interdependent in infants, where instabilities in thermoregulation can contribute to apneas or even life-threatening events. Identifying abnormalities in thermoregulation is particularly important in the first 6 months of life, where autonomic regulation undergoes critical development. Fluctuations in body temperature have been shown to be sensitive to maturational stage as well as system failure in critically ill patients. We thus aimed to investigate the existence of fractal-like long-range correlations, indicative of temperature control, in night time rectal temperature (T(rec)) patterns in maturing infants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured T(rec) fluctuations in infants every 4 weeks from 4 to 20 weeks of age and before and after immunization. Long-range correlations in the temperature series were quantified by the correlation exponent, alpha using detrended fluctuation analysis. The effects of maturation, room temperature, and immunization on the strength of correlation were investigated. We found that T(rec) fluctuations exhibit fractal long-range correlations with a mean (SD) alpha of 1.51 (0.11), indicating that T(rec) is regulated in a highly correlated and hence deterministic manner. A significant increase in alpha with age from 1.42 (0.07) at 4 weeks to 1.58 (0.04) at 20 weeks reflects a change in long-range correlation behavior with maturation towards a smoother and more deterministic temperature regulation, potentially due to the decrease in surface area to body weight ratio in the maturing infant. alpha was not associated with mean room temperature or influenced by immunization CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the quantification of long-range correlations using alpha derived from detrended fluctuation analysis is an observer-independent tool which can distinguish developmental stages of night time T(rec) pattern in young infants, reflective of maturation of the autonomic system. Detrended fluctuation analysis may prove useful for characterizing thermoregulation in premature and other infants at risk for life-threatening events."
18042729,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"Systematic analysis of immune infiltrates in high-grade serous ovarian cancer reveals CD20, FoxP3 and TIA-1 as positive prognostic factors.","BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating T cells are associated with survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but their functional status is poorly understood, especially relative to the different risk categories and histological subtypes of EOC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Tissue microarrays containing high-grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically for the presence of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, macrophages, MHC class I and II, and various markers of activation and inflammation. In high-grade serous tumors from optimally debulked patients, positive associations were seen between intraepithelial cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD25, TIA-1, Granzyme B, FoxP3, CD20, and CD68, as well as expression of MHC class I and II by tumor cells. Disease-specific survival was positively associated with the markers CD8, CD3, FoxP3, TIA-1, CD20, MHC class I and class II. In other histological subtypes, immune infiltrates were less prevalent, and the only markers associated with survival were MHC class II (positive association in endometrioid cases) and myeloperoxidase (negative association in clear cell cases). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Host immune responses to EOC vary widely according to histological subtype and the extent of residual disease. TIA-1, FoxP3 and CD20 emerge as new positive prognostic factors in high-grade serous EOC from optimally debulked patients."
18044991,1,Nature,410462,2009,Presenilins are essential for regulating neurotransmitter release.,"Mutations in the presenilin genes are the main cause of familial Alzheimer's disease. Loss of presenilin activity and/or accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides have been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by impairing synaptic function. However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we use a genetic approach to inactivate presenilins conditionally in either presynaptic (CA3) or postsynaptic (CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway. We show that long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst stimulation is decreased after presynaptic but not postsynaptic deletion of presenilins. Moreover, we found that presynaptic but not postsynaptic inactivation of presenilins alters short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The probability of evoked glutamate release, measured with the open-channel NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist MK-801, is reduced by presynaptic inactivation of presenilins. Notably, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores by thapsigargin, or blockade of Ca(2+) release from these stores by ryanodine receptor inhibitors, mimics and occludes the effects of presynaptic presenilin inactivation. Collectively, these results indicate a selective role for presenilins in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction by modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) release in presynaptic terminals, and further suggest that presynaptic dysfunction might be an early pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease."

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous alemtuzumab at low dose (10 mg three times per week, for 18 weeks) to 49 patients with pre-treated CLL. The overall response rate was 53%, including 27% of complete responses; it was 42% in patients over 70 years, and 54% in the fludarabine-resistant patients. Forty-five percent of the patients with an unfavourable karyotype responded, including 60% of those with the 17p- aberration. After a median follow-up of 25 months, the median overall time to disease progression was 8 months (responders 12 months, non-responders 4 months). The median overall time to alternative treatment was 9 months (responders 17 months, non-responders 6 months) and median overall survival was 30 months. The treatment was well tolerated: grade IV neutropenia was observed in 17%, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 24% of the patients, with no CMV disease. We observed a total of 30 infections (50% during treatment and 50% during the 12-month follow-up), only one-third of which was severe. This study confirms that low-dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab is effective in poor prognosis CLL, and has a particularly favourable toxicity profile."
18045539,1,Nature,410462,2009,Specific pathways prevent duplication-mediated genome rearrangements.,"We have investigated the ability of different regions of the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V to participate in the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). We found that the 4.2-kilobase HXT13-DSF1 region sharing divergent homology with chromosomes IV, X and XIV, similar to mammalian segmental duplications, was 'at risk' for participating in duplication-mediated GCRs generated by homologous recombination. Numerous genes and pathways, including SGS1, TOP3, RMI1, SRS2, RAD6, SLX1, SLX4, SLX5, MSH2, MSH6, RAD10 and the DNA replication stress checkpoint requiring MRC1 and TOF1, were highly specific for suppressing these GCRs compared to GCRs mediated by single-copy sequences. These results indicate that the mechanisms for formation and suppression of rearrangements occurring in regions containing at-risk sequences differ from those occurring in regions of single-copy sequence. This explains how extensive genome instability is prevented in eukaryotic cells whose genomes contain numerous divergent repeated sequences."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Molecular mechanisms of lipoic acid modulation of T-type calcium channels in pain pathway.,"Alpha-lipoic acid (1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid; lipoic acid) is an endogenous compound used to treat pain disorders in humans, but its mechanisms of analgesic action are not well understood. Here, we show that lipoic acid selectively inhibited native Ca(V)3.2 T-type calcium currents (T-currents) and diminished T-channel-dependent cellular excitability in acutely isolated rat sensory neurons. Lipoic acid locally injected into peripheral receptive fields of pain-sensing sensory neurons (nociceptors) in vivo decreased sensitivity to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli in wild-type but not Ca(V)3.2 knock-out mice. Ensuing molecular studies demonstrated that lipoic acid inhibited recombinant Ca(V)3.2 channels heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by oxidating specific thiol residues on the cytoplasmic face of the channel. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of a nociceptive ion channel modulation that may contribute to the documented analgesic properties of lipoic acid in vivo."
18046458,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Interactions between auxin and strigolactone in shoot branching control.,"In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases MORE AXILLARY GROWTH3 (MAX3) and MAX4 act together with MAX1 to produce a strigolactone signaling molecule required for the inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. We show that both MAX3 and MAX4 transcripts are positively auxin regulated in a manner similar to the orthologous genes from pea (Pisum sativum) and rice (Oryza sativa), supporting evolutionary conservation of this regulation in plants. This regulation is important for branching control because large auxin-related reductions in these transcripts are associated with increased axillary branching. Both transcripts are up-regulated in max mutants, and consistent with max mutants having increased auxin in the polar auxin transport stream, this feedback regulation involves auxin signaling. We suggest that both auxin and strigolactone have the capacity to modulate each other's levels and distribution in a dynamic feedback loop required for the coordinated control of axillary branching."
18046459,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,"Complexation and toxicity of copper in higher plants. I. Characterization of copper accumulation, speciation, and toxicity in Crassula helmsii as a new copper accumulator.","The amphibious water plant Crassula helmsii is an invasive copper (Cu)-tolerant neophyte in Europe. It now turned out to accumulate Cu up to more than 9,000 ppm in its shoots at 10 microm (=0.6 ppm) Cu(2+) in the nutrient solution, indicating that it is a Cu hyperaccumulator. We investigated uptake, binding environment, and toxicity of Cu in this plant under emerged and submerged conditions. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements on frozen-hydrated samples revealed that Cu was bound almost exclusively by oxygen ligands, likely organic acids, and not any sulfur ligands. Despite significant differences in photosynthesis biochemistry and biophysics between emerged and submerged plants, no differences in Cu ligands were found. While measurements of tissue pH confirmed the diurnal acid cycle typical for Crassulacean acid metabolism, Delta(13)C measurements showed values typical for regular C3 photosynthesis. Cu-induced inhibition of photosynthesis mainly affected the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, but with some unusual features. Most obviously, the degree of light saturation of electron transport increased during Cu stress, while maximal dark-adapted PSII quantum yield did not change and light-adapted quantum yield of PSII photochemistry decreased particularly in the first 50 s after onset of actinic irradiance. This combination of changes, which were strongest in submerged cultures, shows a decreasing number of functional reaction centers relative to the antenna in a system with high antenna connectivity. Nonphotochemical quenching, in contrast, was modified by Cu mainly in emerged cultures. Pigment concentrations in stressed plants strongly decreased, but no changes in their ratios occurred, indicating that cells either survived intact or died and bleached quickly."
18046461,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Characterization of new maize genes putatively involved in cytokinin metabolism and their expression during osmotic stress in relation to cytokinin levels.,"Plant hormones, cytokinins (CKs), have been for a long time considered to be involved in plant responses to stress. However, their exact roles in processes linked to stress signalization and acclimatization to adverse environmental conditions are unknown. In this study, expression profiles of the entire gene families of CK biosynthetic and degradation genes in maize (Zea mays) during development and stress responses are described. Transcript abundance of particular genes is discussed in relation to the levels of different CK metabolites. Salt and osmotic stresses induce expression of some CK biosynthetic genes in seedlings of maize, leading to a moderate increase of active forms of CKs lasting several days during acclimatization to stress. A direct effect of CKs to mediate activation of stress responses does not seem to be possible due to the slow changes in metabolite levels. However, expression of genes involved in cytokinin signal transduction is uniformly down-regulated within 0.5 h of stress induction by an unknown mechanism. cis-Zeatin and its derivatives were found to be the most abundant CKs in young maize seedlings. We demonstrate that levels of this zeatin isomer are significantly enhanced during early stress response and that it originates independently from de novo biosynthesis in stressed tissues, possibly by elevated specific RNA degradation. By enhancing their CK levels, plants could perhaps undergo a reduction of growth rates maintained by abscisic acid accumulation in stressed tissues. A second role for cytokinin receptors in sensing turgor response is hypothesized besides their documented function in CK signaling."

The aim of this study was to improve immunogenicity of L2 peptides by surface display on highly ordered, self-assembled virus-like particles (VLP) of major capsid protein L1, and to more completely characterize neutralization epitopes of L2. Overlapping peptides comprising amino acids (aa) 2 to 22 (hereafter, chimera or peptide 2-22), 13 to 107, 18 to 31, 17 to 36, 35 to 75, 75 to 112, 115 to 154, 149 to 175, and 172 to 200 of HPV type 16 (HPV16) L2 were genetically engineered into the DE surface loop of bovine papillomavirus type 1 L1 VLP. Except for chimeras 35-75 and 13-107, recombinant fusion proteins assembled into VLP. Vaccination of rabbits with Freund's adjuvanted native VLP induced higher L2-specific antibody titers than vaccination with corresponding sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured proteins. Immune sera to epitopes within residues 13 to 154 neutralized HPV16 in pseudovirion neutralization assays, whereas chimera 17-36 induced additional cross-neutralization to divergent high-risk HPV18, -31, -45, -52, and -58; low-risk HPV11; and beta-type HPV5 (titers of 50 to 10,000). Aluminum hydroxide-monophosphoryl lipid A (Alum-MPL)-adjuvanted VLP induced similar patterns of neutralization in both rabbits and mice, albeit with 100-fold-lower titers than Freund's adjuvant. Importantly, Alum-MPL-adjuvanted immunization with chimeric HPV16L1-HPV16L2 (peptide 17-36) VLP induced neutralization or cross-neutralization of HPV16, -18, -31, -45, -52, and -58; HPV6 and -11; and HPV5 (titers of 50 to 100,000). Immunization with HPV16 L1-HPV16 L2 (chimera 17-36) VLP in adjuvant applicable for human use induces broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against HPV types evolutionarily divergent to HPV16 and thus may protect against infection with mucosal high-risk, low-risk, and beta HPV types and associated disease."
18048335,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Fragile X mental retardation protein regulates the levels of scaffold proteins and glutamate receptors in postsynaptic densities.,"Functional absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes the fragile X syndrome, a hereditary form of mental retardation characterized by a change in dendritic spine morphology. The RNA-binding protein FMRP has been implicated in regulating postsynaptic protein synthesis. Here we have analyzed whether the abundance of scaffold proteins and neurotransmitter receptor subunits in postsynaptic densities (PSDs) is altered in the neocortex and hippocampus of FMRP-deficient mice. Whereas the levels of several PSD components are unchanged, concentrations of Shank1 and SAPAP scaffold proteins and various glutamate receptor subunits are altered in both adult and juvenile knock-out mice. With the exception of slightly increased hippocampal SAPAP2 mRNA levels in adult animals, altered postsynaptic protein concentrations do not correlate with similar changes in total and synaptic levels of corresponding mRNAs. Thus, loss of FMRP in neurons appears to mainly affect the translation and not the abundance of particular brain transcripts. Semi-quantitative analysis of RNA levels in FMRP immunoprecipitates showed that in the mouse brain mRNAs encoding PSD components, such as Shank1, SAPAP1-3, PSD-95, and the glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B, are associated with FMRP. Luciferase reporter assays performed in primary cortical neurons from knock-out and wild-type mice indicate that FMRP silences translation of Shank1 mRNAs via their 3'-untranslated region. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors relieves translational suppression. As Shank1 controls dendritic spine morphology, our data suggest that dysregulation of Shank1 synthesis may significantly contribute to the abnormal spine development and function observed in brains of fragile X syndrome patients."
18049475,1,Virology,110674,2009,Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) activates the ORF50 lytic switch promoter: a potential positive feedback loop for sustained ORF50 gene expression.,"KSHV vGPCR, a lytic cycle associated protein, induces several signaling pathways leading to the activation of various transcription factors and consequently the expression of cellular and viral genes. Though the role of vGPCR in KSHV tumorigenicity has been well studied, its function related to the viral life cycle is poorly understood. Reduction in vGPCR by RNA interference also resulted in the reduction in KSHV lytic switch ORF50 gene and protein expression. Induction of vGPCR by doxycycline in BC3.14 cells also resulted in more KSHV production. When this was explored, induction of the ORF50 promoter by vGPCR expression was observed. Further examination of the molecular mechanisms by which vGPCR regulates the ORF50 promoter, using various ORF50 promoter constructs, revealed that induction of ORF50 promoter by vGPCR did not involve AP1 but was dependent on Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. vGPCR signaling led to an increase in Sp1 and Sp3 DNA binding activity and a decrease in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. These activities were pertussis toxin independent, did not involve Rho and Rac-GTPases and involved the heterotrimeric G protein subunits Galpha12 and Galphaq. Studies using pharmacologic inhibitors and dominant-negative proteins identified phospholipase C, the novel protein kinase C (novel PKC) family and protein kinase D (PKD) as part of the signaling initiated by vGPCR leading to ORF50 promoter activation. Taken together, this study suggests a role for vGPCR in the sustained expression of ORF50 which could lead to a continued activation of lytic cycle genes and ultimately to successful viral progeny formation."
18052611,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Fish consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer: the Ohsaki Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that high fish consumption may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but the results of studies in humans have been inconsistent. The objective of this study was to prospectively examine the association between fish consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer incidence in Japan, where fish is widely consumed. METHODS: We analysed data from 39 498 men and women registered in the Ohsaki National Health Insurance Cohort Study who were 40-79 years old and free of cancer at the baseline. Fish consumption was assessed at the baseline using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: During 9 years of follow-up, we identified 566 incident cases of colorectal cancer (379 men and 187 women). The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal cancer incidence in the highest quartile of fish consumption compared with the lowest quartile were 1.07 (95% CIs; 0.78-1.46, P-trend=0.43) for men, and 0.96 (95% CIs; 0.61-1.53, P-trend=0.69) for women. CONCLUSION: The results of this prospective cohort study revealed no association between fish consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer."

Biol.,101235389,2009,"Pathway databases and tools for their exploitation: benefits, current limitations and challenges.","In past years, comprehensive representations of cell signalling pathways have been developed by manual curation from literature, which requires huge effort and would benefit from information stored in databases and from automatic retrieval and integration methods. Once a reconstruction of the network of interactions is achieved, analysis of its structural features and its dynamic behaviour can take place. Mathematical modelling techniques are used to simulate the complex behaviour of cell signalling networks, which ultimately sheds light on the mechanisms leading to complex diseases or helps in the identification of drug targets. A variety of databases containing information on cell signalling pathways have been developed in conjunction with methodologies to access and analyse the data. In principle, the scenario is prepared to make the most of this information for the analysis of the dynamics of signalling pathways. However, are the knowledge repositories of signalling pathways ready to realize the systems biology promise? In this article we aim to initiate this discussion and to provide some insights on this issue."
18055606,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Nucleophosmin redistribution following heat shock: a role in heat-induced radiosensitization.,"Cellular survival from radiation-induced DNA damage requires access to sites of damage for the assembly of repair complexes and the subsequent repair, particularly the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Hyperthermia causes changes in protein-protein/DNA interactions in the nucleus that block access to sites of DNA damage. Studies presented here indicate that the nucleolar protein, nucleophosmin (NPM), redistributes from the nucleolus following hyperthermia, increases its association with DNA, and blocks access to DNA DSBs. Reduction of NPM significantly reduces heat-induced radiosensitization, but reduced NPM level does not alter radiation sensitivity per se. NPM knockdown reduces heat-induced inhibition of DNA DSB repair. Also, these results suggest that NPM associates with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA in heat-shocked cells."
18056116,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates cytokinesis through Cep55.,"Failure of cytokinesis results in tetraploidy and can increase the genomic instability frequently observed in cancer. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, which is deregulated in many tumors, regulates several processes, including cell cycle progression. Here, we show a novel role for Pin1 in cytokinesis. Pin1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a cytokinesis delay, and depletion of Pin1 from HeLa cells also causes a cytokinesis defect. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Pin1 localizes to the midbody ring and regulates the final stages of cytokinesis by binding to centrosome protein 55 kDa (Cep55), an essential component of this ring. This interaction induces Polo-like kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of Cep55, which is critical for the function of Cep55 during cytokinesis. Importantly, Pin1 knockdown does not enhance the cytokinesis defect in Cep55-depleted cells, indicating that Pin1 and Cep55 act in the same pathway. These data are the first evidence that Pin1 regulates cytokinesis and may provide a mechanistic explanation as to how pathologic levels of Pin1 can stimulate tumorigenesis."
18056643,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Specific targeting of brain tumors with an optical/magnetic resonance imaging nanoprobe across the blood-brain barrier.,"Nanoparticle-based platforms have drawn considerable attention for their potential effect on oncology and other biomedical fields. However, their in vivo application is challenged by insufficient accumulation and retention within tumors due to limited specificity to the target, and an inability to traverse biological barriers. Here, we present a nanoprobe that shows an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and specifically target brain tumors in a genetically engineered mouse model, as established through in vivo magnetic resonance and biophotonic imaging, and histologic and biodistribution analyses. The nanoprobe is comprised of an iron oxide nanoparticle coated with biocompatible polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan copolymer, to which a tumor-targeting agent, chlorotoxin, and a near-IR fluorophore are conjugated. The nanoprobe shows an innocuous toxicity profile and sustained retention in tumors. With the versatile affinity of the targeting ligand and the flexible conjugation chemistry for alternative diagnostic and therapeutic agents, this nanoparticle platform can be potentially used for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of tumor types."
18056647,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,"Phosphorylation of CLASP2 by GSK-3beta regulates its interaction with IQGAP1, EB1 and microtubules.","Polarised cell migration is required for various cell behaviours and functions. Actin and microtubules are coupled structurally and distributed asymmetrically along the front-rear axis of migrating cells. CLIP-associating proteins (CLASPs) accumulate near the ends of microtubules at the front of migrating cells to control microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal coupling. Regional inhibition of GSK-3beta is responsible for this asymmetric distribution of CLASPs. However, it is not known how GSK-3beta regulates the activity of CLASPs for linkage between actin and microtubules. Here we identified IQGAP1, an actin-binding protein, as a novel CLASP-binding protein. GSK-3beta directly phosphorylates CLASP2 at Ser533 and Ser537 within the region responsible for the IQGAP1 binding. Phosphorylation of CLASP2 results in the dissociation of CLASP2 from IQGAP1, EB1 and microtubules. At the leading edges of migrating fibroblasts, CLASP2 near microtubule ends partially colocalises with IQGAP1. Expression of active GSK-3beta abrogates the distribution of CLASP2 on microtubules, but not that of a nonphosphorylatable CLASP2 mutant. The phosphorylated CLASP2 does not accumulate near the ends of microtubules at the leading edges. Thus, phosphorylation of CLASP2 by GSK-3beta appears to control the regional linkage of microtubules to actin filaments through IQGAP1 for cell migration."

Sci.,52457,2009,KDP-1 is a nuclear envelope KASH protein required for cell-cycle progression.,"Klarsicht, ANC-1 and Syne homology (KASH) proteins localize to the outer nuclear membrane where they connect the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. KASH proteins interact with Sad1-UNC-84 (SUN) proteins to transfer forces across the nuclear envelope to position nuclei or move chromosomes. A new KASH protein, KDP-1, was identified in a membrane yeast two-hybrid screen of a Caenorhabditis elegans library using the SUN protein UNC-84 as bait. KDP-1 also interacted with SUN-1. KDP-1 was enriched at the nuclear envelope in a variety of tissues and required SUN-1 for nuclear envelope localization in the germline. Genetic analyses showed that kdp-1 was essential for embryonic viability, larval growth and germline development. kdp-1(RNAi) delayed the entry into mitosis in embryos, led to a small mitotic zone in the germline, and caused an endomitotic phenotype. Aspects of these phenotypes were similar to those seen in sun-1(RNAi), suggesting that KDP-1 functions with SUN-1 in the germline and early embryo. The data suggest that KDP-1 is a novel KASH protein that functions to ensure the timely progression of the cell cycle between the end of S phase and the entry into mitosis."
18056806,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,JNK1-dependent PUMA expression contributes to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis.,"Free fatty acids (FFA) induce hepatocyte lipoapoptosis by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent mechanism. However, the cellular processes by which JNK engages the core apoptotic machinery during lipotoxicity, especially activation of BH3-only proteins, remain incompletely understood. Thus, our aim was to determine whether JNK mediates induction of BH3-only proteins during hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. The saturated FFA palmitate, but not the monounsaturated FFA oleate, induces an increase in PUMA mRNA and protein levels. Palmitate induction of PUMA was JNK1-dependent in primary murine hepatocytes. Palmitate-mediated PUMA expression was inhibited by a dominant negative c-Jun, and direct binding of a phosphorylated c-Jun containing the activator protein 1 complex to the PUMA promoter was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Short hairpin RNA-targeted knockdown of PUMA attenuated Bax activation, caspase 3/7 activity, and cell death. Similarly, the genetic deficiency of Puma rendered murine hepatocytes resistant to lipoapoptosis. PUMA expression was also increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis as compared with patients with simple steatosis or controls. Collectively, the data implicate JNK1-dependent PUMA expression as a mechanism contributing to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis."
18056989,1,BMC Genet.,100966978,2009,QTL analyses of temporal and intensity components of home-cage activity in KJR and C57BL/6J strains.,"BACKGROUND: A variety of mouse strains exhibit diversity in spontaneous activity consistent with an important genetic contribution. To date, many studies have defined spontaneous home-cage activity as total distance or total counts of activity within a test period. However, spontaneous activity is, in fact, a composite of elements of 'temporal' and 'intensity' that is similar to 'velocity'. Here, we report on quantitative trait loci for different components of spontaneous activity, an important step towards dissection of the underlying genetic mechanisms. RESULTS: In the analysis of total home-cage activity (THA) after habituation in female mice, KJR strain exhibit higher activity than C57BL/6J (B6). In this study, THA was partitioned into two components: active time (AT) was an index of the 'temporal element' of THA, average activity during active time (AA) was an index of 'intensity'. Correlation analysis using B6xKJR F2 female mice indicated that AA is a major component of THA, whereas AA and AT were associated to a lesser degree. To explore the genetic basis of the activity differences, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis on data of THA and its components, AT and AA. Three significant QTL affecting variation of different components of home cage activity were identified, two linked QTL Hylaq1 and Hylaq2 on Chr 2, and Hylaq3 on Chr 10. Chromosomal positions of these QTL were previously implicated in locomotor activity (Chr 2) or open-field ambulation (Chr 10). The results indicated that Hylaq1 influences AT, Hylaq2, AA, while Hylaq3 is associated with both AA and AT. CONCLUSION: Through this study, we found that variation in total home cage activity over a 3 day period is affected by variation in active time and intensity of activity. The latter two variables are distinct components of home cage activity with only partially overlapping genetic architecture."

We have studied the interactions between the two chromophores by monitoring the absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies of artificial pigments derived from synthetic retinal analogues characterized by shifted absorption maxima. In addition, we have followed the binding process of the synthetic chromophores to the apomembrane of xR. We have revealed that the CD spectrum of xR originated mainly from the carotenoid chromophore without a significant contribution of the retinal chromophore. Because the binding process rate of these analogues is slower compared to all-trans retinal, it was possible to detect and analyze the major alterations in the CD spectrum. It was revealed that the main changes occur as a result of binding site occupation by the retinal chromophore and not because of the formation of the retinal-protein covalent bond."
18059477,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Combining molecular dynamics with bayesian analysis to predict and evaluate ligand-binding mutations in influenza hemagglutinin.,"Influenza virus attaches to and infects target cells via binding of cell-surface glycans by the viral hemagglutinin. This binding specificity is considered a major reason why avian influenza is typically poorly transmitted between humans, while swine influenza is better transmitted due to glycan similarity between the human and swine upper respiratory tract. Predicting mutations that control glycan binding is thus important to continued surveillance against new pandemic influenza strains. We have designed a molecular-dynamics approach for scoring potential mutants with predictive power for both receptor-binding-domain and allosteric mutations similar to those identified from clinical isolates of avian influenza. We have performed thousands of simulations of 17 different hemagglutinin mutants totaling &gt;1 ms in length and employ a bayesian model to rank mutations that disrupt the stability of the hemagglutinin-ligand complex. Based on our simulations, we predict a significantly increased k(off) for seven of these mutants. This means of using molecular dynamics analysis to make experimentally verifiable predictions offers a potentially general method to identify ligand-binding mutants, particularly allosteric ones. Our analysis of ligand dissociation provides a means to evaluate mutants prior to experimental mutagenesis and testing and constitutes an important step toward understanding the determinants of ligand binding by H5N1 influenza."

Therefore, it can be hypothesised that sequence variation in the mitochondrial genome is a contributing factor to the etiology of diseases related to these different cellular events, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to assess the frequency of haplogroups and polymorphisms in the control region (CR) of mitochondrial DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with prostate carcinoma (n = 304) versus patients screened for prostate disease but found to be negative for cancer on biopsy (n = 278) in a Middle European population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The nine major European haplogroups and the CR polymorphisms were identified by means of primer extension analysis and DNA sequencing, respectively. We found that mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies and CR polymorphisms do not differ significantly between patients with or without prostate cancer, implying no impact of inherited mitochondrial DNA variation on predisposition to prostate carcinoma in a Middle European population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results contrast with a recent report claiming an association between mtDNA haplogroup U and prostate cancer in a North American population of caucasian descent."
18065690,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Distinct responses of human monocyte subsets to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an environmental fungus that causes life-threatening infections in neutropenic patients. In the absence of intact innate immunity, inhaled A. fumigatus spores (conidia) germinate in the lung, forming hyphae that invade blood vessels and disseminate to other tissues. Although macrophages and neutrophils are postulated to provide defense against invasive fungal infection, animal models and human studies suggest that circulating monocytes also contribute to antifungal immunity. Although human monocyte subsets, defined as either CD14(+)CD16(-) or CD14(+)CD16(+), have been extensively characterized, their respective roles during fungal infection remain undefined. We isolated CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes from healthy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donors and compared their ability to phagocytose and inhibit A. fumigatus conidia. Both monocyte subsets efficiently phagocytose conidia, but only CD14(+)CD16(-) monocytes inhibit conidial germination yet secrete little TNF. In contrast CD14(+)CD16(+) do not inhibit conidial germination and secrete large amounts of TNF. Although CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes differ in their response to dormant conidia, responses are similar if conidia are already germinated at the time of monocyte uptake. Our study demonstrates that functional CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes can be isolated from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donors and that these subsets differ in their response to A. fumigatus conidia."

We report here that similar to several NLRP3 (NALP3, cryopyrin)-activating stimuli, LT activation of the NLRP1b inflammasome involves lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and subsequent cytoplasmic cathepsin B activity. CA-074Me, a potent cathepsin B inhibitor, protects LT-sensitive macrophages from cell death and prevents the activation of caspase-1. RNA interference knockdown of cathepsin B expression, however, cannot prevent LT-mediated cell death, suggesting that CA-074Me may also act on other cellular proteases released during LMP. CA-074Me appears to function downstream of LT translocation to the cytosol (as assessed by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase cleavage), K(+) effluxes, and proteasome activity. The initial increase in cytoplasmic activity of cathepsin B occurs at the same time or shortly before caspase-1 activation but precedes a larger-scale lysosomal destabilization correlated closely with cytolysis. We present results suggesting that LMP may be involved in the activation of the NLRP1b inflammasome."

However, recent studies suggest that saccadic compression does not occur for discrete elements such as dots when they are perceived as unified objects like a rectangle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the magnitude of horizontal vs. vertical compression for Kanizsa figure (a collection of discrete elements unified into single perceptual objects by illusory contours) and control rectangle figures. Participants were presented with Kanizsa and control figures and had to decide whether the horizontal or vertical length of stimulus was longer using the two-alternative force choice method. Our findings show that large but not small Kanizsa figures are perceived as compressed, that such compression is large in the horizontal dimension and small or nil in the vertical dimension. In contrast to recent findings, we found no saccadic compression for control rectangles. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that compression of Kanizsa figure has been overestimated in previous research due to methodological artifacts, and highlight the importance of studying perceptual phenomena by multiple methods."
18073111,1,Nat. Med.,9502015,2009,CD8+ effector T cells contribute to macrophage recruitment and adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.,"Inflammation is increasingly regarded as a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals. In particular, obese adipose tissue shows features characteristic of active local inflammation. At present, however, little is known about the sequence of events that comprises the inflammatory cascade or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that large numbers of CD8(+) effector T cells infiltrated obese epididymal adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas the numbers of CD4(+) helper and regulatory T cells were diminished. The infiltration by CD8(+) T cells preceded the accumulation of macrophages, and immunological and genetic depletion of CD8(+) T cells lowered macrophage infiltration and adipose tissue inflammation and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells to CD8-deficient mice aggravated adipose inflammation. Coculture and other in vitro experiments revealed a vicious cycle of interactions between CD8(+) T cells, macrophages and adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that obese adipose tissue activates CD8(+) T cells, which, in turn, promote the recruitment and activation of macrophages in this tissue. These results support the notion that CD8(+) T cells have an essential role in the initiation and propagation of adipose inflammation."

It has long been documented that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) greatly enhances microvascular permeability; however, the molecular mechanisms controlling VEGF-induced permeability remain unknown. Treatment of microvascular endothelial cells with VEGF led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS are required for VEGF-induced permeability as treatment with the free radical scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, inhibited this effect. Additionally, treatment with VEGF caused ROS-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of both vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin and beta-catenin. Rac1 was required for the VEGF-induced increase in permeability and adherens junction protein phosphorylation. Knockdown of Rac1 inhibited VEGF-induced ROS production consistent with Rac lying upstream of ROS in this pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that VEGF leads to a Rac-mediated generation of ROS, which, in turn, elevates the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and beta-catenin, ultimately regulating adherens junction integrity."
18077336,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Reduced expression of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins in malignant gliomas.,"Malignant gliomas have a distinctive ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma and disrupt the neural extracellular matrix that inhibits motility of axons and normal neural cells. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are among the major inhibitory components in the neural matrix, but surprisingly, some are up-regulated in gliomas and act as pro-invasive signals. In the normal brain, CSPGs are thought to associate with hyaluronic acid and glycoproteins such as the tenascins and link proteins to form the matrix scaffold. Here, we examined for the first time the expression of link proteins in human brain and malignant gliomas. Our results indicate that HAPLN4 and HAPLN2 are the predominant members of this family in the adult human brain but are strongly reduced in the tumor parenchyma. To test if their absence was related to a pro-invasive gain of function of CSPGs, we expressed HAPLN4 in glioma cells in combination with the CSPG brevican. Surprisingly, HAPLN4 increased glioma cell adhesion and migration and even potentiated the motogenic effect of brevican. Further characterization revealed that HAPLN4 expressed in glioma cells was largely soluble and did not reproduce the strong, hyaluronan-independent association of the native protein to brain subcellular membranes. Taken together, our results suggest that the tumor parenchyma is rich in CSPGs that are not associated to HAPLNs and could instead interact with other extracellular matrix proteins produced by glioma cells. This dissociation may contribute to changes in the matrix scaffold caused by invasive glioma cells."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Neural stem cells improve cognition via BDNF in a transgenic model of Alzheimer disease.,"Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation represents an unexplored approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we used aged triple transgenic mice (3xTg-AD) that express pathogenic forms of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin, and tau to investigate the effect of neural stem cell transplantation on AD-related neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, despite widespread and established Ass plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology, hippocampal neural stem cell transplantation rescues the spatial learning and memory deficits in aged 3xTg-AD mice. Remarkably, cognitive function is improved without altering Ass or tau pathology. Instead, the mechanism underlying the improved cognition involves a robust enhancement of hippocampal synaptic density, mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Gain-of-function studies show that recombinant BDNF mimics the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation. Furthermore, loss-of-function studies show that depletion of NSC-derived BDNF fails to improve cognition or restore hippocampal synaptic density. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that neural stem cells can ameliorate complex behavioral deficits associated with widespread Alzheimer disease pathology via BDNF."
18077379,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,DiaA dynamics are coupled with changes in initial origin complexes leading to helicase loading.,"Chromosomal replication initiation requires the regulated formation of dynamic higher order complexes. Escherichia coli ATP-DnaA forms a specific multimer on oriC, resulting in DNA unwinding and DnaB helicase loading. DiaA, a DnaA-binding protein, directly stimulates the formation of ATP-DnaA multimers on oriC and ensures timely replication initiation. In this study, DnaA Phe-46 was identified as the crucial DiaA-binding site required for DiaA-stimulated ATP-DnaA assembly on oriC. Moreover, we show that DiaA stimulation requires only a subgroup of DnaA molecules binding to oriC, that DnaA Phe-46 is also important in the loading of DnaB helicase onto the oriC-DnaA complexes, and that this process also requires only a subgroup of DnaA molecules. Despite the use of only a DnaA subgroup, DiaA inhibited DnaB loading on oriC-DnaA complexes, suggesting that DiaA and DnaB bind to a common DnaA subgroup. A cellular factor can relieve the DiaA inhibition, allowing DnaB loading. Consistently, DnaA F46A caused retarded initiations in vivo in a DiaA-independent manner. It is therefore likely that DiaA dynamics are crucial in the regulated sequential progress of DnaA assembly and DnaB loading. We accordingly propose a model for dynamic structural changes of initial oriC complexes loading DiaA or DnaB helicase."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Intracellular phospholipase A1gamma (iPLA1gamma) is a novel factor involved in coat protein complex I- and Rab6-independent retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex.,"The mammalian intracellular phospholipase A(1) (iPLA(1)) family consists of three members, iPLA(1)alpha/PA-PLA(1), iPLA(1)beta/p125, and iPLA(1)gamma/KIAA0725p. Although iPLA(1)beta has been implicated in organization of the ER-Golgi compartments, little is known about the physiological role of its closest paralog, iPLA(1)gamma. Here we show that iPLA(1)gamma mediates a specific retrograde membrane transport pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. iPLA(1)gamma appeared to be localized to the cytosol, the cis-Golgi, and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that a population of GFP-iPLA(1)gamma was associated with transport carriers moving out from the Golgi complex. Knockdown of iPLA(1)gamma expression by RNAi did not affect the anterograde transport of VSVGts045 but dramatically delayed two types of Golgi-to-ER retrograde membrane transport; that is, transfer of the Golgi membrane into the ER in the presence of brefeldin A and delivery of cholera toxin B subunit from the Golgi complex to the ER. Notably, knockdown of iPLA(1)gamma did not impair COPI- and Rab6-dependent retrograde transports represented by ERGIC-53 recycling and ER delivery of Shiga toxin, respectively. Thus, iPLA(1)gamma is a novel membrane transport factor that contributes to a specific Golgi-to-ER retrograde pathway distinct from presently characterized COPI- and Rab6-dependent pathways."

CD spectra of rac-chloroquine upon addition of heparin provide evidence of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding, support recent findings suggesting that interactions between heparin and antimalarial drugs are largely due to electrostatic interactions, and represent the first reported GAG-induced CD signal of a bicyclic, aromatic compound. The association constant ( approximately 10(3)M(-1)) between chloroquine and heparin was calculated from a UV titration curve and provided additional insight into the nature of the association between these two compounds."
18086875,1,Cell,413066,2009,CD47 is an adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic antibody target on human acute myeloid leukemia stem cells.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is organized as a cellular hierarchy initiated and maintained by a subset of self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC). We hypothesized that increased CD47 expression on human AML LSC contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting their phagocytosis through the interaction of CD47 with an inhibitory receptor on phagocytes. We found that CD47 was more highly expressed on AML LSC than their normal counterparts, and that increased CD47 expression predicted worse overall survival in three independent cohorts of adult AML patients. Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 preferentially enabled phagocytosis of AML LSC and inhibited their engraftment in vivo. Finally, treatment of human AML LSC-engrafted mice with anti-CD47 antibody depleted AML and targeted AML LSC. In summary, increased CD47 expression is an independent, poor prognostic factor that can be targeted on human AML stem cells with blocking monoclonal antibodies capable of enabling phagocytosis of LSC."
18087039,1,Virology,110674,2009,Down-regulation of multiple cell survival proteins in head and neck cancer cells by an apoptogenic mutant of adenovirus type 5.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are one of the leading causes of cancer deaths world wide. Up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins in these cancers is linked to aggressive tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. Infection of two HNSCC cell lines, SCC25 and CAL27 by an Ad5 mutant (lp11w) defective in coding for the viral anti-apoptosis protein, E1B-19K efficiently induced apoptotic cell death. In cells infected with lp11w there was a dramatic down-regulation of EGFR by apoptosis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL and MCL-1 were also down-regulated in lp11w-infected cells compared to uninfected or Ad5-RM infected cells. Infection with lp11w also enhanced sensitivity of the HNSCC cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Our results suggest that adenoviral vectors defective in E1B-19K would be valuable for efficient down-regulation of cell survival proteins and EGFR in epithelial cancers and could be exploited as oncolytic agents to treat HNSCCs."

Commun.,372516,2009,Metabolite regulation of the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana PII and N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase.,"The metabolic control of the interaction between ArabidopsisN-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK) and the PII protein has been studied. Both gel exclusion and affinity chromatography analyses of recombinant, affinity-purified PII (trimeric complex) and NAGK (hexameric complex) showed that NAGK strongly interacted with PII only in the presence of Mg-ATP, and that this process was reversed by 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). Furthermore, metabolites such as arginine, glutamate, citrate, and oxalacetate also exerted a negative effect on the PII-NAGK complex formation in the presence of Mg-ATP. Using chloroplast protein extracts and PII affinity chromatography, NAGK interacted with PII only in the presence of ATP-Mg(2+), and this process was antagonized by 2-OG. These results reveal a complex metabolic control of the PII interaction with NAGK in the chloroplast stroma of higher plants."
18093912,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,In-silico cell surface modeling reveals mechanism for initial steps of B-cell receptor signal transduction.,"Ligand binding to B-cell receptors (BcRs) on the B-cell surface induces crosslinking and phosphorylation of BCRs by the Src family kinases, followed by initiation of signaling. Although the nature of the earliest events following receptor engagement is currently under intensive investigation, the precise connection between crosslinking and the signaling cascade triggering has thus far remained unclear. Using a novel multiscale, agent-based simulation of B-cell surface dynamics, we present a coherent quantitative analysis of the initial stages of B-cell activation following ligand presentation. The simulation reproduces experimental results of H3 uptake, immunoglobulin secretion, immunoelectron photomicrography and FRET. While merging multiple experimental techniques, the simulation captures all essential events in the first twenty seconds following ligand presentation, and is used to make predictions on subsequent molecular events. We show that B-cell activation is mediated through a positive feedback loop between Lyn and ITAM phosphorylation, but that specificity is achieved through a combination of BcR spatial segregation and BcR selective partitioning within lipid rafts following clustering."
18093920,1,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Detection of differentially expressed genes between Erhualian and Large White placentas on day 75 and 90 of gestation.,"BACKGROUND: Placental efficiency is strongly associated with litter size, fetal weight and prenatal mortality. Together with its rapid growth during late gestation, the Large White pig breed shows a significant increase in placental size and weight, but this does not occur in the highly prolific Chinese pig breeds. To understand the molecular basis of placental development during late gestation in Chinese indigenous and Western breeds with different placental efficiency, female placental samples were collected from six pregnant Erhualian gilts at gestation day 75 (E75) and day 90 (E90) and from six pregnant Large White gilts at gestation day 75 (L75) and day 90 (L90). Two female placentas from one sow were used to extract RNA and then pooled in equal volumes. Twelve pooled samples were hybridized to the porcine Affymetrix GeneChip. RESULTS: A total of 226 and 577 transcripts were detected that were differentially expressed between E75 and L75 and between E90 and L90 (p &lt; 0.01, q &lt; 0.2), respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes belong to the class of genes that participate in angiogenesis and development. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of eight selected genes. Significant differential expression of five genes in the VEGF pathway was also detected between the breeds. A search of chromosomal location revealed that 44 differentially expressed genes located to QTL regions related to reproduction. Differential expression of six candidate imprinted genes was also confirmed. Three of the six genes (PLAGL1, DIRAS3, and SLC38A4) showed monoallelic expression in the porcine placenta. CONCLUSION: Our study detected many genes that showed differential expression between placentas of two divergent breed of pigs, and confirmed the imprinting of three genes. These findings help to elucidate the genetic control of placental efficiency and improve the understanding of placental development."
18093941,1,BMC Mol. Biol.,100966983,2009,Transcription of the rat testis-specific Rtdpoz-T1 and -T2 retrogenes during embryo development: co-transcription and frequent exonisation of transposable element sequences.,"BACKGROUND: Retrotransposition is an important evolutionary force for the creation of new and potentially functional intronless genes which are collectively called retrogenes. Many retrogenes are expressed in the testis and the gene products have been shown to actively participate in spermatogenesis and other unique functions of the male germline. We have previously reported a cluster of retrogenes in the rat genome that encode putative TRAF- and POZ-domain proteins. Two of the genes, Rtdpoz-T1 and -T2 (abbreviated as T1 and T2), have further been shown to be expressed specifically in the rat testis. RESULTS: We show here that the T1 and T2 genes are also expressed in the rat embryo up to days 16-17 of development when the genes are silenced until being re-activated in the adult testis. On database interrogation, we find that some T1/T2 exons are chromosomally duplicated as cassettes of 2 or 3 exons consistent with retro-duplication. The embryonic T1/T2 transcripts, characterised by RT-PCR-cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, are further found to have acquired one or more noncoding exons in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). Most importantly, the T1/T2 locus is embedded within a dense field of relics of transposable element (TE) derived mainly from LINE1 and ERV sequences, and the TE sequences are frequently exonised through alternative splicing to form the 5'-UTR sequences of the T1/T2 transcripts. In a case of T1 transcript, the 3'-end is extended into and terminated within an L1 sequence. Since the two genes share a common exon 1 and are, therefore, regulated by a single promoter, a T2-to-T1 co-transcription model is proposed. We further demonstrate that the exonised 5'-UTR TE sequences could lead to the creation of upstream open reading frames resulting in translational repression. CONCLUSION: Exonisation of TE sequences is a frequent event in the transcription of retrogenes during embryonic development and in the testis and may contribute to post-transcriptional regulation of expression of retrogenes."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Understanding structure-mobility relations for perylene tetracarboxydiimide derivatives.,"Discotic mesophases are known for their ability to self-assemble into columnar structures and can serve as semiconducting molecular wires. Charge carrier mobility along these wires strongly depends on molecular packing, which is controlled by intermolecular interactions. By combining wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate packing motifs of a perylene tetracarboxdiimide derivative, a task which is hard to achieve by using a single experimental or theoretical technique. We then relate the charge mobility to the molecular arrangement, both by pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity experiments and simulations based on the non-adiabatic Marcus charge transfer theory. Our results indicate that the helical molecular arrangement with the 45 degrees twist angle between the neighboring molecules favors hole transport in a compound normally considered as an n-type semiconductor. Statistical analysis shows that the transport is strongly suppressed by structural defects. By linking molecular packing and mobility, we eventually provide a pathway to the rational design of perylenediimide derivatives with high charge mobilities."
18094186,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Characteristic pathological findings and effects of ecabet sodium in rat reflux esophagitis.,"AIM: To explore the pathological findings in the entire esophagus in rats with reflux esophagitis, and the effects of ecabet sodium (ES). METHODS: A rat model of chronic acid reflux esophagitis was used. In the treatment group, ES was administered after surgery (n = 16). No drug was administered postoperatively to the esophagitis group (n = 9). Sham-operated rats were used as a control group (n = 5). Rats were sacrificed on day 7 after the operation. The epithelial thickness and leukocyte infiltration were examined in the upper, middle and lower areas of the esophagus. The survival rate, incidence of esophageal ulcer, and mean surface area and number of esophageal ulcers were determined in the esophagitis and ES groups. Esophageal histology was assessed in all three groups. RESULTS: Leukocyte infiltration in the esophagitis group was 26.3 +/- 22.0 in the middle esophagus and 8.2 +/- 4.9 in the upper esophagus, which was significantly greater than that in the controls (1.3 +/- 1.1 and 1.4 +/- 1.0, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). The thickness of the epithelium in the esophagitis group was 210.8 +/- 47.7 microm in the lower esophagus and 204.2 +/- 60.1 microm in the middle esophagus, which was significantly greater than that in the controls (26.0 +/- 5.5 and 21.0 +/- 6.5 microm, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). The mean number of ulcers per animal in the ES group in the entire esophagus was 5.4 +/- 2.5, which was significantly less than that in the esophagitis group (9.0 +/- 3.5) (P &lt; 0.05). The epithelial thickness in the ES group was 97.5 +/- 32.2 microm in the lower esophagus, which was decreased compared with that in the esophagitis group (210.8 +/- 47.7 microm) (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mucosal inflammation extended to the upper esophagus close to the hypopharynx. Our study suggested that ES may have a useful defensive role in reflux esophagitis."
18157088,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Layered functional network analysis of gene expression in human heart failure.,"BACKGROUND: Although dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure (HF), the mechanism underlying DCM is not well understood. Previously, it has been demonstrated that an integrative analysis of gene expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of various diseases. In this study we develop a systems approach by linking public available gene expression data on ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ICM), a main pathological form of DCM, with data from a layered PPI network. We propose that the use of a layered PPI network, as opposed to a traditional PPI network, provides unique insights into the mechanism of DCM. METHODS: Four Cytoscape plugins including BionetBuilder, NetworkAnalyzer, Cerebral and GenePro were used to establish the layered PPI network, which was based upon validated subcellular protein localization data retrieved from the HRPD and Entrez Gene databases. The DAVID function annotation clustering tool was used for gene ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: The assembled layered PPI network was divided into four layers: extracellular, plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. The characteristics of the gene expression pattern of the four layers were compared. In the extracellular and plasma membrane layers, there were more proteins encoded by down-regulated genes than by up-regulated genes, but in the other two layers, the opposite trend was found. GO analysis established that proteins encoded by up-regulated genes, reflecting significantly over-represented biological processes, were mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm layers, while proteins encoded by down-regulated genes were mainly located in the extracellular and plasma membrane layers. The PPI network analysis revealed that the Janus family tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling pathway might play an important role in the development of ICM and could be exploited as a therapeutic target of ICM. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) may also be a potential candidate target, but more evidence is required. CONCLUSION: This study illustrated that by incorporating subcellular localization information into a PPI network based analysis, one can derive greater insights into the mechanisms underlying ICM."
18160040,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Two Prp19-like U-box proteins in the MOS4-associated complex play redundant roles in plant innate immunity.,"Plant Resistance (R) proteins play an integral role in defense against pathogen infection. A unique gain-of-function mutation in the R gene SNC1, snc1, results in constitutive activation of plant immune pathways and enhanced resistance against pathogen infection. We previously found that mutations in MOS4 suppress the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1, and that MOS4 is part of a nuclear complex called the MOS4-Associated Complex (MAC) along with the transcription factor AtCDC5 and the WD-40 protein PRL1. Here we report the immuno-affinity purification of the MAC using HA-tagged MOS4 followed by protein sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. A total of 24 MAC proteins were identified, 19 of which have predicted roles in RNA processing based on their homology to proteins in the Prp19-Complex, an evolutionarily conserved spliceosome-associated complex containing homologs of MOS4, AtCDC5, and PRL1. Among these were two highly similar U-box proteins with homology to the yeast and human E3 ubiquitin ligase Prp19, which we named MAC3A and MAC3B. MAC3B was recently shown to exhibit E3 ligase activity in vitro. Through reverse genetics analysis we show that MAC3A and MAC3B are functionally redundant and are required for basal and R protein-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Like mos4-1 and Atcdc5-1, mac3a mac3b suppresses snc1-mediated autoimmunity. MAC3 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with AtCDC5 in planta. Our results suggest that MAC3A and MAC3B are members of the MAC that function redundantly in the regulation of plant innate immunity."
18160537,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,A missense mutation in the SERPINH1 gene in Dachshunds with osteogenesis imperfecta.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disease occurring in humans and dogs. It is characterized by extremely fragile bones and teeth. Most human and some canine OI cases are caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes encoding the subunits of collagen I. Recently, mutations in the CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes were found to cause some rare forms of human OI. Many OI cases exist where the causative mutation has not yet been found. We investigated Dachshunds with an autosomal recessive form of OI. Genotyping only five affected dogs on the 50 k canine SNP chip allowed us to localize the causative mutation to a 5.82 Mb interval on chromosome 21 by homozygosity mapping. Haplotype analysis of five additional carriers narrowed the interval further down to 4.74 Mb. The SERPINH1 gene is located within this interval and encodes an essential chaperone involved in the correct folding of the collagen triple helix. Therefore, we considered SERPINH1 a positional and functional candidate gene and performed mutation analysis in affected and control Dachshunds. A missense mutation (c.977C&gt;T, p.L326P) located in an evolutionary conserved domain was perfectly associated with the OI phenotype. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for OI in Dachshunds and identified a fifth OI gene."
18162541,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Cooperativity dominates the genomic organization of p53-response elements: a mechanistic view.,"p53-response elements (p53-REs) are organized as two repeats of a palindromic DNA segment spaced by 0 to 20 base pairs (bp). Several experiments indicate that in the vast majority of the human p53-REs there are no spacers between the two repeats; those with spacers, particularly with sizes beyond two nucleotides, are rare. This raises the question of what it indicates about the factors determining the p53-RE genomic organization. Clearly, given the double helical DNA conformation, the orientation of two p53 core domain dimers with respect to each other will vary depending on the spacer size: a small spacer of 0 to 2 bps will lead to the closest p53 dimer-dimer orientation; a 10-bp spacer will locate the p53 dimers on the same DNA face but necessitate DNA looping; while a 5-bp spacer will position the p53 dimers on opposite DNA faces. Here, via conformational analysis we show that when there are 0-2 bp spacers, p53-DNA binding is cooperative; however, cooperativity is greatly diminished when there are spacers with sizes beyond 2 bp. Cooperative binding is broadly recognized to be crucial for biological processes, including transcriptional regulation. Our results clearly indicate that cooperativity of the p53-DNA association dominates the genomic organization of the p53-REs, raising questions of the structural organization and functional roles of p53-REs with larger spacers. We further propose that a dynamic landscape scenario of p53 and p53-REs can better explain the selectivity of the degenerate p53-REs. Our conclusions bear on the evolutionary preference of the p53-RE organization and as such, are expected to have broad implications to other multimeric transcription factor response element organization."
18162544,1,Cell Death Differ.,9437445,2009,Signaling by IL-1beta+IFN-gamma and ER stress converge on DP5/Hrk activation: a novel mechanism for pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis.,"Chronic inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines are important mediators of pancreatic beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We presently show that the cytokines IL-1beta+IFN-gamma and different ER stressors activate the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only member death protein 5 (DP5)/harakiri (Hrk) resulting in beta-cell apoptosis. Chemical ER stress-induced DP5 upregulation is JNK/c-Jun-dependent. DP5 activation by cytokines also involves JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation and is antagonized by JunB. Interestingly, cytokine-inducted DP5 expression precedes ER stress: mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and ER stress are actually a consequence of enhanced DP5 activation by cytokine-mediated nitric oxide formation. Our findings show that DP5 is central for beta-cell apoptosis after different stimuli, and that it can act up- and downstream of ER stress. These observations contribute to solve two important questions, namely the mechanism by which IL-1beta+IFN-gamma induce beta-cell death and the nature of the downstream signals by which ER stress 'convinces' beta-cells to trigger apoptosis."
18162551,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Structural basis of GDP release and gating in G protein coupled Fe2+ transport.,"G proteins are key molecular switches in the regulation of membrane protein function and signal transduction. The prokaryotic membrane protein FeoB is involved in G protein coupled Fe(2+) transport, and is unique in that the G protein is directly tethered to the membrane domain. Here, we report the structure of the soluble domain of FeoB, including the G protein domain, and its assembly into an unexpected trimer. Comparisons between nucleotide free and liganded structures reveal the closed and open state of a central cytoplasmic pore, respectively. In addition, these data provide the first observation of a conformational switch in the nucleotide-binding G5 motif, defining the structural basis for GDP release. From these results, structural parallels are drawn to eukaryotic G protein coupled membrane processes."
18162556,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,A quantitative systems view of the spindle assembly checkpoint.,"The idle assembly checkpoint acts to delay chromosome segregation until all duplicated sister chromatids are captured by the mitotic spindle. This pathway ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the genome. The high fidelity and robustness of this process have made it a subject of intense study in both the experimental and computational realms. A significant number of checkpoint proteins have been identified but how they orchestrate the communication between local spindle attachment and global cytoplasmic signalling to delay segregation is not yet understood. Here, we propose a systems view of the spindle assembly checkpoint to focus attention on the key regulators of the dynamics of this pathway. These regulators in turn have been the subject of detailed cellular measurements and computational modelling to connect molecular function to the dynamics of spindle assembly checkpoint signalling. A review of these efforts reveals the insights provided by such approaches and underscores the need for further interdisciplinary studies to reveal in full the quantitative underpinnings of this cellular control pathway."
18165314,1,Science,404511,2009,Bcl6 mediates the development of T follicular helper cells.,"A fundamental function of CD4+ helper T (T(H)) cells is the regulation of B cell-mediated humoral immunity. Development of T follicular helper (T(FH)) cells that provide help to B cells is mediated by the cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-21 but is independent of TH1, TH2, and TH17 effector cell lineages. Here, we characterize the function of Bcl6, a transcription factor selectively expressed in T(FH) cells. Bcl6 expression is regulated by interleukin-6 and interleukin-21. Bcl6 overexpression induced T(FH)-related gene expression and inhibited other T(H) lineage cell differentiation in a DNA binding-dependent manner. Moreover, Bcl6 deficiency in T cells resulted in impaired T(FH) cell development and germinal center reactions, and altered production of other effector T cell subsets. Our data thus illustrate that Bcl6 is required for programming of T(FH) cell generation."
18167341,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,Dynamical mechanism for subcellular alternans in cardiac myocytes.,"RATIONALE: Cardiac repolarization alternans is an arrhythmogenic rhythm disturbance, manifested in individual myocytes as a beat-to-beat alternation of action potential durations and intracellular calcium transient magnitudes. Recent experimental studies have reported &quot;subcellular alternans,&quot; in which distinct regions of an individual cell are seen to have counterphase calcium alternations, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. Although previous theoretical work has proposed a possible dynamical mechanism for subcellular alternans formation, no direct evidence for this mechanism has been reported in vitro. Rather, experimental studies have generally invoked fixed subcellular heterogeneities in calcium-cycling characteristics as the mechanism of subcellular alternans formation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have generalized the previously proposed dynamical mechanism to predict a simple pacing algorithm by which subcellular alternans can be induced in isolated cardiac myocytes in the presence or absence of fixed subcellular heterogeneity. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using computational modeling and to confirm it experimentally in isolated cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this dynamical mechanism may account for previous reports of subcellular alternans seen in statically paced, intact tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a physiologically realistic computational model of a cardiac myocyte, we show that our predicted pacing algorithm induces subcellular alternans in a manner consistent with theoretical predictions. We then use a combination of real-time electrophysiology and fluorescent calcium imaging to implement this protocol experimentally and show that it robustly induces subcellular alternans in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Finally, we use computational modeling to demonstrate that subcellular alternans can indeed be dynamically induced during static pacing of 1D fibers of myocytes during tissue-level spatially discordant alternans. CONCLUSION: Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence that subcellular alternans can be dynamically induced in cardiac myocytes. This proposed mechanism may contribute to subcellular alternans formation in the intact heart."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Mutations of cytosolic loop residues impair assembly and maturation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,"Mechanisms that regulate early events in the biogenesis of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 AChR) are not well understood. Data presented here show that single amino acid mutations in the cytoplasmic loop of the alpha7 AChR, between position 335 and 343, abolish or attenuate expression of mature pentameric alpha7 AChRs in both human embryonic kidney tsA201 (HEK) and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Although the number of mature alpha7 AChRs is increased significantly in the presence of the chaperone protein resistant to inhibitors of cholineesterase-3 in HEK cells, sucrose gradient sedimentation reveals that the vast majority of alpha7 subunits are aggregated or improperly assembled. Transfection of alpha7 AChRs in SH-SY5Y cells, which endogenously express the alpha7 AChR, results in a much larger fraction of subunits assembled into mature AChRs. Thus, efficient assembly of alpha7 AChRs is influenced by several regions of the large cytoplasmic domain, as well perhaps by other parts of its structure, and requires as yet unknown factors not required by other AChR subtypes."
18172215,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,VGLUT1 and VGAT are sorted to the same population of synaptic vesicles in subsets of cortical axon terminals.,"Glutamate and GABA mediate most of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission; they are taken up and accumulated in synaptic vesicles by specific vesicular transporters named VGLUT1-3 and VGAT, respectively. Recent studies show that VGLUT2 and VGLUT3 are co-expressed with VGAT. Because of the relevance this information has for our understanding of synaptic physiology and plasticity, we investigated whether VGLUT1 and VGAT are co-expressed in rat cortical neurons. In cortical cultures and layer V cortical terminals we observed a population of terminals expressing VGLUT1 and VGAT. Post-embedding immunogold studies showed that VGLUT1+/VGAT+ terminals formed both symmetric and asymmetric synapses. Triple-labeling studies revealed GABAergic synapses expressing VGLUT1 and glutamatergic synapses expressing VGAT. Immunoisolation studies showed that anti-VGAT immunoisolated vesicles contained VGLUT1 and anti-VGLUT1 immunoisolated vesicles contained VGAT. Finally, vesicles containing VGAT resident in glutamatergic terminals undergo active recycling. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in neocortex VGLUT1 and VGAT are co-expressed in a subset of axon terminals forming both symmetric and asymmetric synapses, that VGLUT1 and VGAT are sorted to the same vesicles and that vesicles at synapses expressing the vesicular heterotransporter participate in the exo-endocytotic cycle."
18178614,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,Recent insights into the structure of Toll-like receptors and post-translational modifications of their associated signalling proteins.,"TLRs (Toll-like receptors) are essential modulators of the innate immune response through their ability to respond to a diverse range of conserved structures within microbes. Recent advances have been made in our understanding of the initiation of TLR signals as a result of the elucidation of crystal structures of TLRs interacting with their ligands. Most notably the structure of TLR1/2 with triacylated lipopeptide and TLR4 in a complex with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and MD2 has been solved. These explain the basis for TLR dimerization which initiates signalling. Modifications of TLRs and their receptor proximal signalling proteins have also been uncovered. Phosphorylation of adaptor proteins and ubiquitination (both Lys48- and Lys63-linked) of TLRs, IRAKs (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase), Pellinos and TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) have been described, which promote signalling and lead to signal termination. A detailed molecular account of the initiation and termination of TLR signalling is presented."
18182486,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Structures of the phosphorylated and VO(3)-bound 2H-phosphatase domain of Sts-2.,"The C-terminal domain of the suppressor of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling 1 and 2 (Sts-1 and -2) proteins has homology to the 2H-phosphatase family of enzymes. The phosphatase activity of the correspondent Sts-1 domain, Sts-1(PGM), is key for its ability to negatively regulate the signaling of membrane-bound receptors including TCR and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A nucleophilic histidine, which is transiently phosphorylated during the phosphatase reaction, is essential for the activity. Here, we present the crystal structure of Sts-2(PGM) in the phosphorylated active form and bound to VO(3), which represent structures of an intermediate and of a transition state analogue along the path of the dephosphorylation reaction. In the former structure, the proposed nucleophilic His366 is the only phoshorylated residue and is stabilized by several interactions with conserved basic residues within the active site. In the latter structure, the vanadium atom sits in the middle of a trigonal bipyramid formed by the three oxygen atoms of the VO(3) molecule, atom NE2 of His366, and an apical water molecule W(a). The V-NE2 bond length (2.25 A) suggests that VO(3) is not covalently attached to His366 and that the reaction mechanism is partially associative. The two structures also suggest a role for Glu476 in activating a uniquely positioned water molecule. In both structures, the conformation of the active site is remarkably similar to the one seen in apo-Sts-2(PGM) suggesting that the spatial arrangement of the catalytic residues does not change during the dephosphorylation reaction."

Chem.,9716531,2009,Targeting the cubilin receptor through the vitamin B(12) uptake pathway: cytotoxicity and mechanistic insight through fluorescent Re(I) delivery.,"The intrinsic factor (IF) vitamin B(12) ileum anchored receptor, cubilin, mediates endocytotic uptake of the IF complex of vitamin B(12) to the blood serum. This receptor was targeted for the selective delivery and accumulation of a new bioprobe, a B(12) conjugate of rhenium 2, in the cubilin expressing placental choriocarcinoma BeWo cell line. Competitive uptake and cytotoxicity assays of 2 were investigated and interactions with nuclear DNA explored. In addition, the mechanism of internalization of 2 was confirmed to proceed in an IF-cubilin mediated fashion via siRNA transfection experiments. These studies show the great potential of cubilin as a new target for the delivery of B(12) based conjugates for cancer diagnostics and/or treatment."
18184036,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,The AMPK agonist AICAR inhibits the growth of EGFRvIII-expressing glioblastomas by inhibiting lipogenesis.,"The EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is activated in many cancers including glioblastoma, yet mTOR inhibitors have largely failed to show efficacy in the clinic. Rapamycin promotes feedback activation of Akt in some patients, potentially underlying clinical resistance and raising the need for alternative approaches to block mTOR signaling. AMPK is a metabolic checkpoint that integrates growth factor signaling with cellular metabolism, in part by negatively regulating mTOR. We used pharmacological and genetic approaches to determine whether AMPK activation could block glioblastoma growth and cellular metabolism, and we examined the contribution of EGFR signaling in determining response in vitro and in vivo. The AMPK-agonist AICAR, and activated AMPK adenovirus, inhibited mTOR signaling and blocked the growth of glioblastoma cells expressing the activated EGFR mutant, EGFRvIII. Across a spectrum of EGFR-activated cancer cell lines, AICAR was more effective than rapamycin at blocking tumor cell proliferation, despite less efficient inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Unexpectedly, addition of the metabolic products of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis rescued the growth inhibitory effect of AICAR, whereas inhibition of these lipogenic enzymes mimicked AMPK activation, thus demonstrating that AMPK blocked tumor cell proliferation primarily through inhibition of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Most importantly, AICAR treatment in mice significantly inhibited the growth and glycolysis (as measured by (18)fluoro-2-deoxyglucose microPET) of glioblastoma xenografts engineered to express EGFRvIII, but not their parental counterparts. These results suggest a mechanism by which AICAR inhibits the proliferation of EGFRvIII expressing glioblastomas and point toward a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting EGFR-activated cancers."
18184589,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor depends on amyloid aggregation state in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cortex occurs early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since BDNF plays a critical role in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and memory, BDNF reduction may contribute to synaptic and cellular loss and memory deficits characteristic of AD. In vitro evidence suggests that amyloid-beta (A beta) contributes to BDNF downregulation in AD, but the specific A beta aggregation state responsible for this downregulation in vivo is unknown. In the present study, we examined cortical levels of BDNF mRNA in three different transgenic AD mouse models harboring mutations in APP resulting in A beta overproduction, and in a genetic mouse model of Down syndrome. Two of the three A beta transgenic strains (APP(NLh) and TgCRND8) exhibited significantly decreased cortical BDNF mRNA levels compared with wild-type mice, whereas neither the other strain (APP(swe)/PS-1) nor the Down syndrome mouse model (Ts65Dn) was affected. Only APP(NLh) and TgCRND8 mice expressed high A beta(42)/A beta(40) ratios and larger SDS-stable A beta oligomers (approximately 115 kDa). TgCRND8 mice exhibited downregulation of BDNF transcripts III and IV; transcript IV is also downregulated in AD. Furthermore, in all transgenic mouse strains, there was a correlation between levels of large oligomers, A beta(42)/A beta(40), and severity of BDNF decrease. These data show that the amount and species of A beta vary among transgenic mouse models of AD and are negatively correlated with BDNF levels. These findings also suggest that the effect of A beta on decreased BDNF expression is specific to the aggregation state of A beta and is dependent on large oligomers."
18188152,1,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Phosphorylation of zona occludens-2 by protein kinase C epsilon regulates its nuclear exportation.,"Here, we have analyzed the subcellular destiny of newly synthesized tight junction protein zona occludens (ZO)-2. After transfection in sparse cells, 74% of cells exhibit ZO-2 at the nucleus, and after 18 h the value decreases to 17%. The mutation S369A located within the nuclear exportation signal 1 of ZO-2 impairs the nuclear export of the protein. Because Ser369 represents a putative protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, we tested the effect of PKC inhibition and stimulation on the nuclear export of ZO-2. Our results strongly suggest that the departure of ZO-2 from the nucleus is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser369 by novel PKCepsilon. To test the route taken by ZO-2 from synthesis to the plasma membrane, we devised a novel nuclear microinjection assay in which the nucleus served as a reservoir for anti-ZO-2 antibody. Through this assay, we demonstrate that a significant amount of newly synthesized ZO-2 goes into the nucleus and is later relocated to the plasma membrane. These results constitute novel information for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular fate of ZO-2."
18188153,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Human cytomegalovirus UL28 and UL29 open reading frames encode a spliced mRNA and stimulate accumulation of immediate-early RNAs.,"We have identified a spliced transcript that contains sequences from the HCMV UL29 and UL28 open reading frames. It contains amino-terminal UL29 sequences followed by UL28 sequences, and it includes a poly(A) signal derived from the 3'-untranslated region following the UL26 open reading frame. UL29/28 RNA is expressed with early kinetics, and a virus containing a FLAG epitope inserted at the amino terminus of UL29 expressed a tagged approximately 79-kDa protein, pUL29/28, that was detected at 6 h postinfection. The virus also expressed a less-abundant tagged 41-kDa protein, which corresponds in size to a protein that could be produced by translation of an unspliced UL29/28 transcript. Consistent with this prediction, both unspliced and spliced UL29/28 transcript was present in RNA isolated from polysomes. FLAG-tagged protein from the UL29/28 locus accumulated within nuclear viral replication centers during the early phase of infection. Late after infection it was present in the cytoplasm as well, and the protein was present and resistant to proteinase treatment in partially purified preparations of viral particles. Disruption of the UL29/28 locus by mutation resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the levels of DNA replication along with a similar reduction in virus yield. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed an approximately 2-fold decrease in immediate-early gene expression at 4 to 10 h postinfection compared to the wild-type virus, and transient expression of pUL29/28 activated the major immediate-early promoter. Our results argue that the UL29/28 locus contributes to activation of immediate-early gene expression."
18188154,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,"Ahi1, whose human ortholog is mutated in Joubert syndrome, is required for Rab8a localization, ciliogenesis and vesicle trafficking.","The primary non-motile cilium, a membrane-ensheathed, microtubule-bundled organelle, extends from virtually all cells and is important for development. Normal functioning of the cilium requires proper axoneme assembly, membrane biogenesis and ciliary protein localization, in tight coordination with the intraflagellar transport system and vesicular trafficking. Disruptions at any level can induce severe alterations in cell function, giving rise to a myriad of human genetic diseases known as ciliopathies. Here we show that the Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi1) gene, whose human ortholog is mutated in Joubert syndrome, regulates cilium formation via its interaction with Rab8a, a small GTPase critical for polarized membrane trafficking. We find that the Ahi1 protein localizes to a single centriole, the mother centriole, which becomes the basal body of the primary cilium. In order to determine whether Ahi1 functions in ciliogenesis, loss of function analysis of Ahi1 was performed in cell culture models of ciliogenesis. Knockdown of Ahi1 expression by shRNAi in cells or targeted deletion of Ahi1 (Ahi1 knockout mouse) leads to impairments in ciliogenesis. In Ahi1-knockdown cells, Rab8a is destabilized and does not properly localize to the basal body. Since Rab8a is implicated in vesicular trafficking, we next examined this process in Ahi1-knockdown cells. Defects in the trafficking of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane to the Golgi and back to the plasma membrane were observed in Ahi1-knockdown cells. Overall, our data indicate that the distribution and functioning of Rab8a is regulated by Ahi1, not only affecting cilium formation, but also vesicle transport."
18188155,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Binding and cleavage specificities of human Argonaute2.,"The endonuclease Argonaute2 (Ago2) mediates the degradation of the target mRNA within the RNA-induced silencing complex. We determined the binding and cleavage properties of recombinant human Ago2. Human Ago2 was unable to cleave preformed RNA duplexes and exhibited weaker binding affinity for RNA duplexes compared with the single strand RNA. The enzyme exhibited greater RNase H activity in the presence of Mn2+ compared with Mg2+. Human Ago2 exhibited weaker binding affinities and reduced cleavage activities for antisense RNAs with either a 5'-terminal hydroxyl or abasic nucleotide. Binding kinetics suggest that the 5'-terminal heterocycle base nucleates the interaction between the enzyme and the antisense RNA, and the 5'-phosphate stabilizes the interaction. Mn2+ ameliorated the effects of the 5'-terminal hydroxyl or abasic nucleotide on Ago2 cleavage activity and binding affinity. Nucleotide substitutions at the 3' terminus of the antisense RNA had no effect on human Ago2 cleavage activity, whereas 2'-methoxyethyl substitutions at position 2 reduced binding and cleavage activity and 12-14 reduced the cleavage activity. RNase protection assays indicated that human Ago2 interacts with the first 14 nucleotides at the 5'-pole of the antisense RNA. Human Ago2 preloaded with the antisense RNA exhibited greater binding affinities for longer sense RNAs suggesting that the enzyme interacts with regions in the sense RNA outside the site for antisense hybridization. Finally, transiently expressed human Ago2 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells contained the double strand RNA-binding protein human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, trans-activating response RNA-binding protein, and deletion mutants of Ago2 showed that trans-activating response RNA-binding protein interacts with the PIWI domain of the enzyme."
18191223,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Dexrazoxane-afforded protection against chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity in vivo: effective rescue of cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death.,"BACKGROUND: Dexrazoxane (DEX, ICRF-187) is the only clinically approved cardioprotectant against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. It has been traditionally postulated to undergo hydrolysis to iron-chelating agent ADR-925 and to prevent anthracycline-induced oxidative stress, progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration and subsequent non-programmed cell death. However, the additional capability of DEX to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis has remained unsubstantiated under clinically relevant in vivo conditions. METHODS: Chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity was induced in rabbits by repeated daunorubicin (DAU) administrations (3 mg kg(-1) weekly for 10 weeks). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling) assay and activities of caspases 3/7, 8, 9 and 12. Lipoperoxidation was assayed using HPLC determination of myocardial malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal immunodetection. RESULTS: Dexrazoxane (60 mg kg(-1)) co-treatment was capable of overcoming DAU-induced mortality, left ventricular dysfunction, profound structural damage of the myocardium and release of cardiac troponin T and I to circulation. Moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that DEX affords significant and nearly complete cardioprotection against anthracycline-induced apoptosis in vivo and effectively suppresses the complex apoptotic signalling triggered by DAU. In individual animals, the severity of apoptotic parameters significantly correlated with cardiac function. However, this effective cardioprotection occurred without a significant decrease in anthracycline-induced lipoperoxidation. CONCLUSION: This study identifies inhibition of apoptosis as an important target for effective cardioprotection against chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity and suggests that lipoperoxidation-independent mechanisms are involved in the cardioprotective action of DEX."
18191224,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Endocytosis and endosomal regulation of the S-receptor kinase during the self-incompatibility response in Brassica oleracea.,"Intracellular trafficking of plant receptor kinases (PRKs) is a key step in regulation of cellular signaling. Our current knowledge in this field is based on systems that address signaling pathways affecting the whole cell. There are, however, signaling phenomena that add a further layer of complexity. In the Brassica self-incompatibility response, a single cell can adequately respond to two opposite stimuli: accepting cross-pollen and rejecting self-pollen simultaneously. To understand how PRK signaling can influence the coexistence of two seemingly exclusive states of the cell, we investigated the subcellular localization and internalization of the S-receptor kinase (SRK) involved in the self-incompatibility response of Brassica oleracea. Here, we describe the unusual subcellular distribution of SRK3, which localizes predominantly to intracellular compartments and to a much lesser extent to the plasma membrane. Using an anti-SRK antibody that fully substitutes for the natural ligand, we demonstrate that the interaction with the receptor takes place at the plasma membrane and is followed by SRK internalization in endosomes that are enriched in the SRK negative regulator Thioredoxin-h-like1."
18191225,1,Genetics,374636,2009,The complex tale of the achaete-scute complex: a paradigmatic case in the analysis of gene organization and function during development.,"The achaete-scute gene complex (AS-C) contains four genes encoding transcription factors of the bHLH family, achaete, scute, lethal of scute, and asense located in 40 kb of DNA containing multiple cis-regulatory position-specific enhancers. These genes play a key role in the commitment of epidermal cells toward a neural fate, promoting the formation of both sensory organs in the peripheral nervous system (bristles) of the adult and of neuroblasts in the central nervous system of the embryo. The analysis of the AS-C initially focused on the variations in positional specificity of effects of achaete (ac) and scute (sc) alleles on macrochaete bristle pattern in the Drosophila adult epidermis, and from there it evolved as a key entry point into understanding the molecular bases of pattern formation and cell commitment. In this perspective, we describe how the study of the AS-C has contributed to the understanding of eukaryotic gene organization and the dissection of the developmental mechanisms underlying pattern formation."

Previously, we screened for alpha-synuclein substitution mutants that prevent fibril formation of both wild-type and Parkinson's disease-linked alpha-synuclein variants. In the present study, we show that short synthetic peptides derived from these mutant sequences not only prevented alpha-synuclein fibrillation but also dissolved preformed alpha-synuclein aggregates in vitro. The hexapeptide PGVTAV, which was the shortest peptide that retained the ability to block alpha-synuclein fibrillation, may serve as a lead compound for the development of therapeutics for Parkinson's disease."

In this paper the available information concerning the molecular mechanism of HPPD inhibition by NTBC, originating from experimental investigations as well as theoretical modeling, has been collected. It is supplemented by results of additional theoretical DFT and/or MP2 calculations of the energetic effects of individual elementary molecular transformations. All these data are discussed and a consistent picture of HPPD inhibition by NTBC is proposed."
18195355,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,How the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT-1 contributes to an obesity phenotype in Caenorhabditits elegans.,"BACKGROUND: Amino acid absorption in the form of di- and tripeptides is mediated by the intestinal proton-coupled peptide transporter PEPT-1 (formally OPT-2) in Caenorhabditits elegans. Transporter-deficient animals (pept-1(lg601)) show impaired growth, slowed postembryonal development and major changes in amino acid status. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that abolished intestinal peptide transport also leads to major metabolic alterations that culminate in a two fold increase in total body fat content. Feeding of C. elegans with [U-(13)C]-labelled E. coli revealed a decreased de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids in pept-1(lg601) and reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. mRNA profiling revealed increased transcript levels of enzymes/transporters needed for peroxisomal beta-oxidation and decreased levels for those required for fatty acid synthesis, elongation and desaturation. As a prime and most fundamental process that may account for the increased fat content in pept-1(lg601) we identified a highly accelerated absorption of free fatty acids from the bacterial food in the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: The influx of free fatty acids into intestinal epithelial cells is strongly dependent on alterations in intracellular pH which is regulated by the interplay of PEPT-1 and the sodium-proton exchanger NHX-2. We here provide evidence for a central mechanism by which the PEPT-1/NHX-2 system strongly influences the in vivo fat content of C. elegans. Loss of PEPT-1 decreases intestinal proton influx leading to a higher uptake of free fatty acids with fat accumulation whereas loss of NHX-2 causes intracellular acidification by the PEPT-1 mediated proton/dipeptide symport with an almost abolished uptake of fatty acids and a lean phenotype."

Neurosci.,9809671,2009,SAP97 and CASK mediate sorting of NMDA receptors through a previously unknown secretory pathway.,"Synaptic plasticity is dependent on the differential sorting, delivery and retention of neurotransmitter receptors, but the mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. We found that differential sorting of glutamate receptor subtypes began in the endoplasmic reticulum of rat hippocampal neurons. As AMPA receptors (AMPARs) were trafficked to the plasma membrane via the conventional somatic Golgi network, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were diverted from the somatic endoplasmic reticulum into a specialized endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment that bypasses somatic Golgi, merging instead with dendritic Golgi outposts. This endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment was composed of highly mobile vesicles containing the NMDAR subunits NR1 and NR2B, the microtubule-dependent motor protein KIF17, and the postsynaptic adaptor proteins CASK and SAP97. Our data demonstrate that the retention and trafficking of NMDARs in this endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment requires both CASK and SAP97. These findings indicate that NMDARs are sorted away from AMPARs via a non-conventional secretory pathway that utilizes dendritic Golgi outposts."
18199837,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Nucleotide-dependent conformational states of actin.,"The influence of the state of the bound nucleotide (ATP, ADP-Pi, or ADP) on the conformational free-energy landscape of actin is investigated. Nucleotide-dependent folding of the DNase-I binding (DB) loop in monomeric actin and the actin trimer is carried out using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) calculations accelerated with a multiscale implementation of the metadynamics algorithm. Additionally, an investigation of the opening and closing of the actin nucleotide binding cleft is performed. Nucleotide-dependent free-energy profiles for all of these conformational changes are calculated within the framework of metadynamics. We find that in ADP-bound monomer, the folded and unfolded states of the DB loop have similar relative free-energy. This result helps explain the experimental difficulty in obtaining an ordered crystal structure for this region of monomeric actin. However, we find that in the ADP-bound actin trimer, the folded DB loop is stable and in a free-energy minimum. It is also demonstrated that the nucleotide binding cleft favors a closed conformation for the bound nucleotide in the ATP and ADP-Pi states, whereas the ADP state favors an open confirmation, both in the monomer and trimer. These results suggest a mechanism of allosteric interactions between the nucleotide binding cleft and the DB loop. This behavior is confirmed by an additional simulation that shows the folding free-energy as a function of the nucleotide cleft width, which demonstrates that the barrier for folding changes significantly depending on the value of the cleft width."

However, the molecular identity of the target protein is unclear. In this study, we show that the previously uncharacterized human two-pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2) are endolysosomal proteins, that NAADP-mediated calcium signals are enhanced by overexpression of TPC1 and attenuated after knockdown of TPC1, and that mutation of a single highly conserved residue within a putative pore region abrogated calcium release by NAADP. Thus, TPC1 is critical for NAADP action and is likely the long sought after target channel for NAADP."
18200045,1,Genetics,374636,2009,Distinctive responses to nitrogen starvation in the dominant active mutants of the fission yeast Rheb GTPase.,"Rheb, a Ras-like small GTPase conserved from human to yeast, controls Tor kinase and plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth depending on extracellular conditions. Rhb1 (a fission yeast homolog of Rheb) regulates amino acid uptake as well as response to nitrogen starvation. In this study, we generated two mutants, rhb1-DA4 and rhb1-DA8, and characterized them genetically. The V17A mutation within the G1 box defined for the Ras-like GTPases was responsible for rhb1-DA4 and Q52R I76F within the switch II domain for rhb1-DA8. In fission yeast, two events--the induction of the meiosis-initiating gene mei2+ and cell division without cell growth--are a typical response to nitrogen starvation. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, Rheb stimulates Tor kinase, which, in turn, suppresses the response to nitrogen starvation. While amino acid uptake was prevented by both rhb1-DA4 and rhb1-DA8 in a dominant fashion, the response to nitrogen starvation was prevented only by rhb1-DA4. rhb1-DA8 thereby allowed genetic dissection of the Rheb-dependent signaling cascade. We postulate that the signaling cascade may branch below Rhb1 or Tor2 and regulate the amino acid uptake and response to nitrogen starvation independently."
18202719,1,Genetics,374636,2009,The genetic basis of transgressive ovary size in honeybee workers.,"Ovarioles are the functional unit of the female insect reproductive organs and the number of ovarioles per ovary strongly influences egg-laying rate and fecundity. Social evolution in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) has resulted in queens with 200-360 total ovarioles and workers with usually 20 or less. In addition, variation in ovariole number among workers relates to worker sensory tuning, foraging behavior, and the ability to lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. To study the genetic architecture of worker ovariole number, we performed a series of crosses between Africanized and European bees that differ in worker ovariole number. Unexpectedly, these crosses produced transgressive worker phenotypes with extreme ovariole numbers that were sensitive to the social environment. We used a new selective pooled DNA interval mapping approach with two Africanized backcrosses to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the transgressive ovary phenotype. We identified one QTL on chromosome 11 and found some evidence for another QTL on chromosome 2. Both QTL regions contain plausible functional candidate genes. The ovariole number of foragers was correlated with the sugar concentration of collected nectar, supporting previous studies showing a link between worker physiology and foraging behavior. We discuss how the phenotype of extreme worker ovariole numbers and the underlying genetic factors we identified could be linked to the development of queen traits."
18202720,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Cooperation between the INO80 complex and histone chaperones determines adaptation of stress gene transcription in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"In yeast, environmental stresses provoke sudden and dramatic increases in gene expression at stress-inducible loci. Stress gene transcription is accompanied by the transient eviction of histones from the promoter and the transcribed regions of these genes. We found that mutants defective in subunits of the INO80 complex, as well as in several histone chaperone systems, exhibit extended expression windows that can be correlated with a distinct delay in histone redeposition during adaptation. Surprisingly, Ino80 became associated with the ORFs of stress genes in a stress-specific way, suggesting a direct function in the repression during adaptation. This recruitment required elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II but none of the histone modifications that are usually associated with active transcription, such as H3 K4/K36 methylation. A mutant lacking the Asf1-associated H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 or Asf1 itself also showed enhanced stress-induced transcript levels. Genetic data, however, suggest that Asf1 and Rtt109 function in parallel with INO80 to restore histone homeostasis, whereas Spt6 seems to have a function that overlaps that of the chromatin remodeler. Thus, chromatin remodeling by INO80 in cooperation with Spt6 determines the shape of the expression profile under acute stress conditions, possibly by an elongation-dependent mechanism."

Biol.,2985088R,2009,The LIM-homeodomain protein ISL1 activates insulin gene promoter directly through synergy with BETA2.,"The LIM-homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 (islet factor 1) is essential for pancreatic islet cell and dorsal mesenchyme development. Mutations in ISL1 are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and type 2 diabetes. Whether ISL1 plays a role in the insulin gene expression has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we show that ISL1 can synergistically activate insulin gene transcription with BETA2 in pancreatic beta cells. The protein-protein interactions of ISL1 and BETA2 are directly mediated by the LIM domains of ISL1 and the basic helix-loop-helix domain of BETA2. Deletion of the two LIM domains of ISL1 enhances the transcriptional activation of the insulin gene, indicating a key role for the homeodomain in activating the insulin promoter. Furthermore, ISL1 can bind with the A3/4 box in the rat insulin gene capital I, Ukrainian promoter through its homeodomain. ISL1 expression is up-regulated at the mRNA level in type 2 diabetes (db/db mouse model) but down-regulated by dexamethasone in rat insulinoma cells. These results suggest that ISL1 is a transcriptional activator for insulin gene expression, and the interactions of ISL1 with BETA2 are required for the transcriptional activity of the insulin gene. Reduction in Isl1 gene expression appears to be involved in the impairment of insulin expression mediated by dexamethasone."
18203920,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Transglutaminase 2 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity are correlated in epithelial membranes and are abnormal in cystic fibrosis.,"Tissue transglutaminase (tgase2) is a multifunctional enzyme that crosslinks proteins but also acts as a G-protein, differential functions regulated by calcium and GTP. In the epithelial cell membrane, we show that manipulation of tgase2 function by monodansylcadaverine or retinoic acid (RA) alters the activity of a membrane-bound protein kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, nm23-H1/H2) that is known to control G-protein function. We find that NDPK function is abnormally low in cystic fibrosis but can be restored by RA treatment in vitro. Our data suggest that tgase2 is overexpressed in cystic fibrosis and affects NDPK function."
18206651,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,The large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel interacts with the apolipoprotein ApoA1.,"Owing to the multifaceted functions of the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK), identification of protein-protein interactions is essential in determining BK regulation. A yeast two-hybrid screening of a cochlear cDNA library revealed a BK-ApoA1 interaction. Patch clamp recordings of excised membrane patches from transfected HEK293 cells showed that ApoA1 inhibits the BK alpha-subunit by significantly increasing activation and deactivation times, and shifting half-activation voltage to more positive potentials. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations verified the BK-ApoA1 interaction using excised sensory epithelium and ganglia. Additionally, immunocolocalization studies revealed BK and ApoA1 expression in both receptor cells and auditory neurons. These data suggest new avenues of investigation, given the importance of apolipoproteins in neurological diseases."
18208323,1,Retrovirology,101216893,2009,Enhanced macrophage tropism of HIV in brain and lymphoid tissues is associated with sensitivity to the broadly neutralizing CD4 binding site antibody b12.,"Macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues are an important cellular reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, particularly in the later stages of disease. Macrophage-tropic HIV strains have an enhanced capacity to enter cells expressing low levels of CD4 through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we use a panel of primary HIV envelopes from brain and lymphoid tissues to examine the relationship between neutralization sensitivity to reagents targeting the CD4 binding site and virus entry into macrophages. Neutralization assays using pseudotyped viruses showed an association between the capacity of HIV to enter macrophages and increased sensitivity to the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) b12, which recognizes a conserved epitope overlapping the CD4 binding site, but not sensitivity to soluble CD4 (sCD4) or b6, a non-neutralizing CD4 binding site mAb. Furthermore, loss of an N-linked glycosylation site at position 386 in the V4 region of Env enhanced macrophage tropism together with b12 sensitivity, but not neutralization by sCD4, b6, or a broadly neutralizing AIDS patient serum. These findings suggest that exposure of the b12 epitope, rather than exposure of the CD4 binding site per se, enhances HIV macrophage tropism, possibly by exposing a region on the outer domain of gp120 that is initially recognized by CD4. These findings suggest overlap between specific gp120 determinants in or near the b12 epitope and those conferring macrophage tropism."
18216238,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Serotonin released from amacrine neurons is scavenged and degraded in bipolar neurons in the retina.,"The neurotransmitter serotonin is synthesized in the retina by one type of amacrine neuron but accumulates in bipolar neurons in many vertebrates. The mechanisms, functions and purpose underlying serotonin accumulation in bipolar cells remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that exogenous serotonin transiently accumulates in a distinct type of bipolar neuron. KCl-mediated depolarization causes the depletion of serotonin from amacrine neurons and, subsequently, serotonin is taken-up by bipolar neurons. The accumulation of endogenous and exogenous serotonin by bipolar neurons is blocked by selective reuptake inhibitors. Exogenous serotonin is specifically taken-up by bipolar neurons even when serotonin-synthesizing amacrine neurons are destroyed; excluding the possibility that serotonin diffuses through gap junctions from amacrine into bipolar neurons. Further, inhibition of monoamine oxidase A prevents the degradation of serotonin in bipolar neurons, suggesting that monoamine oxidase A is present in these neurons. However, the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 is present only in amacrine cells suggesting that serotonin is not transported into synaptic vesicles and reused as a transmitter in the bipolar neurons. We conclude that the serotonin-accumulating bipolar neurons perform glial functions in the retina by actively transporting and degrading serotonin that is synthesized in neighboring amacrine cells."

Here we report the general peroxidase activity of G-quadruplex-hemin complexes and discuss the connection between peroxidase activity and G-quadruplex structures. The high peroxidase activity of hemin complexed with intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex-forming sequences in gene promoters (such as c-Myc, VEGF, c-Kit21, HIF-1alpha, and RET) may imply a potential mechanism of hemin-mediated cellular injury. This peroxidase activity has also been demonstrated to be applicable for screening G-quadruplex ligands (potential anticancer reagents) using colorimetric and visual detection strategies."

The neutral dithieno-1,2-dihydro-1,2-diborin has a twisted diborin ring in which both the sigma-pi and p-pi* orbital interactions between the bithiophene pi framework and the B-B bond moiety effectively take place, giving rise to an absorption that is significantly red-shifted compared with that of the parent bithiophene. Upon a two-electron reduction, the dithienodiborin pi framework becomes planar and has a characteristic peripheral pi conjugation through the B-B bond with 14 pi electrons. Furthermore, the dianion salts show an intriguing countercation effect on their photophysical properties, indicative of possible electronic tuning by the countercations."
18216271,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Identification of linear epitopes in Bacillus anthracis protective antigen bound by neutralizing antibodies.,"Protective antigen (PA), the binding subunit of anthrax toxin, is the major component in the current anthrax vaccine, but the fine antigenic structure of PA is not well defined. To identify linear neutralizing epitopes of PA, 145 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the protein were synthesized. Six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antisera from mice specific for PA were tested for their reactivity to the peptides by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Three major linear immunodominant B-cell epitopes were mapped to residues Leu(156) to Ser(170), Val(196) to Ile(210), and Ser(312) to Asn(326) of the PA protein. Two mAbs with toxin-neutralizing activity recognized two different epitopes in close proximity to the furin cleavage site in domain 1. The three-dimensional complex structure of PA and its neutralizing mAbs 7.5G and 19D9 were modeled using the molecular docking method providing models for the interacting epitope and paratope residues. For both mAbs, LeTx neutralization was associated with interference with furin cleavage, but they differed in effectiveness depending on whether they bound on the N- or C-terminal aspect of the cleaved products. The two peptides containing these epitopes that include amino acids Leu(156)-Ser(170) and Val(196)-Ile(210) were immunogenic and elicited neutralizing antibody responses to PA. These results identify the first linear neutralizing epitopes of PA and show that peptides containing epitope sequences can elicit neutralizing antibody responses, a finding that could be exploited for vaccine design."
18218967,1,Eukaryotic Cell,101130731,2009,Role for chitin and chitooligomers in the capsular architecture of Cryptococcus neoformans.,"Molecules composed of beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and deacetylated glucosamine units play key roles as surface constituents of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of chitin and chitooligomers, which participate in the connection of capsular polysaccharides to the cryptococcal cell wall. In the present study, we evaluated the role of GlcNAc-containing structures in the assembly of the cryptococcal capsule. The in vivo expression of chitooligomers in C. neoformans varied depending on the infected tissue, as inferred from the differential reactivity of yeast forms to the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in infected brain and lungs of rats. Chromatographic and dynamic light-scattering analyses demonstrated that glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), the major cryptococcal capsular component, interacts with chitin and chitooligomers. When added to C. neoformans cultures, chitooligomers formed soluble complexes with GXM and interfered in capsular assembly, as manifested by aberrant capsules with defective connections with the cell wall and no reactivity with a monoclonal antibody to GXM. Cultivation of C. neoformans in the presence of an inhibitor of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase resulted in altered expression of cell wall chitin. These cells formed capsules that were loosely connected to the cryptococcal wall and contained fibers with decreased diameters and altered monosaccharide composition. These results contribute to our understanding of the role played by chitin and chitooligosaccharides on the cryptococcal capsular structure, broadening the functional activities attributed to GlcNAc-containing structures in this biological system."
18219272,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Genomic insights into the convergence and pathogenicity factors of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli species.,"Whether or not bacteria form coherent evolutionary groups via means of genetic exchange and, hence, elicit distinct species boundaries remains an unsettled issue. A recent report implied that not only may the former be true but also, in fact, the clearly distinct Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli species may be converging as a consequence of increased interspecies gene flow fostered, presumably, by the recent invasion of an overlapping ecological niche (S. K. Sheppard, N. D. McCarthy, D. Falush, and M. C. Maiden, Science 320:237-239, 2008). We have reanalyzed the Campylobacter multilocus sequence typing database used in the previous study and found that the number of interspecies gene transfer events may actually be too infrequent to account, unequivocally, for species convergence. For instance, only 1 to 2% of the 4,507 Campylobacter isolates examined appeared to have imported gene alleles from another Campylobacter species. Furthermore, by analyzing the available Campylobacter genomic sequences, we show that although there seems to be a slightly higher number of exchanged genes between C. jejuni and C. coli relative to other comparable species ( approximately 10% versus 2 to 3% of the total genes in the genome, respectively), the function and spatial distribution in the genome of the exchanged genes are far from random, and hence, inconsistent with the species convergence hypothesis. In fact, the exchanged genes appear to be limited to a few environmentally selected cellular functions. Accordingly, these genes may represent important pathogenic determinants of pathogenic Campylobacter, and convergence of (any) two bacterial species remains to be seen."

Immunol.,7905289,2009,"Characterisation of purified parvalbumin from five fish species and nucleotide sequencing of this major allergen from Pacific pilchard, Sardinops sagax.","IgE-mediated allergic reaction to seafood is a common cause of food allergy including anaphylactic reactions. Parvalbumin, the major fish allergen, has been shown to display IgE cross-reactivity among fish species consumed predominantly in Europe and the Far East. However, cross-reactivity studies of parvalbumin from fish species widely consumed in the Southern hemisphere are limited as is data relating to immunological and molecular characterisation. In this study, antigenic cross-reactivity and the presence of oligomers and isomers of parvalbumin from five highly consumed fish species in Southern Africa were assessed by immunoblotting using purified parvalbumin and crude fish extracts. Pilchard (Sardinops sagax) parvalbumin was found to display the strongest IgE reactivity among 10 fish-allergic consumers. The cDNA sequence of the beta-form of pilchard parvalbumin was determined and designated Sar sa 1.0101 (accession number FM177701 EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases). Oligomeric forms of parvalbumin were observed in all fish species using a monoclonal anti-parvalbumin antibody and subject's sera. Isoforms varied between approximately 10-13 kDa. A highly cross-reactive allergenic isoform of parvalbumin was identified and sequenced, providing a successful primary step towards the generation of a recombinant form that could be used for diagnostic and potential therapeutic use in allergic individuals."
18230726,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,A large library based on a novel (CH2) scaffold: identification of HIV-1 inhibitors.,"Isolated immunoglobulin CH2 domains were proposed as scaffolds for selection of binders with potential effector functions. We tested the feasibility of this approach by constructing a large (size 5 x 10(10)) library where all amino acids in two loops (BC and FG) were mutated to four residues (Y, A, D, or S). Three binders were selected from this library by panning against a gp120-CD4 complex. The strongest binder, m1a1, recognized specifically a highly conserved CD4i epitope and inhibited to various extents seven out of nine HIV-1 isolates from different clades. The loop BC and the conformational state of the scaffold are critical for its binding. These results provide a proof of concept for the potential of CH2 as a scaffold for construction of libraries containing potentially useful binders. The newly identified HIV-1 inhibitors could be further improved to candidate therapeutics and/or used as research reagents for exploration of conserved gp120 structures."

18230735,1,Biochem. Soc. Trans.,7506897,2009,IGFBP-5 induces epithelial and fibroblast responses consistent with the fibrotic response.,"Fibrosis involves activation of fibroblasts, increased production of collagen and fibronectin and transdifferentiation into contractile myofibroblasts. The process resembles aspects of wound-healing but remains unresolved and can be life-threatening when manifest in the kidneys, lungs and liver, in particular. The causes are largely unknown, but recent suggestions that repetitive micro-injury results in the eventual failure of epithelial cell repair due to replicative senescence are gaining favour. This is consistent with the onset of fibrotic diseases in middle age. Because epithelial injury often involves blood loss, inflammatory responses associated with the fibrotic response have been considered as therapeutic targets. However, this has proved largely unsuccessful and focus is now switching to earlier events in the process. These include EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and fibroblast activation in the absence of inflammation. TGFbeta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) induces both EMT and fibroblast activation and is considered to be a major pro-fibrotic factor. Recently, IGFBP-5 [IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-binding protein-5] has also been shown to induce similar effects on TGFbeta1, and is strongly implicated in the process of senescence. It also stimulates migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, implicating it in the inflammatory response. In this paper, we examine the evidence for a role of IGFBP-5 in fibrosis and highlight its structural relationship with other matrix proteins and growth factors also implicated in tissue remodelling."

The load was varied using different sizes of gold nanorods attached to the rotating gamma subunit and/or by increasing the viscosity of the medium using PEG-400, a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATPase activity. Conditions that increase the duration of the power stroke were found to cause 20-fold increases in the length of the dwell. These results suggest that the order of hydrolysis, product release, and substrate binding may change as the result of external load on the motor or inhibition of hydrolysis."

At the age of 65 years, the patient underwent a cholecystectomy and resection of the liver bed for gallbladder cancer. This was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, with negative resection margins (T2N0M0, stage IB). Nine years later, during a follow-up examination, abdominal computed tomography and MRCP showed an enhanced 1.7 cm mass in the hilum that extended to the second branch of the right intrahepatic bile duct. We diagnosed this lesion as a perihilar bile duct cancer, Bismuth type IIIa, and performed bile duct excision, right hepatic lobectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The histological diagnosis was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with one regional lymph node metastasis (T1N1M0, stage IIB). Twelve months after the second operation, the patient is well, with no signs of recurrence. This case is compared with 11 other cases of metachronous biliary tract cancer published in the world medical literature."

Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Peptic ulcer and childhood adversities experienced by working-aged people.,"AIM: To study the association between self-reported peptic ulcer and childhood adversities. METHODS: The Health and Social Support Study (HeSSup) population consisted of a stratified random sample drawn from the Finnish Population Register in four age groups: 20-24, 30-34, 40-44 and 50-54. The survey was carried out by postal questionnaire during 1998, with a response rate of 40.0%. A follow-up questionnaire was sent during 2003 to all those who responded to the first. Altogether 19,626 individuals returned the follow-up questionnaire; a response rate of 75.8%. The subjects were asked whether a doctor had told them that they have or have had peptic ulcer. The analyses covered those who responded affirmatively to both the baseline and the follow-up enquiries (n = 718). Those not reporting a peptic ulcer in either of the two questionnaires (n = 17,677) were taken as controls. The subjects were further requested (through six questions) to think about their childhood adversities. RESULTS: The most common adversities mentioned were long-lasting financial difficulties in the family, serious conflicts in the family, and a family member seriously or chronically ill. All the adversities reported, except parental divorce, were more common among peptic ulcer patients than among controls (P values varied between &lt; 0.001 and 0.003). Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (OR) of childhood adversities in the multivariate logistic analysis for self-reported peptic ulcer varied between 1.45 and 2.01. Adjusting for smoking, heavy drinking, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use had no further influence (ORs between 1.22 and 1.73). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that childhood adversities maintain a connection with and have a predictive role in the development of peptic ulcer."
18242152,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Outcomes in clinical trials of inhaled corticosteroids for children with asthma are narrowly focussed on short term disease activity.,"BACKGROUND: Little work has been done to determine which outcomes should be measured in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children with asthma. Drug regulatory authorities require that short term disease activity is measured, but other outcome domains are not mandatory for licensing and marketing purposes. We aimed to identify whether any domains were underrepresented in RCTs of regular therapies for children with asthma over a 20 year period, and to examine what consistency there was between RCTs in the outcomes used to assess the domains. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2008, we identified all parallel-group RCTs, published between January 1988 and December 2007, which assessed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as regular therapy for children with asthma. We evaluated how frequently RCTs measured the following pre-defined domains: disease activity; disease damage; functional status; quality of life; health resource utilisation; and adverse effects of therapy. Our initial search identified 1668 abstracts, of which 412 were retrieved in full. 159 RCTs, of which 115 involved only children and 44 involved children and adults, were included in the review. Disease activity was measured in 157 RCTs, adverse effects of ICS in 135, functional status in 25, quality of life in 21, and health resource utilisation in 17. No RCT measured long term disease damage, although two used FEV1 as a measure of 'lung growth'. RCTs were inconsistent in the outcomes used to measure the domains. CONCLUSIONS: Short term disease activity is the most frequently measured outcome domain in RCTs in children with asthma. Effects of regular therapies on functional status, quality of life, and long term consequences of asthma are infrequently assessed. A core set of outcomes, developed using consensus techniques, would standardise the measurement of appropriate outcomes in these RCTs. Involving patients would identify outcomes which are most relevant from their perspective."
18243101,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Mismatch response to polysyllabic nonwords: a neurophysiological signature of language learning capacity.,"BACKGROUND: The ability to repeat polysyllabic nonwords such as &quot;blonterstaping&quot; has frequently been shown to correlate with language learning ability but it is not clear why such a correlation should exist. Three alternative explanations have been offered, stated in terms of differences in: (a) perceptual ability; (b) efficiency of phonological loop functioning; (c) pre-existing vocabulary knowledge and/or articulatory skills. In the present study, we used event-related potentials to assess the contributions from these three factors to explaining individual variation in nonword repetition ability. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 59 adults who were subdivided according to whether they were good or poor nonword-repeaters participated. Electrophysiologically measured mismatch responses were recorded to changes in consonants as participants passively listened to a repeating four syllable CV-string. The consonant change could occur in one of four positions along the CV-string and we predicted that: (a) if nonword repetition depended purely on auditory discrimination ability, then reduced mismatch responses to all four consonant changes would be observed in the poor nonword-repeaters, (b) if it depended on encoding or decay of information in a capacity-limited phonological store, then a position specific decrease in mismatch response would be observed, (c) if neither cognitive capacity was involved, then the two groups of participants would provide equivalent mismatch responses. Consistent with our second hypothesis, a position specific difference located on the third syllable was observed in the late discriminative negativity (LDN) window (230-630 ms post-syllable onset). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data thus confirm that people who are poorer at nonword repetition are less efficient in early processing of polysyllabic speech materials, but this impairment is not attributable to deficits in low level auditory discrimination. We conclude by discussing the significance of the observed relationship between LDN amplitude and nonword repetition ability and describe how this relatively little understood ERP component provides a biological window onto processes required for successful language learning."
18243103,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Phospho-ablated Id2 is growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic in proliferating myoblasts.,"Inhibitor of differentiation protein-2 (Id2) is a dominant negative helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, and a positive regulator of proliferation, in various cells. The N-terminal region of Id2 contains a consensus cdk2 phosphorylation sequence SPVR, which may be involved with the induction of apoptosis, at least in myeloid 32d.3 cells. However, the role of Id2 phosphorylation at serine 5 in skeletal muscle cells is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if the phosphorylation of Id2 at serine 5 alters its cellular localization and its role in apoptosis in C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of wild type Id2 decreased MyoD protein expression, which corresponded to the increased binding of Id2 to basic HLH proteins E47 and E12. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was significantly decreased by the overexpression of phospho-ablated Id2 (S5A); conversely, overexpression of wild type Id2 increased cellular proliferation. The subcellular localization of Id2 and phospho-mimicking Id2 (S5D) were predominantly nuclear compared to S5A. The decreased nuclear localization of S5A corresponded to a decrease in cellular proliferation, and an increase in apoptosis. These data suggest that unphosphorylated Id2 is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it is growth suppressive and potentially pro-apoptotic. These results imply that reducing unphosphorylated Id2 may improve the pool of myoblasts available for differentiation by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis."
18243143,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Structural basis for functional tetramerization of lentiviral integrase.,"Experimental evidence suggests that a tetramer of integrase (IN) is the protagonist of the concerted strand transfer reaction, whereby both ends of retroviral DNA are inserted into a host cell chromosome. Herein we present two crystal structures containing the N-terminal and the catalytic core domains of maedi-visna virus IN in complex with the IN binding domain of the common lentiviral integration co-factor LEDGF. The structures reveal that the dimer-of-dimers architecture of the IN tetramer is stabilized by swapping N-terminal domains between the inner pair of monomers poised to execute catalytic function. Comparison of four independent IN tetramers in our crystal structures elucidate the basis for the closure of the highly flexible dimer-dimer interface, allowing us to model how a pair of active sites become situated for concerted integration. Using a range of complementary approaches, we demonstrate that the dimer-dimer interface is essential for HIV-1 IN tetramerization, concerted integration in vitro, and virus infectivity. Our structures moreover highlight adaptable changes at the interfaces of individual IN dimers that allow divergent lentiviruses to utilize a highly-conserved, common integration co-factor."
18245485,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Programmed cellular necrosis mediated by the pore-forming alpha-toxin from Clostridium septicum.,"Programmed necrosis is a mechanism of cell death that has been described for neuronal excitotoxicity and ischemia/reperfusion injury, but has not been extensively studied in the context of exposure to bacterial exotoxins. The alpha-toxin of Clostridium septicum is a beta-barrel pore-forming toxin and a potent cytotoxin; however, the mechanism by which it induces cell death has not been elucidated in detail. We report that alpha-toxin formed Ca(2+)-permeable pores in murine myoblast cells, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. This Ca(2+) influx did not induce apoptosis, as has been described for other small pore-forming toxins, but a cascade of events consistent with programmed necrosis. Ca(2+) influx was associated with calpain activation and release of cathepsins from lysosomes. We also observed deregulation of mitochondrial activity, leading to increased ROS levels, and dramatically reduced levels of ATP. Finally, the immunostimulatory histone binding protein HMGB1 was found to be released from the nuclei of alpha-toxin-treated cells. Collectively, these data show that alpha-toxin initiates a multifaceted necrotic cell death response that is consistent with its essential role in C. septicum-mediated myonecrosis and sepsis. We postulate that cellular intoxication with pore-forming toxins may be a major mechanism by which programmed necrosis is induced."

We sought genetic variants underlying blood pressure (BP) by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among African Americans, a population group in the United States that is disproportionately affected by hypertension and associated complications, including stroke and kidney diseases. Using a dense panel of over 800,000 SNPs in a discovery sample of 1,017 African Americans from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region, we identified multiple SNPs reaching genome-wide significance for systolic BP in or near the genes: PMS1, SLC24A4, YWHA7, IPO7, and CACANA1H. Two of these genes, SLC24A4 (a sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger) and CACNA1H (a voltage-dependent calcium channel), are potential candidate genes for BP regulation and the latter is a drug target for a class of calcium channel blockers. No variant reached genome wide significance for association with diastolic BP (top scoring SNP rs1867226, p = 5.8 x 10(-7)) or with hypertension as a binary trait (top scoring SNP rs9791170, p = 5.1 x 10(-7)). We replicated some of the significant SNPs in a sample of West Africans. Pathway analysis revealed that genes harboring top-scoring variants cluster in pathways and networks of biologic relevance to hypertension and BP regulation. This is the first GWAS for hypertension and BP in an African American population. The findings suggests that, in addition to or in lieu of relying solely on replicated variants of moderate-to-large effect reaching genome-wide significance, pathway and network approaches may be useful in identifying and prioritizing candidate genes/loci for further experiments."
18250300,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Insights into SAGA function during gene expression.,"Histone modifications are a crucial source of epigenetic control. SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) is a chromatin-modifying complex that contains two distinct enzymatic activities, Gcn5 and Ubp8, through which it acetylates and deubiquitinates histone residues, respectively, thereby enforcing a pattern of modifications that is decisive in regulating gene expression. Here, I discuss the latest contributions to understanding the roles of the SAGA complex, highlighting the characterization of the SAGA-deubiquitination module, and emphasizing the functions newly ascribed to SAGA during transcription elongation and messenger-RNA export. These findings suggest that a crosstalk exists between chromatin remodelling, transcription and messenger-RNA export, which could constitute a checkpoint for accurate gene expression. I focus particularly on the new components of human SAGA, which was recently discovered and confirms the conservation of the SAGA complex throughout evolution."
18250304,1,Science,404511,2009,The human SepSecS-tRNASec complex reveals the mechanism of selenocysteine formation.,"Selenocysteine is the only genetically encoded amino acid in humans whose biosynthesis occurs on its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). O-Phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase (SepSecS) catalyzes the final step of selenocysteine formation by a poorly understood tRNA-dependent mechanism. The crystal structure of human tRNA(Sec) in complex with SepSecS, phosphoserine, and thiophosphate, together with in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays, supports a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent mechanism of Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation. Two tRNA(Sec) molecules, with a fold distinct from other canonical tRNAs, bind to each SepSecS tetramer through their 13-base pair acceptor-TPsiC arm (where Psi indicates pseudouridine). The tRNA binding is likely to induce a conformational change in the enzyme's active site that allows a phosphoserine covalently attached to tRNA(Sec), but not free phosphoserine, to be oriented properly for the reaction to occur."
18250306,1,Science,404511,2009,Transient simulation of last deglaciation with a new mechanism for Bolling-Allerod warming.,"We conducted the first synchronously coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Bølling-Allerød (BA) warming. Our model reproduces several major features of the deglacial climate evolution, suggesting a good agreement in climate sensitivity between the model and observations. In particular, our model simulates the abrupt BA warming as a transient response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to a sudden termination of freshwater discharge to the North Atlantic before the BA. In contrast to previous mechanisms that invoke AMOC multiple equilibrium and Southern Hemisphere climate forcing, we propose that the BA transition is caused by the superposition of climatic responses to the transient CO(2) forcing, the AMOC recovery from Heinrich Event 1, and an AMOC overshoot."
18250317,1,Science,404511,2009,Higher-order photon bunching in a semiconductor microcavity.,"Quantum mechanically indistinguishable particles such as photons may show collective behavior. Therefore, an appropriate description of a light field must consider the properties of an assembly of photons instead of independent particles. We have studied multiphoton correlations up to fourth order in the single-mode emission of a semiconductor microcavity in the weak and strong coupling regimes. The counting statistics of single photons were recorded with picosecond time resolution, allowing quantitative measurement of the few-photon bunching inside light pulses. Our results show bunching behavior in the strong coupling case, which vanishes in the weak coupling regime as the cavity starts lasing. In particular, we verify the n factorial prediction for the zero-delay correlation function of n thermal light photons."
18250328,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Steric and electrostatic effects at the C2 atom substituent influence replication and miscoding of the DNA deamination product deoxyxanthosine and analogs by DNA polymerases.,"Deoxyinosine (dI) and deoxyxanthosine (dX) are both formed in DNA at appreciable levels in vivo by deamination of deoxyadenosine (dA) and deoxyguanosine (dG), respectively, and can miscode. Structure-activity relationships for dA pairing have been examined extensively using analogs but relatively few studies have probed the roles of the individual hydrogen-bonding atoms of dG in DNA replication. The replicative bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase/exonuclease and the translesion DNA polymerase Sulfolobus solfataricus pol IV were used as models to discern the mechanisms of miscoding by DNA polymerases. Removal of the 2-amino group from the template dG (i.e., dI) had little impact on the catalytic efficiency of either polymerase, as judged by either steady-state or pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, although the misincorporation frequency was increased by an order of magnitude. dX was highly miscoding with both polymerases, and incorporation of several bases was observed. The addition of an electronegative fluorine atom at the 2-position of dI lowered the oligonucleotide T(m) and strongly inhibited incorporation of dCTP. The addition of bromine or oxygen (dX) at C2 lowered the T(m) further, strongly inhibited both polymerases, and increased the frequency of misincorporation. Linear activity models show the effects of oxygen (dX) and the halogens at C2 on both DNA polymerases as mainly due to a combination of both steric and electrostatic factors, producing a clash with the paired cytosine O2 atom, as opposed to either bulk or perturbation of purine ring electron density alone."
18250332,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Translocation of H-Ras and its implications in the development of diabetic retinopathy.,"H-Ras, a small molecular weight G-protein, undergoes post-translational modifications enabling its translocation from cytosol to the membrane. Hyperglycemia increases apoptosis of retinal capillary cells via activation of H-Ras, which can be ameliorated by farnesylation inhibitors. Our aim is to investigate the mechanism of retinal H-Ras activation in diabetes. H-Ras and Raf-1 were quantified in the retinal membrane and cytosol fractions obtained from streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats, and the role of post-translation modification was determined by investigating the effect of simvastatin on diabetes-induced alterations. The effect of H-Ras-siRNA on membrane translocation and apoptosis was also determined in bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs). Diabetes increased expressions of H-Ras and Raf-1 in the retinal membranes, and simvastatin prevented such translocation. Glucose-exposure of BRECs increased membrane H-Ras expression and H-Ras-siRNA prevented this translocation, and also decreased their apoptosis. Thus, membrane translocation of H-Ras is a plausible mechanism responsible for accelerated apoptosis of retinal capillary cells in diabetes."
18250335,1,BMC Cell Biol.,100966972,2009,Evaluation of expression and function of the H+/myo-inositol transporter HMIT.,"BACKGROUND: The phosphoinositide (PIns) signalling pathway regulates a series of neuronal processes, such as neurotransmitter release, that are thought to be altered in mood disorders. Furthermore, mood-stabilising drugs have been shown to inhibit key enzymes that regulate PIns production and alter neuronal growth cone morphology in an inositol-reversible manner. Here, we describe analyses of expression and function of the recently identified H+/myo-inositol transporter (HMIT) investigated as a potential regulator of PIns signalling. RESULTS: We show that HMIT is primarily a neuronal transporter widely expressed in the rat and human brain, with particularly high levels in the hippocampus and cortex, as shown by immunohistochemistry. The transporter is localised at the Golgi apparatus in primary cultured neurones. No HMIT-mediated electrophysiological responses were detected in rat brain neurones or slices; in addition, inositol transport and homeostasis were unaffected in HMIT targeted null-mutant mice. CONCLUSION: Together, these data do not support a role for HMIT as a neuronal plasma membrane inositol transporter, as previously proposed. However, we observed that HMIT can transport inositol triphosphate, indicating unanticipated intracellular functions for this transporter that may be relevant to mood control."
18252829,1,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,"A method for identifying alternative or cryptic donor splice sites within gene and mRNA sequences. Comparisons among sequences from vertebrates, echinoderms and other groups.","BACKGROUND: As the amount of genome sequencing data grows, so does the problem of computational gene identification, and in particular, the splicing signals that flank exon borders. Traditional methods for identifying splicing signals have been created and optimized using sequences from model organisms, mostly vertebrate and yeast species. However, as genome sequencing extends across the animal kingdom and includes various invertebrate species, the need for mechanisms to recognize splice signals in these organisms increases as well. With that aim in mind, we generated a model for identifying donor and acceptor splice sites that was optimized using sequences from the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. This model was then used to assess the possibility of alternative or cryptic splicing within the highly variable immune response gene family known as 185/333. RESULTS: A donor splice site model was generated from S. purpuratus sequences that incorporates non-adjacent dependences among positions within the 9 nt splice signal and uses position weight matrices to determine the probability that the site is used for splicing. The Purpuratus model was shown to predict splice signals better than a similar model created from vertebrate sequences. Although the Purpuratus model was able to correctly predict the true splice sites within the 185/333 genes, no evidence for alternative or trans-gene splicing was observed. CONCLUSION: The data presented herein describe the first published analyses of echinoderm splice sites and suggest that the previous methods of identifying splice signals that are based largely on vertebrate sequences may be insufficient. Furthermore, alternative or trans-gene splicing does not appear to be acting as a diversification mechanism in the 185/333 gene family."
18256029,1,J. Med. Chem.,9716531,2009,Synthesis and antiprotozoal activity of pyridyl analogues of pentamidine.,"A series of novel pyridyl analogues 1-18 of antiprotozoal drug 1,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)pentane (pentamidine) has been synthesized and tested for in vitro activities against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Plasmodium falciparum, and Leishmania donovani, and for cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Antiprotozoal properties of compounds 1-18 depended on the placement of cationic moieties on the pyridine rings as well as the nature of substituents on the amidine groups. Diamidine 6 with cationic moieties adjacent to pyridine nitrogen atoms was the most promising compound in the series showing superior in vitro activities against T. brucei rhodesiense, P. falciparum, and L. donovani compared to pentamidine. An oral prodrug of diamidine 6, diamidoxime 9, administered at 25 mg/kg daily for 4 days, exhibited excellent antitrypanosomal efficacy in vivo curing all infected animals in the STIB900 acute mouse model of trypanosomiasis."
18256687,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Two secondary carbohydrate binding sites on the surface of barley alpha-amylase 1 have distinct functions and display synergy in hydrolysis of starch granules.,"Some polysaccharide processing enzymes possess secondary carbohydrate binding sites situated on the surface far from the active site. In barley alpha-amylase 1 (AMY1), two such sites, SBS1 and SBS2, are found on the catalytic (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel and the noncatalytic C-terminal domain, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp(278) and Trp(279), stacking onto adjacent ligand glucosyl residues at SBS1, and of Tyr(380) and His(395), making numerous ligand contacts at SBS2, suggested that SBS1 and SBS2 act synergistically in degradation of starch granules. While SBS1 makes the major contribution to binding and hydrolysis of starch granules, SBS2 exhibits a higher affinity for the starch mimic beta-cyclodextrin. Compared to that of wild-type AMY1, the K(d) of starch granule binding by the SBS1 W278A, W279A, and W278A/W279A mutants thus increased 15-35 times; furthermore, the k(cat)/K(m) of W278A/W279A was 2%, whereas both affinity and activity for Y380A at SBS2 were 10% of the wild-type values. Dual site double and triple SBS1/SBS2 substitutions eliminated binding to starch granules, and the k(cat)/K(m) of W278A/W279A/Y380A AMY1 was only 0.4% of the wild-type value. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of mutants showed that beta-cyclodextrin binds to SBS2 and SBS1 with K(d,1) and K(d,2) values of 0.07 and 1.40 mM, respectively. A model that accounts for the observed synergy in starch hydrolysis, where SBS1 and SBS2 bind ordered and free alpha-glucan chains, respectively, thus targeting the enzyme to single alpha-glucan chains accessible for hydrolysis, is proposed. SBS1 and SBS2 also influence the kinetics of hydrolysis for amylose and maltooligosaccharides, the degree of multiple attack on amylose, and subsite binding energies."
18256688,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Lack of cross-scale linkages reduces robustness of community-based fisheries management.,"Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997-2001), during (2002) and after (2003-2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in &gt;100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives."
18256700,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Intracellular receptor for human host defense peptide LL-37 in monocytes.,"The human cationic host defense peptide LL-37 has a broad range of immunomodulatory, anti-infective functions. A synthetic innate defense regulator peptide, innate defense regulator 1 (IDR-1), based conceptually on LL-37, was recently shown to selectively modulate innate immunity to protect against a wide range of bacterial infections. Using advanced proteomic techniques, ELISA, and Western blotting procedures, GAPDH was identified as a direct binding partner for LL-37 in monocytes. Enzyme kinetics and mobility shift studies also indicated LL-37 and IDR-1 binding to GAPDH. The functional relevance of GAPDH in peptide-induced responses was demonstrated by using gene silencing of GAPDH with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Previous studies have established that the induction of chemokines and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are critical immunomodulatory functions in the anti-infective properties of LL-37 and IDR-1, and these functions are modulated by the MAPK p38 pathway. Consistent with that, this study demonstrated the importance of the GAPDH interactions with these peptides since gene silencing of GAPDH resulted in impaired p38 MAPK signaling, downstream chemokine and cytokine transcriptional responses induced by LL-37 and IDR-1, and LL-37-induced cytokine production. Bioinformatic analysis, using InnateDB, of the major interacting partners of GAPDH indicated the likelihood that this protein can impact on innate immune pathways including p38 MAPK. Thus, this study has demonstrated a novel function for GAPDH as a mononuclear cell receptor for human cathelicidin LL-37 and immunomodulatory IDR-1 and conclusively demonstrated its relevance in the functioning of cationic host defense peptides."
18259216,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,BDNF-mediated cerebellar granule cell development is impaired in mice null for CaMKK2 or CaMKIV.,"The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-activated kinases CaMKK2 and CaMKIV are highly expressed in the brain where they play important roles in activating intracellular responses to elevated Ca(2+). To address the biological functions of Ca(2+) signaling via these kinases during brain development, we have examined cerebellar development in mice null for CaMKK2 or CaMKIV. Here, we demonstrate that CaMKK2/CaMKIV-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) correlates with Bdnf transcription, which is required for normal development of cerebellar granule cell neurons. We show in vivo and in vitro that the absence of either CaMKK2 or CaMKIV disrupts the ability of developing cerebellar granule cells in the external granule cell layer to cease proliferation and begin migration to the internal granule cell layer. Furthermore, loss of CaMKK2 or CaMKIV results in decreased CREB phosphorylation (pCREB), Bdnf exon I and IV-containing mRNAs, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in cerebellar granule cell neurons. Reexpression of CaMKK2 or CaMKIV in granule cells that lack CaMKK2 or CaMKIV, respectively, restores pCREB and BDNF to wild-type levels and addition of BDNF rescues granule cell migration in vitro. These results reveal a previously undefined role for a CaMKK2/CaMKIV cascade involved in cerebellar granule cell development and show specifically that Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of BDNF through CaMKK2/CaMKIV is required for this process."
18267069,1,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Role of pendrin in iodide balance: going with the flow.,"Pendrin is expressed in the apical regions of type B and non-A, non-B intercalated cells, where it mediates Cl(-) absorption and HCO3(-) secretion through apical Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchange. Since pendrin is a robust I(-) transporter, we asked whether pendrin is upregulated with dietary I(-) restriction and whether it modulates I(-) balance. Thus I(-) balance was determined in pendrin null and in wild-type mice. Pendrin abundance was evaluated with immunoblots, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold cytochemistry with morphometric analysis. While pendrin abundance was unchanged when dietary I(-) intake was varied over the physiological range, I(-) balance differed in pendrin null and in wild-type mice. Serum I(-) was lower, while I(-) excretion was higher in pendrin null relative to wild-type mice, consistent with a role of pendrin in renal I(-) absorption. Increased H2O intake enhanced differences between wild-type and pendrin null mice in I(-) balance, suggesting that H2O intake modulates pendrin abundance. Raising water intake from approximately 4 to approximately 11 ml/day increased the ratio of B cell apical plasma membrane to cytoplasm pendrin label by 75%, although circulating renin, aldosterone, and serum osmolality were unchanged. Further studies asked whether H2O intake modulates pendrin through the action of AVP. We observed that H2O intake modulated pendrin abundance even when circulating vasopressin levels were clamped. We conclude that H2O intake modulates pendrin abundance, although not likely through a direct, type 2 vasopressin receptor-dependent mechanism. As water intake rises, pendrin becomes increasingly critical in the maintenance of Cl(-) and I(-) balance."
18267075,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Artificial transmembrane oncoproteins smaller than the bovine papillomavirus E5 protein redefine sequence requirements for activation of the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor.,"The bovine papillomavirus E5 protein (BPV E5) is a 44-amino-acid homodimeric transmembrane protein that binds directly to the transmembrane domain of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor and induces ligand-independent receptor activation. Three specific features of BPV E5 are considered important for its ability to activate the PDGF beta receptor and transform mouse fibroblasts: a pair of C-terminal cysteines, a transmembrane glutamine, and a juxtamembrane aspartic acid. By using a new genetic technique to screen libraries expressing artificial transmembrane proteins for activators of the PDGF beta receptor, we isolated much smaller proteins, from 32 to 36 residues, that lack all three of these features yet still dimerize noncovalently, specifically activate the PDGF beta receptor via its transmembrane domain, and transform cells efficiently. The primary amino acid sequence of BPV E5 is virtually unrecognizable in some of these proteins, which share as few as seven consecutive amino acids with the viral protein. Thus, small artificial proteins that bear little resemblance to a viral oncoprotein can nevertheless productively interact with the same cellular target. We speculate that similar cellular proteins may exist but have been overlooked due to their small size and hydrophobicity."
18268325,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Interactions between viral and prokaryotic pathogens in a mixed infection with cardiovirus and mycoplasma.,"In the natural environment, animal and plant viruses often share ecological niches with microorganisms, but the interactions between these pathogens, although potentially having important implications, are poorly investigated. The present report demonstrates, in a model system, profound mutual effects of mycoplasma and cardioviruses in animal cell cultures. In contrast to mycoplasma-free cells, cultures contaminated with Mycoplasma hyorhinis responded to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus, but not with poliovirus (also a picornavirus), with a strong activation of a DNase(s), as evidenced by the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) immunofluorescence assay and electrophoretic analysis of host DNA. This degradation was reminiscent of that observed upon apoptosis but was caspase independent, judging by the failure of the specific pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh to prevent it. The electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme responsible for DNA degradation and dependence of its activity on ionic conditions strongly suggested that it was represented by a DNase(s) of mycoplasma origin. In cells not infected with EMCV, the relevant DNase was dormant. The possibility is discussed that activation of the mycoplasma DNase might be linked to a relatively early increase in permeability of plasma membrane of the infected cells caused by EMCV. This type of unanticipated virus-mycoplasma &quot;cooperation&quot; may exemplify the complexity of pathogen-host interactions under conditions when viruses and microorganisms are infecting the same host. In the course of the present study, it was also demonstrated that pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD(OMe).fmk strongly suppressed cardiovirus polyprotein processing, illustrating an additional pitfall in investigations of viral effects on the apoptotic system of host cells."
18268334,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,HSSB1 and hSSB2 form similar multiprotein complexes that participate in DNA damage response.,"hSSB1 (human single strand DNA-binding protein 1) has been shown to participate in homologous recombination (HR)-dependent repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-mediated checkpoint pathways. Here we present evidence that hSSB2, a homolog of hSSB1, plays a role similar to hSSB1 in DNA damage-response pathways. This was evidenced by findings that hSSB2-depleted cells resemble hSSB1-depleted cells in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents, reduced efficiency in HR-dependent repair of DSBs, and defective ATM-dependent phosphorylation. Notably, hSSB1 and hSSB2 form separate complexes with two identical proteins, INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (C9ORF80). Cells depleted of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 also exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents, chromosomal instability, and reduced ATM-dependent phosphorylation. hSSBIP1 was rapidly recruited to laser-induced DSBs, a feature also similar to that reported for hSSB1. Depletion of INTS3 decreased the stability of hSSB1 and hSSBIP1, suggesting that INTS3 may provide a scaffold to allow proper assembly of the hSSB complexes. Thus, our data demonstrate that hSSB1 and hSSB2 form two separate complexes with similar structures, and both are required for efficient HR-dependent repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent signaling pathways."
18268343,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Phosphorylated intrinsically disordered region of FACT masks its nucleosomal DNA binding elements.,"FACT is a heterodimer of SPT16 and SSRP1, which each contain several conserved regions in the primary structure. The interaction of FACT with nucleosomes induces chromatin remodeling through the combinatorial action of its distinct functional protein regions. However, there is little mechanistic insight into how these regions cooperatively contribute to FACT functions, particularly regarding the recognition of nucleosomal DNA. Here, we report the identification of novel phosphorylation sites of Drosophila melanogaster FACT (dFACT) expressed in Sf9 cells. These sites are densely concentrated in the acidic intrinsically disordered (ID) region of the SSRP1 subunit and control nucleosomal DNA binding by dFACT. This region and the adjacent segment of the HMG domain form weak electrostatic intramolecular interactions, which is reinforced by the phosphorylation, thereby blocking DNA binding competitively. Importantly, this control mechanism appears to support rapid chromatin transactions during early embryogenesis through the dephosphorylation of some sites in the maternally transmitted dSSRP1."
18268347,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,A comprehensive analysis of the structure-function relationship in proteins based on local structure similarity.,"BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity to characterized proteins provides testable functional hypotheses for less than 50% of the proteins identified by genome sequencing projects. With structural genomics it is believed that structural similarities may give functional hypotheses for many of the remaining proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We provide a systematic analysis of the structure-function relationship in proteins using the novel concept of local descriptors of protein structure. A local descriptor is a small substructure of a protein which includes both short- and long-range interactions. We employ a library of commonly reoccurring local descriptors general enough to assemble most existing protein structures. We then model the relationship between these local shapes and Gene Ontology using rule-based learning. Our IF-THEN rule model offers legible, high resolution descriptions that combine local substructures and is able to discriminate functions even for functionally versatile folds such as the frequently occurring TIM barrel and Rossmann fold. By evaluating the predictive performance of the model, we provide a comprehensive quantification of the structure-function relationship based only on local structure similarity. Our findings are, among others, that conserved structure is a stronger prerequisite for enzymatic activity than for binding specificity, and that structure-based predictions complement sequence-based predictions. The model is capable of generating correct hypotheses, as confirmed by a literature study, even when no significant sequence similarity to characterized proteins exists. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our approach offers a new and complete description and quantification of the structure-function relationship in proteins. By demonstrating how our predictions offer higher sensitivity than using global structure, and complement the use of sequence, we show that the presented ideas could advance the development of meta-servers in function prediction."

It has a rapid turnover, and its content is subject to large fluctuations due to physiological and environmental conditions, with the strongest effects mediated by EGFR signaling. Using an elegant organotypic culture system, Monslow et al. (2009, this issue) demonstrate that heparin-binding (HB)-EGF released from its membrane anchor is the major ligand of EGFR in injured epidermis, accounting for the autocrine and paracrine activation of hyaluronan synthesis by the keratinocytes in the neighborhood, thus facilitating the epidermal wound-healing response."

Cancer,370635,2009,High expression of HSP47 in ulcerative colitis-associated carcinomas: proteomic approach.,"BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, known to be associated with a markedly increased risk of colorectal carcinoma development. METHODS: Using proteomic analysis with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, differentially expressed proteins were assessed between UC-associated cancer and sporadic colon cancer cell lines. Western blot and immunostaining were performed for confirming the expression. RESULTS: Heat-shock protein of 47 kDa (HSP47) was identified as one of the proteins expressed more highly in UC-associated cancer cell lines, and an immunohistochemical examination confirmed significantly higher levels of HSP47 in UC-associated colon cancers than in sporadic counterparts, the expression increasing with a progression of neoplastic lesions. Heat-shock protein of 47 kDa was further found to be coexpressed with type I collagen in the cytoplasm, and both HSP47 and type I collagen were released from cultured cells into the culture medium. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that overexpression of HSP47 is a unique characteristic of UC-associated carcinoma related to type I collagen synthesis, with possible clinical applications."

These represent segments of the Brassica A genome as found in Brassica rapa and Brassica napus and the corresponding segments of the Brassica C genome as found in Brassica oleracea and B. napus. Analysis of synonymous base substitution rates within modeled genes revealed a relatively broad range of times (0.12 to 1.37 million years ago) since the divergence of orthologous genome segments as represented in B. napus and the diploid species. Similar, and consistent, ranges were also identified for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion-deletion variation. Genes conserved across the Brassica genomes and the homoeologous segments of the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana showed almost perfect collinearity. Numerous examples of apparent transduplication of gene fragments, as previously reported in B. oleracea, were observed in B. rapa and B. napus, indicating that this phenomenon is widespread in Brassica species. In the majority of the regions studied, the C genome segments were expanded in size relative to their A genome counterparts. The considerable variation that we observed, even between the different versions of the same Brassica genome, for gene fragments and annotated putative genes suggest that the concept of the pan-genome might be particularly appropriate when considering Brassica genomes."

18272596,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Formation of protocell-like vesicles in a thermal diffusion column.,"Many of the properties of bilayer membranes composed of simple single-chain amphiphiles seem to be well-suited for a potential role as primitive cell membranes. However, the spontaneous formation of membranes from such amphiphiles is a concentration-dependent process in which a significant critical aggregate concentration (cac) must be reached. Since most scenarios for the prebiotic synthesis of fatty acids and related amphiphiles would result in dilute solutions well below the cac, the identification of mechanisms that would lead to increased local amphiphile concentrations is an important aspect of defining reasonable conditions for the origin of cellular life. Narrow, vertically oriented channels within the mineral precipitates of hydrothermal vent towers have previously been proposed to act as natural Clusius-Dickel thermal diffusion columns, in which a strong transverse thermal gradient concentrates dilute molecules through the coupling of thermophoresis and convection. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a microcapillary acting as a thermal diffusion column can concentrate a solution of oleic acid. Upon concentration, self-assembly of large vesicles occurs in regions where the cac is exceeded. We detected vesicle formation by fluorescence microscopy of encapsulated dye cargoes, which simultaneously concentrated in our channels. Our findings suggest a novel means by which simple physical processes could have led to the spontaneous formation of cell-like structures from a dilute prebiotic reservoir."
18273060,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Isolated seven-coordinate Ru(IV) dimer complex with [HOHOH](-) bridging ligand as an intermediate for catalytic water oxidation.,"With the inspiration from an oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in Photosystem II (PSII), a mononuclear Ru(II) complex with a tetradentate ligand containing two carboxylate groups has been synthesized and structurally characterized. This Ru(II) complex showed efficient catalytic properties toward water oxidation by the chemical oxidant cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. During the process of catalytic water oxidation, Ru(III) and Ru(IV) species have been successfully isolated as intermediates. To our surprise, X-ray crystallography together with HR-MS revealed that the Ru(IV) species is a seven-coordinate Ru(IV) dimer complex containing a [HOHOH](-) bridging ligand. This bridging ligand has a short O...O distance and is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules. The discovery of this very uncommon seven-coordinate Ru(IV) dimer together with a hydrogen bonding network may contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism for catalytic water oxidation. It will also provide new possibilities for the design of more efficient catalysts for water oxidation, which is the key step for solar energy conversion into hydrogen by light-driven water splitting, the ultimate challenge in artificial photosynthesis."
18273061,1,Nat. Med.,9502015,2009,Imaging transforming growth factor-beta signaling dynamics and therapeutic response in breast cancer bone metastasis.,"Although the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, its in vivo dynamics and temporal-spatial involvement in organ-specific metastasis have not been investigated. Here we engineered a xenograft model system with a conditional control of the TGF-beta-SMAD signaling pathway and a dual-luciferase reporter system for tracing both metastatic burden and TGF-beta signaling activity in vivo. Strong TGF-beta signaling in osteolytic bone lesions is suppressed directly by genetic and pharmacological disruption of the TGF-beta-SMAD pathway and indirectly by inhibition of osteoclast function with bisphosphonates. Notably, disruption of TGF-beta signaling early in metastasis can substantially reduce metastasis burden but becomes less effective when bone lesions are well established. Our in vivo system for real-time manipulation and detection of TGF-beta signaling provides a proof of principle for using similar strategies to analyze the in vivo dynamics of other metastasis-associated signaling pathways and will expedite the development and characterization of therapeutic agents."
18273062,1,Cell Cycle,101137841,2009,Divergent transcription: a new feature of active promoters.,Divergent transcription is common of many promoters in organisms as diverse as mammals and yeast. Many independent experiments indicate that RNA polymerase II is frequently initiated but paused in the sense direction downstream from the promoter. Similarly a second peak of transcriptionally-engaged polymerase is paused in the anti-sense direction upstream of the promoter. Chromatin modifications that are associated with active promoters reside in nucleosomes immediately flanking this pair of paused polymerases. The nucleosome-free region associated with most promoters could in part be defined by this divergent transcription. The potential implications of divergent transcription on gene regulation and possible mechanisms that give rise to this phenomenon are discussed.
18274552,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,"S region sequence, RNA polymerase II, and histone modifications create chromatin accessibility during class switch recombination.","Immunoglobulin class switch recombination is governed by long-range interactions between enhancers and germline transcript promoters to activate transcription and modulate chromatin accessibility to activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). However, mechanisms leading to the differential targeting of AID to switch (S) regions but not to constant (C(H)) regions remain unclear. We show that S and C(H) regions are dynamically modified with histone marks that are associated with active and repressed chromatin states, respectively. Chromatin accessibility is superimposable with the activating histone modifications, which extend throughout S regions irrespective of length. High density elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is detected in S regions, suggesting that the transcription machinery has paused and stalling is abolished by deletion of the S region. We propose that RNAP II enrichment facilitates recruitment of histone modifiers to generate accessibility. Thus, the histone methylation pattern produced by transcription localizes accessible chromatin to S regions, thereby focusing AID attack."
18275811,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,Group B Streptococcus suppression of phagocyte functions by protein-mediated engagement of human Siglec-5.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of invasive bacterial infections in human newborns. A key GBS virulence factor is its capsular polysaccharide (CPS), displaying terminal sialic acid (Sia) residues which block deposition and activation of complement on the bacterial surface. We recently demonstrated that GBS Sia can bind human CD33-related Sia-recognizing immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily lectins (hCD33rSiglecs), a family of inhibitory receptors expressed on the surface of leukocytes. We report the unexpected discovery that certain GBS strains may bind one such receptor, hSiglec-5, in a Sia-independent manner, via the cell wall-anchored beta protein, resulting in recruitment of SHP protein tyrosine phosphatases. Using a panel of WT and mutant GBS strains together with Siglec-expressing cells and soluble Siglec-Fc chimeras, we show that GBS beta protein binding to Siglec-5 functions to impair human leukocyte phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and extracellular trap production, promoting bacterial survival. We conclude that protein-mediated functional engagement of an inhibitory host lectin receptor promotes bacterial innate immune evasion."
18275821,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Nicotiana tabacum TTG1 contributes to ParA1-induced signalling and cell death in leaf trichomes.,"Leaf trichomes serve as a physical barrier and can also secrete antimicrobial compounds to protect plants from attacks by insects and pathogens. Besides the use of the physical and chemical mechanisms, leaf trichomes might also support plant responses by communicating the extrinsic cues to plant intrinsic signalling pathways. Here we report a role of leaf trichomes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) hypersensitive cell death (HCD) induced by ParA1, an elicitin protein from a plant-pathogenic oomycete. After localized treatment with ParA1, reactive oxygen species were produced first in the leaf trichomes and then in mesophylls. Reactive oxygen species are a group of intracellular signals that are crucial for HCD to develop and for cells to undergo cell death subsequent to chromatin condensation, a hallmark of HCD. These events were impaired when the production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was inhibited by catalase or a NADPH-oxidase inhibitor applied to trichomes, suggesting the importance of H(2)O(2) in the pathway of HCD signal transduction from the trichomes to mesophylls. This pathway was no longer activated when leaf trichomes were treated with C51S, a ParA1 mutant protein defective in its interaction with N. tabacum TTG1 (NtTTG1), which is a trichome protein that binds ParA1, rather than C51S, in vitro and in trichome cells. The ParA1-NtTTG1 interaction and the HCD pathway were also abrogated when NtTTG1 was silenced in the trichomes. These observations suggest that NtTTG1 plays an essential role in HCD signal transduction from leaf trichomes to mesophylls."

Commun.,372516,2009,"HDAC inhibitors, MS275 and SBHA, enhances cytotoxicity induced by oxaliplatin in the colorectal cancer cell lines.","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by catalyzing the removal of acetyl groups, stimulating chromatin condensation, and promoting transcriptional repression. Since aberrant epigenetic changes are a hallmark of cancer, HDACs appear a promising target for pharmacological inhibition. To test this we have addressed the hypothesis that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), MS275 and SBHA, potentiate inhibitory effects of classical anti-colorectal cancer cytostatic, oxaliplatin, on survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro. We are reporting here that HDACi shows potent synergistic interaction with oxaliplatin. The observed synergism between HDACi and oxaliplatin is most probably related to the augmented apoptotic signal and allowed for significant reduction of doses of anticancer agents used."

Here, we identify BTBD12 as the human ortholog of the budding yeast DNA repair factor Slx4p and D. melanogaster MUS312. Human SLX4 forms a multiprotein complex with the ERCC4(XPF)-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1 endonucleases and also associates with MSH2/MSH3 mismatch repair complex, telomere binding complex TERF2(TRF2)-TERF2IP(RAP1), the protein kinase PLK1 and the uncharacterized protein C20orf94. Depletion of SLX4 causes sensitivity to mitomycin C and camptothecin and reduces the efficiency of DSB repair in vivo. SLX4 complexes cleave 3' flap, 5' flap, and replication fork structures; yet unlike other endonucleases associated with SLX4, the SLX1-SLX4 module promotes symmetrical cleavage of static and migrating Holliday junctions (HJs), identifying SLX1-SLX4 as a HJ resolvase. Thus, SLX4 assembles a modular toolkit for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and is critical for cellular responses to replication fork failure."

18287022,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Octanuclear copper(I) clusters inscribed in a Se(12) icosahedron: anion-induced modulation of the core size and symmetry.,"Synthesis and structural characterization of an octanuclear Cu(I) cluster [Cu(8){Se(2)P(O(i)Pr)(2)}(6)](PF(6))(2) (1) with an empty Cu(8) cubic core involving diisopropyl diselenophosphate (dsep) ligand has been demonstrated despite its high tendency to abstract anions even from the traces of impurities in the solvent. Reaction of 1 with anion sources (Bu(4)NF for F(-); NaBH(4) for H(-), and NaSH for S(2-)) in a 1:1 ratio produced anion-centered Cu(8) clusters with a formula [Cu(8)(X){Se(2)P(O(i)Pr)(2)}(6)](PF(6)) (X = F, 2a; H, 3a; D, 3a') and [Cu(8)(S){Se(2)P(O(i)Pr)(2)}(6)] (4) in high yields. In addition, fluoride- and hydride-centered Cu(8)(I) clusters [Cu(8)(X){Se(2)P(OEt)(2)}(6)](PF(6)) (X = F, 2b; H, 3b) could be generated in approximately 80% yield by direct reaction of [Cu(CH(3)CN)(4)](PF(6)), NH(4)Se(2)P(OEt)(2), and the anion sources (Bu(4)NF for F(-); NaBH(4) for H(-)) in 8:6:1 ratio. Whereas the structural elucidation of complexes 2 and 4 revealed an anion-centered cubic Cu(8) core surrounded by six dsep ligands, it was a tetracapped tetrahedral copper framework with a hydride in the center in compounds 3. All Cu...Cu distances along either the edge of the cube in 2 and 4 or the tetracapped tetrahedron in 3 are shorter than those identified in 1. Although the cubic (or spherical) contraction of the copper framework that was identified in a series of closed-shell anion-centered (except a hydride) Cu(8) cube having T(h) symmetry could be explained by the existence of strong anion-cation attractions, it was definitely a surprise that the hydride, which is the smallest closed-shell anion and spherical too, induced a tetrahedral contraction of four out of the eight Cu atoms in the empty cube 1, resulting in a tetracapped-tetrahedral geometry and reducing the symmetry to T from T(h). Furthermore the fact that the encapsulated anion induced modulation of the copper core size and symmetry was fully reproduced by DFT calculations on model compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this demonstrated the first example of the reduction of molecular symmetry (from T(h) to T) simply by changing the encapsulated species without altering the general bonding pattern of the surrounding ligands. We also demonstrated that the hydride can easily replace other anions (Cl(-), Br(-), F(-), S(2-), Se(2-)) in a very facile manner to produce hydride-centered species. Eventually, compounds 3 were stable in the presence of other anions, and hydride/deuteride exchange could not be achieved."
18287027,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Involvement of the post-transcriptional regulator Hfq in Yersinia pestis virulence.,"BACKGROUND: Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, which is transmitted primarily between fleas and mammals and is spread to humans through the bite of an infected flea or contact with afflicted animals. Hfq is proposed to be a global post-transcriptional regulator that acts by mediating interactions between many regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and their mRNA targets. Sequence comparisons revealed that Y. pestis appears to produce a functional homologue of E. coli Hfq. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Phenotype comparisons using in vitro assays demonstrated that Y. pestis Hfq was involved in resistance to H(2)O(2), heat and polymyxin B and contributed to growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. The role of Hfq in Y. pestis virulence was also assessed using macrophage and mouse infection models, and the gene expression affected by Hfq was determined using microarray-based transcriptome and real time PCR analysis. The macrophage infection assay showed that the Y. pestis hfq deletion strain did not have any significant difference in its ability to associate with J774A.1 macrophage cells. However, hfq deletion appeared to significantly impair the ability of Y. pestis to resist phagocytosis and survive within macrophages at the initial stage of infection. Furthermore, the hfq deletion strain was highly attenuated in mice after subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Transcriptome analysis supported the results concerning the attenuated phenotype of the hfq mutant and showed that the deletion of the hfq gene resulted in significant alterations in mRNA abundance of 243 genes in more than 13 functional classes, about 23% of which are known or hypothesized to be involved in stress resistance and virulence. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that Hfq is a key regulator involved in Y. pestis stress resistance, intracellular survival and pathogenesis. It appears that Hfq acts by controlling the expression of many virulence- and stress-associated genes, probably in conjunction with small noncoding RNAs."
18287031,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Genomes2Drugs: identifies target proteins and lead drugs from proteome data.,"BACKGROUND: Genome sequencing and bioinformatics have provided the full hypothetical proteome of many pathogenic organisms. Advances in microarray and mass spectrometry have also yielded large output datasets of possible target proteins/genes. However, the challenge remains to identify new targets for drug discovery from this wealth of information. Further analysis includes bioinformatics and/or molecular biology tools to validate the findings. This is time consuming and expensive, and could fail to yield novel drugs if protein purification and crystallography is impossible. To pre-empt this, a researcher may want to rapidly filter the output datasets for proteins that show good homology to proteins that have already been structurally characterised or proteins that are already targets for known drugs. Critically, those researchers developing novel antibiotics need to select out the proteins that show close homology to any human proteins, as future inhibitors are likely to cross-react with the host protein, causing off-target toxicity effects later in clinical trials. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To solve many of these issues, we have developed a free online resource called Genomes2Drugs which ranks sequences to identify proteins that are (i) homologous to previously crystallized proteins or (ii) targets of known drugs, but are (iii) not homologous to human proteins. When tested using the Plasmodium falciparum malarial genome the program correctly enriched the ranked list of proteins with known drug target proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genomes2Drugs rapidly identifies proteins that are likely to succeed in drug discovery pipelines. This free online resource helps in the identification of potential drug targets. Importantly, the program further highlights proteins that are likely to be inhibited by FDA-approved drugs. These drugs can then be rapidly moved into Phase IV clinical studies under 'change-of-application' patents."
18287044,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Dissociable perceptual effects of visual adaptation.,"Neurons in the visual cortex are responsive to the presentation of oriented and curved line segments, which are thought to act as primitives for the visual processing of shapes and objects. Prolonged adaptation to such stimuli gives rise to two related perceptual effects: a slow change in the appearance of the adapting stimulus (perceptual drift), and the distortion of subsequently presented test stimuli (adaptational aftereffects). Here we used a psychophysical nulling technique to dissociate and quantify these two classical observations in order to examine their underlying mechanisms and their relationship to one another. In agreement with previous work, we found that during adaptation horizontal and vertical straight lines serve as attractors for perceived orientation and curvature. However, the rate of perceptual drift for different stimuli was not predictive of the corresponding aftereffect magnitudes, indicating that the two perceptual effects are governed by distinct neural processes. Finally, the rate of perceptual drift for curved line segments did not depend on the spatial scale of the stimulus, suggesting that its mechanisms lie outside strictly retinotopic processing stages. These findings provide new evidence that the visual system relies on statistically salient intrinsic reference stimuli for the processing of visual patterns, and point to perceptual drift as an experimental window for studying the mechanisms of visual perception."
18287053,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,The ups and downs of mutation frequencies during aging can account for the Apert syndrome paternal age effect.,"Apert syndrome is almost always caused by a spontaneous mutation of paternal origin in one of two nucleotides in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2). The incidence of this disease increases with the age of the father (paternal age effect), and this increase is greater than what would be expected based on the greater number of germ-line divisions in older men. We use a highly sensitive PCR assay to measure the frequencies of the two causal mutations in the sperm of over 300 normal donors with a wide range of ages. The mutation frequencies increase with the age of the sperm donors, and this increase is consistent with the increase in the incidence rate. In both the sperm data and the birth data, the increase is non-monotonic. Further, after normalizing for age, the two Apert syndrome mutation frequencies are correlated within individual sperm donors. We consider a mathematical model for germ-line mutation which reproduces many of the attributes of the data. This model, with other evidence, suggests that part of the increase in both the sperm data and the birth data is due to selection for mutated premeiotic cells. It is likely that a number of other genetic diseases have similar features."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Recurrence of intracranial tumors following adoptive T cell therapy can be prevented by direct and indirect killing aided by high levels of tumor antigen cross-presented on stromal cells.,"Elimination of peripheral tumors by adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells may require killing of cancer cells and tumor stromal cells. Tumor Ags are cross-presented on stromal cells, resulting in direct cytotoxic T cell (CTL) killing of both Ag-expressing cancer cells and stromal cells. Indirect killing of Ag loss variant cells also occurs. We show here that similar processes occur in a brain tumor stromal environment. We used murine cancer cell lines that express high or low levels of a peptide Ag, SIYRYYGL (SIY), recognized by transgenic 2C CD8(+) T cells. The two cell lines are killed with equivalent efficiency by 2C T cells in vitro. Following adoptive transfer of 2C T cells into mice with established SIY-Hi or SIY-Lo brain tumors, tumors of both types regressed, but low-Ag-expressing tumors recurred. High-Ag-expressing tumors contained CD11b(+) cells cross-presenting SIY peptide and were completely eliminated by 2C T cells. To further test the role of cross-presentation, RAG1(-/-) H-2(b) mice were infused with H-2(k) tumor cells expressing high levels of SIY peptide. Adoptively transferred 2C T cells are able to kill cross-presenting H-2(b) stromal cells but not H-2(k) tumor cells. In peripheral models, this paradigm led to a small static tumor. In the brain, activated 2C T cells were able to kill cross-presenting CD11b(+) cells and completely eliminate the H-2(k) tumors in most mice. Targeting brain tumor stroma or increasing Ag shedding from tumor cells to enhance cross-presentation may improve the clinical success of T cell adoptive therapies."

Using independent IGE cohorts, we first aimed to confirm the association of 15q13.3 deletions and IGE. We then set out to determine the relative occurrence of sporadic and familial cases and to examine the likelihood of having seizures for individuals with the microdeletion in familial cases. The 15q13.3 microdeletion was identified in 7 of 539 (1.3%) unrelated cases of IGE using quantitative PCR or SNP arrays and confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization analysis using probes specific to the 15q13.3 region. The inheritance of this lesion was tracked using family studies. Of the seven microdeletions identified in probands, three were de novo, two were transmitted from an unaffected parent and in two cases the parents were unavailable. Non-penetrance of the microdeletion was identified in 4/7 pedigrees and three pedigrees included other family members with IGE who lacked the 15q13.3 deletion. The odds ratio is 68 (95% confidence interval 29-181), indicating a pathogenic lesion predisposing to epilepsy with complex inheritance and incomplete penetrance for the IGE component of the phenotype in multiplex families."

18292223,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,A monomeric chicken IgY receptor binds IgY with 2:1 stoichiometry.,"IgY is the principal serum antibody in birds and reptiles, and an IgY-like molecule was the evolutionary precursor of both mammalian IgG and IgE. A receptor for IgY on chicken monocytes, chicken leukocyte receptor AB1 (CHIR-AB1), lies in the avian leukocyte receptor cluster rather than the classical Fc receptor cluster where the genes for mammalian IgE and IgG receptors are found. IgG and IgE receptors bind to the lower hinge region of their respective antibodies with 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas the myeloid receptor for IgA, FcalphaRI, and the IgG homeostasis receptor, FcRn, which are found in the mammalian leukocyte receptor cluster, bind with 2:1 stoichiometry between the heavy chain constant domains 2 and 3 of each heavy chain. In this paper, the extracellular domain of CHIR-AB1 was expressed in a soluble form and shown to be a monomer that binds to IgY-Fc with 2:1 stoichiometry. The two binding sites have similar affinities: K(a)(1) = 7.22 +/- 0.22 x 10(5) m(-1) and K(a)(2) = 3.63 +/- 1.03 x 10(6) m(-1) (comparable with the values reported for IgA binding to its receptor). The affinity constants for IgY and IgY-Fc binding to immobilized CHIR-AB1 are 9.07 +/- 0.07 x 10(7) and 6.11 +/- 0.02 x 10(8) m(-1), respectively, in agreement with values obtained for IgY binding to chicken monocyte cells and comparable with reported values for human IgA binding to neutrophils. Although the binding site for CHIR-AB1 on IgY is not known, the data reported here with a monomeric receptor binding to IgY at two sites with low affinity suggest an IgA-like interaction."
18292230,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Computational identification of potential molecular interactions in Arabidopsis.,"Knowledge of the protein interaction network is useful to assist molecular mechanism studies. Several major repositories have been established to collect and organize reported protein interactions. Many interactions have been reported in several model organisms, yet a very limited number of plant interactions can thus far be found in these major databases. Computational identification of potential plant interactions, therefore, is desired to facilitate relevant research. In this work, we constructed a support vector machine model to predict potential Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein interactions based on a variety of indirect evidence. In a 100-iteration bootstrap evaluation, the confidence of our predicted interactions was estimated to be 48.67%, and these interactions were expected to cover 29.02% of the entire interactome. The sensitivity of our model was validated with an independent evaluation data set consisting of newly reported interactions that did not overlap with the examples used in model training and testing. Results showed that our model successfully recognized 28.91% of the new interactions, similar to its expected sensitivity (29.02%). Applying this model to all possible Arabidopsis protein pairs resulted in 224,206 potential interactions, which is the largest and most accurate set of predicted Arabidopsis interactions at present. In order to facilitate the use of our results, we present the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource, with detailed annotations and more specific per interaction confidence measurements.

18292755,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Transcription regulation of restriction-modification system Ecl18kI.,"Restriction-modification (R-M) system Ecl18kI is representative of R-M systems whose coordinated transcription is achieved through a separate DNA-binding domain of the methyltransferase. M.Ecl18kI recognizes an operator sequence located in the noncoding region that separates the divergently transcribed R and M genes. Here we show that, contrary to previous predictions, the two ecl18kI promoters are not divergent, but actually face one another. The binding of M.Ecl18kI to its operator prevents RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to the M promoter by steric exclusion, but has no direct effect on RNAP interaction with the R promoter. The start point for R transcription is located outside of the intergenic region, opposite the initiation codon of the M gene. Regulated transcription of the potentially toxic ecl18kI R gene is accomplished (i) at the stage of promoter complex formation, through direct competition from complexes formed at the M promoter, and (ii) at the stage of promoter clearance, since R promoter-bound RNAP escapes the promoter more slowly than RNAP bound to the M promoter."
18296487,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Altered hepatic mRNA expression of immune response and apoptosis-associated genes after acute and chronic psychological stress in mice.,"Using a combination of transcriptional profiling and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.ingenuity.com) we investigated acute and chronic psychological stress induced alterations of hepatic gene expression of BALB/c mice. Already after a 2-h single stress session, up-regulation of several LPS and glucocorticoid-sensitive immune response genes and markers related to oxidative stress and apoptotic processes were observed. Support for the existence of oxidative stress was gained by measuring increased protein carbonylation, but no alterations of immune responsiveness or cell death were measured in mice after acute stress compared to the control group. When animals were repeatedly stressed during 4.5-days, we found reduced transcription of antigen presentation molecules, altered mRNA levels of immune cell signaling mediators and persisting high expression of apoptosis-related genes. These alterations were associated with a measurable immune suppression characterized by a reduced ability to clear experimental Salmonella typhimurium infection from the liver and a heightened hepatocyte apoptosis. Moreover, genes associated with anti-oxidative functions and regenerative processes were induced in the hepatic tissue of chronically stressed mice. These findings indicate that modulation of the immune response and of apoptosis-related genes is initiated already during a single acute stress exposure. However, immune suppression will only manifest in repeatedly stressed mice which additionally show induction of protective and liver regenerative genes to prevent further hepatocyte damage."

The idea that a new influenza pandemic might occur in the near future has triggered renewed interests in IAV infection. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is expressed on different cell types and plays a key role in diverse inflammatory processes. We here investigated the role of RAGE in the host response to IAV pneumonia using wild-type (wt) and RAGE deficient ((-/-)) mice. Whereas strong RAGE was constitutively expressed in the lungs of uninfected wt mice, in particular on endothelium, IAV pneumonia was associated with enhanced expression on endothelium and de novo expression on bronchial epithelium. Additionally, the high-affinity RAGE ligand high mobility group box 1 was upregulated during IAV pneumonia. RAGE(-/-) mice were relatively protected from IAV induced mortality and showed an improved viral clearance and enhanced cellular T cell response and activation of neutrophils. These data suggest that RAGE is detrimental during IAV pneumonia."
18296632,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,"Minimum-energy path for a u6 RNA conformational change involving protonation, base-pair rearrangement and base flipping.","The U6 RNA internal stem-loop (U6 ISL) is a highly conserved domain of the spliceosome that is important for pre-mRNA splicing. The U6 ISL contains an internal loop that is in equilibrium between two conformations controlled by the protonation state of an adenine (pK(a)=6.5). Lower pH favors formation of a protonated C-A(+) wobble pair and base flipping of the adjacent uracil. Higher pH favors stacking of the uracil and allows an essential metal ion to bind at this position. Here, we define the minimal-energy path for this conformational transition. To do this, we solved the U6 ISL structure at higher pH (8.0) in order to eliminate interference from the low-pH conformer. This structure reveals disruption of the protonated C-A(+) pair and formation of a new C-U pair, which explains the preference for a stacked uracil at higher pH. Next, we used nudged elastic band molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the minimum-energy path between the two conformations. Our results indicate that the C-U pair is dynamic, which allows formation of the more stable C-A(+) pair upon adenine protonation. After formation of the C-A(+) pair, the unpaired uracil follows a minor-groove base-flipping pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the extrahelical uracil is stabilized by contacts with the adjacent helix."
18296637,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Overgrowth of a mouse model of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome is partly mediated by Indian hedgehog.,"Loss-of-function mutations of Glypican 3 (Gpc3) cause the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (SGBS), and developmental overgrowth is observed in Gpc3-null mice, a mouse model for SGBS. We recently reported that GPC3 inhibits Hedgehog (Hh) signalling by inducing its endocytosis and degradation. Here, we show that the developmental overgrowth observed in Gpc3-null mice is, at least in part, a consequence of the hyperactivation of the Hh pathway. We bred Gpc3-null mice with mice that are Hh signalling-deficient owing to the lack of Indian Hh (Ihh), one of the three mammalian Hhs. We found that the Gpc3-null mice showed a 29.9% overgrowth in an Ihh wild-type background, whereas an Ihh-null background partly rescues the overgrowth caused by the lack of Gpc3 as the double mutants were 19.8% bigger than the Ihh-null mice. Consistent with the role of GPC3 in Hh endocytosis and degradation, the Gpc3-null mice show increased levels of Ihh protein and signalling, but similar levels of Ihh messenger RNA."

Biochem.,9113221,2009,Developmental potential of the murine embryonic stem cells transplanted into the healthy rat brain--novel insights into tumorigenesis.,"Although engraftment of undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into the injured central nervous system (CNS) may lead to targeted cell replacement of lost/damaged cells, sustained proliferative activity combined with uncontrolled differentiation of implanted cells presents a risk of tumor formation. As tumorigenic potential is thought to be associated with pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, pre-differentiation may circumvent this problem. Recently, it has been demonstrated that tumorigenesis occurs despite pre-differentiation if the neural precursor cells are implanted into the brain of a homologous animal (e.g., mouse to mouse). However, xenotransplantation (e.g., mouse to rat) without pre-differentiation, lead to the development of healthy neuronal cells, in absence of tumor formation, suggesting that tumor-suppressive effects of host tissue on engrafted ESCs may play a role in transplant tumorigenesis. We critically investigated tumorigenesis and possible mechanisms of anticipated tumor-suppressive effect under conditions analogous to previously published studies. Xenotransplantation of D-3 murine ESCs into uninjured adult rat brains lacking any preliminary inflammatory potential was found to lead to tumor formation in 5 out of 8 of animals within 2 weeks postimplantation. Tumor-suppressive effects, reflected by Erdo et. al could possibly be ascribed to immunomodulatory activity of macrophages scavenging the tumorigenic fraction of the implanted cells. The importance of number of engrafted cells, implantation site and immunosuppressive effects are discussed as possible variables determining tumorigenic outcome after ESC transplantation."

18303029,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Determination of the mechanism of action of anti-FasL antibody by epitope mapping and homology modeling.,"Fas ligand (FasL) is a 40-kDa type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of proteins and binds to its specific receptor, Fas, a member of the TNF receptor family. Membrane-bound FasL can be processed into a soluble form by a metalloprotease similar to that which cleaves TNFalpha. Elevated levels of FasL have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases ranging from cancer to inflammatory abnormalities, which could be targeted by antibody therapy. We generated a fully human high-affinity antibody against FasL that binds to and neutralizes the activity of both soluble and membrane-associated human FasL. In order to elucidate the mechanism of function of this antibody, we have mapped the region and critical residues involved in the recognition of FasL using a combination of homology modeling, immunoprecipitation, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/DXMS), and alanine scanning site-directed mutagenesis. These studies have revealed the antibody binding site on human FasL. Furthermore, through molecular homology modeling, we have proposed a mechanism for the neutralizing activity of this antibody that involves interference with the docking of the ligand to its receptor by the antibody."
18303947,1,J. Clin. Invest.,7802877,2009,The circadian clock protein Period 1 regulates expression of the renal epithelial sodium channel in mice.,"The mineralocorticoid aldosterone is a major regulator of sodium transport in target epithelia and contributes to the control of blood pressure and cardiac function. It specifically functions to increase renal absorption of sodium from tubular fluid via regulation of the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (alphaENaC). We previously used microarray technology to identify the immediate transcriptional targets of aldosterone in a mouse inner medullary collecting duct cell line and found that the transcript induced to the greatest extent was the circadian clock gene Period 1. Here, we investigated the role of Period 1 in mediating the downstream effects of aldosterone in renal cells. Aldosterone treatment stimulated expression of Period 1 (Per1) mRNA in renal collecting duct cell lines and in the rodent kidney. RNA silencing of Period 1 dramatically decreased expression of mRNA encoding alphaENaC in the presence or absence of aldosterone. Furthermore, expression of alphaENaC-encoding mRNA was attenuated in the renal medulla of mice with disruption of the Per1 gene, and these mice exhibited increased urinary sodium excretion. Renal alphaENaC-encoding mRNA was expressed in an apparent circadian pattern, and this pattern was dramatically altered in mice lacking functional Period genes. These results suggest a role for Period 1 in the regulation of the renal epithelial sodium channel and more broadly implicate the circadian clock in control of sodium balance."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,MAP4K3 modulates cell death via the post-transcriptional regulation of BH3-only proteins.,"Intracellular signal transduction networks involving protein kinases are important modulators of cell survival and cell death in multicellular organisms. Functional compromise of these networks has been linked to aberrant apoptosis in diseases such as cancer. To identify novel kinase regulators of cell death, we conducted an RNAi-based screen to identify modulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Using this approach, we identified MAP4K3 as a novel apoptosis inducer. Here, we present evidence that this pro-apoptotic kinase orchestrates activation of BAX via the concerted posttranscriptional modulation of PUMA, BAD, and BIM. Additionally, we found decreased levels of this kinase in pancreatic cancer samples, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for MAP4K3 in pancreatic tumorigenesis."
18305175,1,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Loss of size selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier in rats following laparotomy and muscle trauma.,"Posttraumatic microalbuminuria may be caused by either charge- or size-selective alterations in the glomerular filtration barrier, or both, and/or to a reduction in proximal tubular protein reabsorption. This study was performed to elucidate the pathophysiology of the increases in glomerular permeability occurring in rats exposed to a laparotomy or to a laparotomy and muscle trauma. In anesthetized Wistar rats (250-280 g), the left ureter was cannulated for urine collection, while simultaneously blood access was achieved. Rats were exposed to trauma by a laparotomy (L; n = 8), or by a combination of L and muscle trauma (MT; L+MT) induced by topical blunt injury of the abdominal muscles bilaterally. After L, muscles were crushed using hemostatic forceps at either 2 x 2 sites (&quot;small&quot; MT; n = 9), or at 2 x 5 sites (&quot;large&quot; MT; n = 9). Sham groups (n = 16), not exposed to a laparotomy, were used as controls. The glomerular sieving coefficients (theta) to polydisperse FITC-Ficoll-70/400 (molecular radius 13-80 A) were determined at 5 or 60 min after L and L+MT, respectively, from plasma and urine samples, and analyzed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. A tissue-uptake technique was used to assess theta for (125)I-labeled serum albumin. L, with or without MT, increased theta for Ficoll(55-80A) and albumin rapidly and markedly. Theta-Ficoll(70A) thus increased approximately threefold, and theta for albumin significantly, for all trauma groups. According to the &quot;two-pore model&quot; of glomerular permeability, these changes mainly reflect an increase in the number of large pores in the glomerular filter without any primary changes in the charge-selective properties of the filter."
18308939,1,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Low pH stimulates vasopressin V2 receptor promoter activity and enhances downregulation induced by V1a receptor stimulation.,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a key role in the urine concentration mechanism via the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) and aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in the kidney. It is well known that V2R is localized on the basolateral side and the V1a receptor (V1aR) is distributed on the luminal side of the collecting ducts. Previously, we reported an increase of V1aR mRNA and a decrease of V2R mRNA in the collecting ducts under chronic metabolic acidosis. However, the regulatory mechanism of V2R in acidic conditions has not yet been determined. In the present study, we investigated the effect of changes in pH on V2R promoter activity, using the LLC-PK(1) cell line stably expressing rat V1aR (LLC-PK(1)/rV1aR). The rV2R promoter activity was significantly increased at 12 h after the incubation in low-pH conditions, which was sustained for 24 h. mRNA and protein expressions of V2R were also increased in low-pH conditions. V1aR stimulation suppressed rV2R promoter activity in a pH-dependent manner. PKA and JNK inhibitors suppressed rV2R promoter activity in both neutral and low-pH conditions without FBS. However, a JNK inhibitor prevented the increase of V2R promoter activity only in low-pH conditions in the presence of FBS. In summary, V2R expression is increased at transcriptional, mRNA, and protein levels in LLC-PK(1)/rV1aR cells under low-pH conditions. Acidic condition-induced V2R enhancement was suppressed by V1aR stimulation, suggesting the crucial role of V1aR in water and electrolyte homeostasis in acidosis."
18309291,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,"Evidence that light, carbon dioxide, and oxygen dependencies of leaf isoprene emission are driven by energy status in hybrid aspen.","Leaf isoprene emission scales positively with light intensity, is inhibited by high carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations, and may be enhanced or inhibited by low oxygen (O(2)) concentrations, but the mechanisms of environmental regulation of isoprene emission are still not fully understood. Emission controls by isoprene synthase, availability of carbon intermediates, or energetic cofactors have been suggested previously. In this study, we asked whether the short-term (tens of minutes) environmental control of isoprene synthesis results from alterations in the immediate isoprene precursor dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMADP) pool size, and to what extent DMADP concentrations are affected by the supply of carbon and energetic metabolites. A novel in vivo method based on postillumination isoprene release was employed to measure the pool size of DMADP simultaneously with the rates of isoprene emission and net assimilation at different light intensities and CO(2) and O(2) concentrations. Both net assimilation and isoprene emission rates increased hyperbolically with light intensity. The photosynthetic response to CO(2) concentration was also hyperbolic, while the CO(2) response curve of isoprene emission exhibited a maximum at close to CO(2) compensation point. Low O(2) positively affected both net assimilation and isoprene emission. In all cases, the variation in isoprene emission was matched with changes in DMADP pool size. The results of these experiments suggest that DMADP pool size controls the response of isoprene emission to light intensity and to CO(2) and O(2) concentrations and that the pool size is determined by the level of energetic metabolites generated in photosynthesis."
18309292,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,(Homo)glutathione depletion modulates host gene expression during the symbiotic interaction between Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti.,"Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, legumes interact with symbiotic rhizobia to produce nitrogen-fixing root nodules. We have previously shown that glutathione and homoglutathione [(h)GSH] deficiencies impaired Medicago truncatula symbiosis efficiency, showing the importance of the low M(r) thiols during the nodulation process in the model legume M. truncatula. In this study, the plant transcriptomic response to Sinorhizobium meliloti infection under (h)GSH depletion was investigated using cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Among 6,149 expression tags monitored, 181 genes displayed significant differential expression between inoculated control and inoculated (h)GSH depleted roots. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the changes in mRNA levels. This transcriptomic analysis shows a down-regulation of genes involved in meristem formation and a modulation of the expression of stress-related genes in (h)GSH-depleted plants. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase histochemical analysis showed that the putative MtPIP2 aquaporin might be up-regulated during nodule meristem formation and that this up-regulation is inhibited under (h)GSH depletion. (h)GSH depletion enhances the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-regulated genes after S. meliloti infection and the expression of SA-regulated genes after exogenous SA treatment. Modification of water transport and SA signaling pathway observed under (h)GSH deficiency contribute to explain how (h)GSH depletion alters the proper development of the symbiotic interaction."
18309293,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,NKG2D-dependent IL-17 production by human T cells in response to an intracellular pathogen.,"We studied the factors that control IL-17 production in human Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. CD4(+) cells from healthy tuberculin reactors produced IL-17 in response to autologous M. tuberculosis-stimulated monocytes, and most IL-17(+) cells were Ag experienced, CD4(+)CD62L(-). IL-17 production by CD4(+) cells was inhibited by anti-IL-23, but not by Abs to IL-1, IL-6, or TGF-beta. Anti-NKG2D reduced IL-17 production and the frequency of CD4(+)CD62(-) IL-17(+) cells, suggesting that NKG2D stimulates IL-17 production. CD4(+)NKG2D(+) cells did not produce IL-17. Monocytes and alveolar macrophages from healthy donors produced IL-23 in response to M. tuberculosis. Addition of CD4(+) cells markedly enhanced IL-23 production by M. tuberculosis-stimulated monocytes, and this was inhibited by anti-NKG2D and by Abs to UL-16 binding protein (ULB)1, a ligand for NKG2D on APCs. We conclude that binding of NKG2D to UL-16 binding protein (ULB)1 contributes to IL-23-dependent IL-17 production by CD4(+) cells in human M. tuberculosis infection."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,"The right to choose: multiple pathways for activating copper,zinc superoxide dismutase.","Since the discovery of SOD1 in 1969, there have been numerous achievements made in our understanding of the enzyme's biochemical reactivity and its role in oxidative stress protection and as a genetic determinant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many recent advances have also been made in understanding the &quot;activation&quot; of SOD1, i.e. the process by which an inert polypeptide is converted to a mature active enzyme through post-translational modifications. To date, two such activation pathways have been identified: one requiring the CCS copper chaperone and one that works independently of CCS to insert copper and activate SOD1 through oxidation of an intramolecular disulfide. Depending on an organism's lifestyle and complexity, different eukaryotes have evolved to favor one pathway over the other. Some organisms rely solely on CCS for activating SOD1, and others can only activate SOD1 independently of CCS, whereas the majority of eukaryotes appear to have evolved to use both pathways. In this minireview, we shall highlight recent advances made in understanding the mechanisms by which the CCS-dependent and CCS-independent pathways control the activity, structure, and intracellular localization of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase, with relevance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and an emphasis on evolutionary biology."
18309295,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,The flexible motif V of Epstein-Barr virus deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate pyrophosphatase is essential for catalysis.,"Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate pyrophosphatases (dUTPases) are ubiquitous enzymes essential for hydrolysis of dUTP, thus preventing its incorporation into DNA. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) dUTPase is monomeric, it has a high degree of similarity with the more frequent trimeric form of the enzyme. In both cases, the active site is composed of five conserved sequence motifs. Structural and functional studies of mutants based on the structure of EBV dUTPase gave new insight into the mechanism of the enzyme. A first mutant allowed us to exclude a role in enzymatic activity for the disulfide bridge involving the beginning of the disordered C terminus. Sequence alignments revealed two groups of dUTPases, based on the position in sequence of a conserved aspartic acid residue close to the active site. Single mutants of this residue in EBV dUTPase showed a highly impaired catalytic activity, which could be partially restored by a second mutation, making EBV dUTPase more similar to the second group of enzymes. Deletion of the flexible C-terminal tail carrying motif V resulted in a protein completely devoid of enzymatic activity, crystallizing with unhydrolyzed Mg(2+)-dUTP complex in the active site. Point mutations inside motif V highlighted the essential role of lid residue Phe(273). Magnesium appears to play a role mainly in substrate binding, since in absence of Mg(2+), the K(m) of the enzyme is reduced, whereas the k(cat) is less affected."
18309296,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Regulation of lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase activity: inhibition of the catalytic domain by the proximal interdomain.,"The lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase LYP, encoded by the PTPN22 gene, recently emerged as a major player and candidate drug target for human autoimmunity. The enzyme includes a classical N-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain and a C-terminal PEST-enriched domain, separated by an approximately 300-amino acid interdomain. Little is known about the regulation of LYP. Herein, by analysis of serial truncation mutants of LYP, we show that the phosphatase activity is strongly inhibited by protein regions C-terminal to the catalytic domain. We mapped the minimal inhibitory region to the proximal portion of the interdomain. We show that the activity of LYP is inhibited by an intramolecular mechanism, whereby the proximal portion of the interdomain directly interacts with the catalytic domain and reduces its activity."

The basic nitrogen of the latter is thought to deprotonate an alkene substrate coordinated to the CpRu center; at this stage the protonated nitrogen could undergo H/D exchange with deuterium oxide. An exceptional degree of deuteration is achieved at positions accessible to isomerization, with a high degree of control. Using biphasic settings one can literally wash out reactive protons on the substrate without using organic solvents."
18310324,1,Nat. Med.,9502015,2009,A small molecule blocking oncogenic protein EWS-FLI1 interaction with RNA helicase A inhibits growth of Ewing's sarcoma.,"Many sarcomas and leukemias carry nonrandom chromosomal translocations encoding tumor-specific mutant fusion transcription factors that are essential to their molecular pathogenesis. Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) contain a characteristic t(11;22) translocation leading to expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 is a disordered protein that precludes standard structure-based small-molecule inhibitor design. EWS-FLI1 binding to RNA helicase A (RHA) is important for its oncogenic function. We therefore used surface plasmon resonance screening to identify compounds that bind EWS-FLI1 and might block its interaction with RHA. YK-4-279, a derivative of the lead compound from the screen, blocks RHA binding to EWS-FLI1, induces apoptosis in ESFT cells and reduces the growth of ESFT orthotopic xenografts. These findings provide proof of principle that inhibiting the interaction of mutant cancer-specific transcription factors with the normal cellular binding partners required for their oncogenic activity provides a promising strategy for the development of uniquely effective, tumor-specific anticancer agents."

Biochem.,9205717,2009,Protective effect of selenoarginine against oxidative stress in D-galactose-induced aging mice.,"The protective effect of selenoarginine against oxidation resistance was investigated in D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mice. The mice were divided into four groups (n=15): a normal group, a model group, a lowdose selenoarginine group (8.35 microg of Se/kg b.w./d), and a high dose selenoarginine group (16.78 microg of Se/kg b.w./d). The aging model was induced by s.c. injection D-galactose dissolved in 0.9% normal saline of a dose of 150 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks. The mice in the normal group received s.c. injection of sterile normal saline at the same dose and frequency. The results showed that oxidative stress in the liver, kidney, and brain tissues and the serum of the mice was induced by D-galactose, but selenoarginine had an obviously protective effect against D-galactose-induced aging mice. Lowdose selenoarginine performed better than high dose selenoarginine. The protective effect of selenoarginine on D-galactose-induced aging mice can be attributed to elevation of the activity of antioxidase and enhanced antioxidant defenses."

To date, there are no reports about anti-pyrethrins rAbs. Here we describe the generation of monomeric and dimeric single chain variable fragments (scFvs) with affinity for six esters of pyrethrins using a subtractive phage display technology. First, scFv libraries with long-linker (Ger(4)Ser)(3) and short-linker (Ger(4)Ser) were established to contain 1.04 x 10(7) or 6.07 x 10(6) transformants. After four rounds of panning, phage ELISA demonstrated that three clones (E2, F2, and H7) showed higher affinity from the long-linker library, and clones (h6, a5) exhibited better antibody activity to pyrethrin I and II from the short-linker library. The scFv candidates were sequenced to identify the specific antibody response against pyrethrins. Isolated scFvs constitute valuable tools for real-time detection of pyrethrins. In addition, the subtractive phage display provides a simple approach for isolation of scFvs."

LMP1 promotes growth and migration of epithelial cells, and the loss of plakoglobin has been identified as a contributing factor to LMP1-induced migration. Plakoglobin is a junctional protein that can also serve as a transcription factor in Tcf/Lef signaling. To determine the effects of LMP1 on the molecular and functional properties of plakoglobin, LMP1 was overexpressed in the NPC cell line C666-1. LMP1 did not affect plakoglobin stability but did decrease plakoglobin transcription. The resultant decreased levels of nuclear plakoglobin did not affect Tcf/Lef activity or the amount of plakoglobin bound to Tcf4. Although LMP1 induced and stabilized beta-catenin, a protein with common binding partners to plakoglobin, the loss of plakoglobin did not affect its association with Tcf4. However, LMP1 did induce a cadherin switch from E- to N-cadherin, a process involved in cancer progression, and enhanced the association of junctional beta-catenin with N-cadherin. LMP1 decreased overall levels of junctional plakoglobin but the remaining junctional plakoglobin was found associated with the induced N-cadherin. This increased association of junctional plakoglobin with N-cadherin was a distinguishing feature of LMP1-expressing cells that have reduced migration due to restoration of plakoglobin. Low levels of plakoglobin were also detected in human NPC tissues. These findings reveal that the effects of LMP1 on junctional plakoglobin and the initiation of a cadherin switch likely contribute to metastasis of NPC."

The stepwise pathways prevail over the concerted pathway in the first case. However, very large concentrations of a base, such as acetate, trigger the beginning of a concerted reaction. The same trend appears, but to a much larger extent, when high local concentration of carboxylates are attached close to the Os complex. The Os(III)-hydroxo/Os(IV)-oxo couple is globally much slower and concerted pathways predominate over the stepwise pathways. Water is, however, not an appropriate proton acceptor in this respect. Other bases, such as citrate or phosphate, are instead quite effective for triggering concerted pathways. Here, we suggest factors causing these contrasting behaviors, providing a practical illustration of the prediction that concerted processes are an efficient way of avoiding high-energy intermediates. Observation of a strong decelerating effect of inactive ions together with the positive role of high local concentrations of carboxylates to initiate a concerted route underscores the variety of structural and medium factors that may operate to modulate and control the occurrence of concerted pathways. These demonstrations and analyses of the occurrence of concerted pathways in an aquo-hydroxo-oxo series are expected to serve as guidelines for studies in term of methodology and factor analysis."
18323779,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Obscurin determines the architecture of the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum.,"The giant protein obscurin is thought to link the sarcomere with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The N-terminus of obscurin interacts with the M-band proteins titin and myomesin, whereas the C-terminus mediates interactions with ankyrin proteins. Here, we investigate the importance of obscurin for SR architecture and organization. Lack of obscurin in cross-striated muscles leads to changes in longitudinal SR architecture and disruption of small ankyrin-1.5 (sAnk1.5) expression and localization. Changes in SR architecture in obscurin knockout mice are also associated with alterations in several SR or SR-associated proteins, such as ankyrin-2 and beta-spectrin. Finally, obscurin knockout mice display centralized nuclei in skeletal muscles as a sign of mild myopathy, but have normal sarcomeric structure and preserved muscle function."
18323857,1,,101251560,2009,Smurf2 as a novel mitotic regulator: From the spindle assembly checkpoint to tumorigenesis.,"ABSTRACT: The execution of the mitotic program with high fidelity is dependent upon precise spatiotemporal regulation of posttranslational protein modifications. For example, the timely polyubiquitination of critical mitotic regulators by Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is essential for the metaphase to anaphase transition and mitotic exit. The spindle assembly checkpoint prevents unscheduled activity of APC/C-Cdc20 in early mitosis, allowing bipolar attachment of kinetochores to mitotic spindle and facilitating equal segregation of sister chromatids. The critical effector of the spindle checkpoint, Mitotic arrest deficient 2 (Mad2), is recruited to unattached kinetochores forming a complex with other regulatory proteins to efficiently and cooperatively inhibit APC/C-Cdc20. A weakened and/or dysfunctional spindle checkpoint has been linked to the development of genomic instability in both cell culture and animal models, and evidence suggests that aberrant regulation of the spindle checkpoint plays a critical role in human carcinogenesis. Recent studies have illuminated a network of both degradative and non-degradative ubiquitination events that regulate the metaphase to anaphase transition and mitotic exit. Within this context, our recent work showed that the HECT (Homologous to E6-AP C-terminus)-family E3 ligase Smurf2 (Smad specific ubiquitin regulatory factor 2), known as a negative regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, is required for a functional spindle checkpoint by promoting the functional localization and stability of Mad2. Here we discuss putative models explaining the role of Smurf2 as a new regulator in the spindle checkpoint. The dynamic mitotic localization of Smurf2 to the centrosome and other critical mitotic structures provides implications about mitotic checkpoint control dependent on various ubiquitination events. Finally, deregulated Smurf2 activity may contribute to carcinogenesis by perturbed mitotic control."
18326491,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,A novel antifungal hevein-type peptide from Triticum kiharae seeds with a unique 10-cysteine motif.,"Two forms of a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP), named WAMP-1a and WAMP-1b, that differ by a single C-terminal amino acid residue and belong to a new structural type of plant AMP were purified from seeds of Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migusch. Although WAMP-1a and WAMP-1b share similarity with hevein-type peptides, they possess 10 cysteine residues arranged in a unique cysteine motif which is distinct from those described previously for plant AMPs, but is characteristic of the chitin-binding domains of cereal class I chitinases. An unusual substitution of a serine for a glycine residue in the chitin-binding domain was detected for the first time in hevein-like polypeptides. Recombinant WAMP-1a was successfully produced in Escherichia coli. This is the first case of high-yield production of a cysteine-rich plant AMP from a synthetic gene. Assays of recombinant WAMP-1a activity showed that the peptide possessed high broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against diverse chitin-containing and chitin-free pathogens, with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. The discovery of a new type of AMP active against structurally dissimilar microorganisms implies divergent modes of action and discloses the complexity of plant-microbe interactions."
18331838,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,A suite of activity-based probes for human cytochrome P450 enzymes.,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes regulate a variety of endogenous signaling molecules and play central roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. We recently showed that an aryl alkyne serves as an effective activity-based probe for profiling mouse liver microsomal P450s in vitro and in vivo. However, individual P450s display distinct substrate and inhibitor specificities, indicating that multiple probe structures may be required to achieve comprehensive coverage of this large and diverse enzyme family. Here, we have synthesized a suite of P450-directed, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) probes that contain: (1) varied chemical architectures validated as mechanism-based inhibitors of the P450 enzyme family, and (2) terminal alkyne groups for click chemistry conjugation of reporter tags. This set of probes was screened against a wide cross-section of human P450s, leading to the discovery of an optimal set of probes that provide broad coverage of this enzyme family. We used these probes to profile the effects on P450 activity of aromatase inhibitors in current clinical use for the treatment of breast cancer. We describe the surprising discovery that one of these aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, significantly increases probe-labeling of P450 1A2, indicative of a heterotypic cooperativity effect on a central P450 isozyme involved in metabolizing numerous drugs and xenobiotics. The results presented herein greatly expand the suite of ABPP probes for profiling P450s and illuminate new applications for these tools to understand P450-drug interactions."
18332111,1,Oncogene,8711562,2009,Interleukin-6 induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in human breast cancer cells.,"Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact, few tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of provoking such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we showed that IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen receptor-alpha-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7(IL-6)) exhibited an EMT phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7(IL-6) cells formed xenograft tumors that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology. Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Expression of immediate-early genes reveals functional compartments within ocular dominance columns after brief monocular inactivation.,"Visual inputs from the 2 eyes in most primates activate alternating bands of cortex in layer 4C of primary visual cortex, thereby forming the well-studied ocular dominance columns (ODCs). In addition, the enzymatic reactivity of cytochrome oxidase (CO) reveals &quot;blob&quot; structures within the supragranular layers of ODCs. Here, we present evidence for compartments within ODCs that have not been clearly defined previously. These compartments are revealed by the activity-dependent mRNA expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), zif268 and c-fos, after brief periods of monocular inactivation (MI). After a 1-3-h period of MI produced by an injection of tetrodotoxin, IEGs were expressed in a patchy pattern that included infragranular layers, as well as supragranular layers, where they corresponded to the CO blobs. In addition, the expressions of IEGs in layer 4C were especially high in narrow zones along boundaries of ODCs, referred to here as the &quot;border strips&quot; of the ODCs. After longer periods of MI (&gt;5 h), the border strips were no longer apparent. When either eyelid was sutured, changes in IEG expression were not evident in layer 4C; however, the patchy pattern of the expression in the infragranular and supragranular layers remained. These changes of IEG expression after MI indicate that cortical circuits involving the CO blobs of the supragranular layers include aligned groups of neurons in the infragranular layers and that the border strip neurons of layer 4C are highly active for a 3-h period after MI."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,NPAS3 is a trachealess homolog critical for lung development and homeostasis.,"Trachealess (Trh) is a PAS domain transcription factor regulating Drosophila tracheogenesis. No other Trh homolog has been associated with a respiratory phenotype. Seeking homolog(s) regulating lung development, we screened murine genomic DNA using trh oligonucleotides, identifying only Npas3. Npas3 mRNA peaks in lung from E10.5 to E13.5, verified by sequencing, with immunostaining in airway epithelial cells. Npas3-null mice have reduced lung branching morphogenesis but are viable prenatally. Npas3-null newborns die in respiratory distress, with diminished alveolarization, decreased Shh, Fgf9, Fgf10, and Bmp4 mRNAs, and increased Spry2, consistent with reduced FGF signaling. Exogenous FGF10 rescues branching morphogenesis in Npas3-null lungs. In promoter reporter assays, NPAS3 directly upregulates Shh and represses Spry2. Npas3(+/-) mice have a milder lung phenotype, surviving postnatally, but develop emphysema and airways hyperreactivity. Therefore, absence of a developmentally expressed transcription factor can alter downstream gene expression and multiple signaling pathways in organogenesis. NPAS3 haploinsufficiency may also lead to emphysema and asthma."
18334212,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Loss of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2alpha activity causes late onset degeneration of spinal cord axons.,"Phosphoinositide (PI) lipids are intracellular membrane signaling intermediates and effectors produced by localized PI kinase and phosphatase activities. Although many signaling roles of PI kinases have been identified in cultured cell lines, transgenic animal studies have produced unexpected insight into the in vivo functions of specific PI 3- and 5-kinases, but no mammalian PI 4-kinase (PI4K) knockout has previously been reported. Prior studies using cultured cells implicated the PI4K2alpha isozyme in diverse functions, including receptor signaling, ion channel regulation, endosomal trafficking, and regulated secretion. We now show that despite these important functions, mice lacking PI4K2alpha kinase activity initially appear normal. However, adult Pi4k2a(GT/GT) animals develop a progressive neurological disease characterized by tremor, limb weakness, urinary incontinence, and premature mortality. Histological analysis of aged Pi4k2a(GT/GT) animals revealed lipofuscin-like deposition and gliosis in the cerebellum, and loss of Purkinje cells. Peripheral nerves are essentially normal, but massive axonal degeneration was found in the spinal cord in both ascending and descending tracts. These results reveal a previously undescribed role for aberrant PI signaling in neurological disease that resembles autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia."
18334215,1,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,High-resolution analysis of epigenetic changes associated with X inactivation.,"Differentiation of female murine ES cells triggers silencing of one X chromosome through X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Immunofluorescence studies showed that soon after Xist RNA coating the inactive X (Xi) undergoes many heterochromatic changes, including the acquisition of H3K27me3. However, the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of heterochromatin remain unclear. We first analyze chromatin changes by ChIP-chip, as well as RNA expression, around the X-inactivation center (Xic) in female and male ES cells, and their day 4 and 10 differentiated derivatives. A dynamic epigenetic landscape is observed within the Xic locus. Tsix repression is accompanied by deposition of H3K27me3 at its promoter during differentiation of both female and male cells. However, only in female cells does an active epigenetic landscape emerge at the Xist locus, concomitant with high Xist expression. Several regions within and around the Xic show unsuspected chromatin changes, and we define a series of unusual loci containing highly enriched H3K27me3. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses show a female-specific quantitative increase of H3K27me3 across the X chromosome as XCI proceeds in differentiating female ES cells. Using female ES cells with nonrandom XCI and polymorphic X chromosomes, we demonstrate that this increase is specific to the Xi by allele-specific SNP mapping of the ChIP-seq tags. H3K27me3 becomes evenly associated with the Xi in a chromosome-wide fashion. A selective and robust increase of H3K27me3 and concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 is observed over active genes. This indicates that deposition of H3K27me3 during XCI is tightly associated with the act of silencing of individual genes across the Xi."
18334220,1,Genetics,374636,2009,Ancestral population genomics: the coalescent hidden Markov model approach.,"With incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the genealogy of closely related species differs along their genomes. The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We use a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four-species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution."
18334631,1,Genetics,374636,2009,Polymorphisms in multiple genes contribute to the spontaneous mitochondrial genome instability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strains.,"The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is required for normal cellular function; inherited and somatic mutations in mtDNA lead to a variety of diseases. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a model to study mtDNA integrity, in part because it can survive without mtDNA. A measure of defective mtDNA in S. cerevisiae is the formation of petite colonies. The frequency at which spontaneous petite colonies arise varies by approximately 100-fold between laboratory and natural isolate strains. To determine the genetic basis of this difference, we applied quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to two strains at the opposite extremes of the phenotypic spectrum: the widely studied laboratory strain S288C and the vineyard isolate RM11-1a. Four main genetic determinants explained the phenotypic difference. Alleles of SAL1, CAT5, and MIP1 contributed to the high petite frequency of S288C and its derivatives by increasing the formation of petite colonies. By contrast, the S288C allele of MKT1 reduced the formation of petite colonies and compromised the growth of petite cells. The former three alleles were found in the EM93 strain, the founder that contributed approximately 88% of the S288C genome. Nearly all of the phenotypic difference between S288C and RM11-1a was reconstituted by introducing the common alleles of these four genes into the S288C background. In addition to the nuclear gene contribution, the source of the mtDNA influenced its stability. These results demonstrate that a few rare genetic variants with individually small effects can have a profound phenotypic effect in combination. Moreover, the polymorphisms identified in this study open new lines of investigation into mtDNA maintenance."
18334637,1,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2009,Suppression of RhoG activity is mediated by a syndecan 4-synectin-RhoGDI1 complex and is reversed by PKCalpha in a Rac1 activation pathway.,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a major regulator of developmental, pathological, and therapeutic angiogenesis. Its activity is partially mediated by binding to syndecan 4 (S4), a proteoglycan receptor. Angiogenesis requires polarized activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1, which involves localized dissociation from RhoGDI1 and association with the plasma membrane. Previous work has shown that genetic deletion of S4 or its adapter, synectin, leads to depolarized Rac activation, decreased endothelial migration, and other physiological defects. In this study, we show that Rac1 activation downstream of S4 is mediated by the RhoG activation pathway. RhoG is maintained in an inactive state by RhoGDI1, which is found in a ternary complex with synectin and S4. Binding of S4 to synectin increases the latter's binding to RhoGDI1, which in turn enhances RhoGDI1's affinity for RhoG. S4 clustering activates PKCalpha, which phosphorylates RhoGDI1 at Ser(96). This phosphorylation triggers release of RhoG, leading to polarized activation of Rac1. Thus, FGF2-induced Rac1 activation depends on the suppression of RhoG by a previously uncharacterized ternary S4-synectin-RhoGDI1 protein complex and activation via PKCalpha."
18334645,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Functional connection between deimination and deacetylation of histones.,"Histone methylation plays key roles in regulating chromatin structure and function. The recent identification of enzymes that antagonize or remove histone methylation offers new opportunities to appreciate histone methylation plasticity in the regulation of epigenetic pathways. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4; also known as PAD4) was the first enzyme shown to antagonize histone methylation. PADI4 functions as a histone deiminase converting a methylarginine residue to citrulline at specific sites on the tails of histones H3 and H4. This activity is linked to repression of the estrogen-regulated pS2 promoter. Very little is known as to how PADI4 silences gene expression. We show here that PADI4 associates with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Kinetic chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PADI4 and HDAC1, and the corresponding activities, associate cyclically and coordinately with the pS2 promoter during repression phases. Knockdown of HDAC1 led to decreased H3 citrullination, concomitantly with increased histone arginine methylation. In cells with a reduced HDAC1 and a slightly decreased PADI4 level, these effects were more pronounced. Our data thus suggest that PADI4 and HDAC1 collaborate to generate a repressive chromatin environment on the pS2 promoter. These findings further substantiate the &quot;transcriptional clock&quot; concept, highlighting the dynamic connection between deimination and deacetylation of histones."
18334649,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Proton transport pathway in the ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter.,"A fundamental question concerning the ClC Cl-/H+ antiporters is the nature of their proton transport (PT) pathway. We addressed this issue by using a novel computational methodology capable of describing the explicit PT dynamics in the ClC-ec1 protein. The main result is that the Glu203 residue delivers a proton from the intracellular solution to the core of ClC-ec1 via a rotation of its side chain and subsequent acid dissociation. After reorientation of the Glu203 side chain, a transient water-mediated PT pathway between Glu203 and Glu148 is established that is able to receive and translocate the proton via Grotthuss shuttling after deprotonation of Glu203. A molecular-dynamics simulation of an explicit hydrated excess proton in this pathway suggests that a negatively charged Glu148 and the central Cl- ion act together to drive H+ to the extracellular side of the membrane. This finding is consistent with the experimental result that Cl- binding to the central site facilitates the proton movement. A calculation of the PT free-energy barrier for the ClC-ec1 E203V mutant also supports the proposal that a dissociable residue is required at this position for efficient delivery of H+ to the protein interior, in agreement with recent experimental results."
18337495,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Identification of aminothienopyridazine inhibitors of tau assembly by quantitative high-throughput screening.,"Inclusions comprised of fibrils of the microtubule- (MT-) associated protein tau are found in the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative tauopathies. The pathology that is observed in these diseases is believed to result from the formation of toxic tau oligomers or fibrils and/or from the loss of normal tau function due to its sequestration into insoluble deposits. Hence, small molecules that prevent tau oligomerization and/or fibrillization might have therapeutic value. Indeed, examples of such compounds have been published, but nearly all have properties that render them unsuitable as drug candidates. For these reasons, we conducted quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) of approximately 292000 compounds to identify drug-like inhibitors of tau assembly. The fibrillization of a truncated tau fragment that contains four MT-binding domains was monitored in an assay that employed complementary thioflavin T fluorescence and fluorescence polarization methods. Previously described classes of inhibitors as well as new scaffolds were identified, including novel aminothienopyridazines (ATPZs). A number of ATPZ analogues were synthesized, and structure-activity relationships were defined. Further characterization of representative ATPZ compounds showed they do not interfere with tau-mediated MT assembly, and they are significantly more effective at preventing the fibrillization of tau than the Abeta(1-42) peptide which forms AD senile plaques. Thus, the ATPZ molecules described here represent a novel class of tau assembly inhibitors that merit further development for testing in animal models of AD-like tau pathology."
18337501,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Solid-state and solution NMR studies of the CAP-Gly domain of mammalian dynactin and its interaction with microtubules.,"Microtubules (MTs) and microtubule binding proteins (MTBPs) play fundamental physiological roles including vesicle and organelle transport, cell motility, and cell division. Despite the importance of the MT/MTBP assemblies, there remains virtually no structural or dynamic information about their interaction at the atomic level due to the inherent insolubility and lack of long-range order of MTs. In this study, we present a combined magic angle spinning solid-state and solution NMR study of the MTBP CAP-Gly domain of mammalian dynactin and its interaction with paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules. We report resonance assignments and secondary structure analysis of the free CAP-Gly in solution and in the solid state by a combination of two- and three-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear correlation spectra. In solution, binding of CAP-Gly to microtubules is accompanied by the broadening of the majority of the peaks in HSQC spectra except for the residues at the termini, precluding further structural analysis of the CAP-Gly/microtubule complexes. In the solid state, DARR spectra of free CAP-Gly and its complex with microtubules display well-resolved lines, permitting residue-specific resonance assignments. Interestingly, a number of chemical shifts in the solid-state DARR spectra of the CAP-Gly/microtubule complex are perturbed compared to those of the free CAP-Gly, suggesting that conformational changes occur in the protein upon binding to the microtubules. These results indicate that CAP-Gly/microtubule assemblies are amenable to detailed structural characterization by magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy and that solid-state NMR is a viable technique to study MT/protein interactions in general."
18337511,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Quasi-2D XY magnetic properties and slow relaxation in a body centered metal organic network of [Co4] clusters.,"Octahedral Co(2+) centers have been connected by mu(3)-OH and mu(2)-OH(2) units forming [Co(4)] clusters which are linked by pyrazine forming a two-dimensional network. The two-dimensional layers are bridged by oxybisbenzoate (OBA) ligands giving rise to a three-dimensional structure. The [Co(4)] clusters bond with the pyrazine and the OBA results in a body-centered arrangement of the clusters, which has been observed for the first time. Magnetic studies reveal a noncollinear frustrated spin structure of the bitriangular cluster, resulting in a net magnetic moment of 1.4 microB per cluster. For T &gt; 32 K, the correlation length of the cluster moments shows a stretched-exponential temperature dependence typical of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless model, which points to a quasi-2D XY behavior. At lower temperature and down to 14 K, the compound behaves as a soft ferromagnet and a slow relaxation is observed, with an energy barrier of ca. 500 K. Then, on further cooling, a hysteretic behavior takes place with a coercive field that reaches 5 T at 4 K. The slow relaxation is assigned to the creation/annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs, which are the elementary excitations of a 2D XY spin system."

18337750,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Modulation of gene expression in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae exposed to bronchoalveolar fluid.,"BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, is an important pathogen of swine throughout the world. It must rapidly overcome the innate pulmonary immune defenses of the pig to cause disease. To better understand this process, the objective of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed in a medium that mimics the lung environment early in the infection process. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Since bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) contains innate immune and other components found in the lungs, we examined gene expression of a virulent serovar 1 strain of A. pleuropneumoniae after a 30 min exposure to BALF, using DNA microarrays and real-time PCR. The functional classes of genes found to be up-regulated most often in BALF were those encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, especially anaerobic metabolism, and in cell envelope, DNA, and protein biosynthesis. Transcription of a number of known virulence genes including apxIVA and the gene for SapF, a protein which is involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides, was also up-regulated in BALF. Seventy-nine percent of the genes that were up-regulated in BALF encoded a known protein product, and of these, 44% had been reported to be either expressed in vivo and/or involved in virulence. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that in early stages of infection, A. pleuropneumoniae may modulate expression of genes involved in anaerobic energy generation and in the synthesis of proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis, as well as established virulence factors. Given that many of these genes are thought to be expressed in vivo or involved in virulence, incubation in BALF appears, at least partially, to simulate in vivo conditions and may provide a useful medium for the discovery of novel vaccine or therapeutic targets."
18337751,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,A targeted constitutive mutation in the APC tumor suppressor gene underlies mammary but not intestinal tumorigenesis.,"Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant hereditary predisposition to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and of a broad spectrum of extra-intestinal tumors. Moreover, somatic APC mutations play a rate-limiting and initiating role in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers. Notwithstanding its multifunctional nature, the main tumor suppressing activity of the APC gene resides in its ability to regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Notably, genotype-phenotype correlations have been established at the APC gene between the length and stability of the truncated proteins encoded by different mutant alleles, the corresponding levels of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity they encode for, and the incidence and distribution of intestinal and extra-intestinal tumors. Here, we report a novel mouse model, Apc1572T, obtained by targeting a truncated mutation at codon 1572 in the endogenous Apc gene. This hypomorphic mutant allele results in intermediate levels of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation when compared with other Apc mutations associated with multifocal intestinal tumors. Notwithstanding the constitutive nature of the mutation, Apc(+/1572T) mice have no predisposition to intestinal cancer but develop multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas and subsequent pulmonary metastases in both genders. The histology of the Apc1572T primary mammary tumours is highly heterogeneous with luminal, myoepithelial, and squamous lineages and is reminiscent of metaplastic carcinoma of the breast in humans. The striking phenotype of Apc(+/1572T) mice suggests that specific dosages of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity differentially affect tissue homeostasis and initiate tumorigenesis in an organ-specific fashion."
18337752,1,Nat. Neurosci.,9809671,2009,Genetic identification of an embryonic parafacial oscillator coupling to the preBötzinger complex.,"The hindbrain transcription factors Phox2b and Egr2 (also known as Krox20) are linked to the development of the autonomic nervous system and rhombomere-related regulation of breathing, respectively. Mutations in these proteins can lead to abnormal breathing behavior as a result of an alteration in an unidentified neuronal system. We characterized a bilateral embryonic parafacial (e-pF) population of rhythmically bursting neurons at embryonic day (E) 14.5 in mice. These cells expressed Phox2b, were derived from Egr2-expressing precursors and their development was dependent on the integrity of the Egr2 gene. Silencing or eliminating the e-pF oscillator, but not the putative inspiratory oscillator (preBötzinger complex, preBötC), led to an abnormally slow rhythm, demonstrating that the e-pF controls the respiratory rhythm. The e-pF oscillator, the only one active at E14.5, entrained and then coupled with the preBötC, which emerged independently at E15.5. These data establish the dual organization of the respiratory rhythm generator at the time of its inception, when it begins to drive fetal breathing."
18339811,1,Nat. Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,Mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 is essential for embryonic development and synapse formation in mice.,"Mitochondrial morphology is dynamically controlled by a balance between fusion and fission. The physiological importance of mitochondrial fission in vertebrates is less clearly defined than that of mitochondrial fusion. Here we show that mice lacking the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 have developmental abnormalities, particularly in the forebrain, and die after embryonic day 12.5. Neural cell-specific (NS) Drp1(-/-) mice die shortly after birth as a result of brain hypoplasia with apoptosis. Primary culture of NS-Drp1(-/-) mouse forebrain showed a decreased number of neurites and defective synapse formation, thought to be due to aggregated mitochondria that failed to distribute properly within the cell processes. These defects were reflected by abnormal forebrain development and highlight the importance of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission within highly polarized cells such as neurons. Moreover, Drp1(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells revealed that Drp1 is required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis, although mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, as examined by the release of Smac/Diablo and Tim8a, may occur independently of Drp1 activity."
18339839,1,Nature,410462,2009,Structure of a prokaryotic virtual proton pump at 3.2 A resolution.,"To reach the mammalian gut, enteric bacteria must pass through the stomach. Many such organisms survive exposure to the harsh gastric environment (pH 1.5-4) by mounting extreme acid-resistance responses, one of which, the arginine-dependent system of Escherichia coli, has been studied at levels of cellular physiology, molecular genetics and protein biochemistry. This multiprotein system keeps the cytoplasm above pH 5 during acid challenge by continually pumping protons out of the cell using the free energy of arginine decarboxylation. At the heart of the process is a 'virtual proton pump' in the inner membrane, called AdiC, that imports L-arginine from the gastric juice and exports its decarboxylation product agmatine. AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily of membrane proteins, which transports amino acids, polyamines and organic cations in a multitude of biological roles, including delivery of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis, facilitation of insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, and, when inappropriately overexpressed, provisioning of certain fast-growing neoplastic cells with amino acids. High-resolution structures and detailed transport mechanisms of APC transporters are currently unknown. Here we describe a crystal structure of AdiC at 3.2 A resolution. The protein is captured in an outward-open, substrate-free conformation with transmembrane architecture remarkably similar to that seen in four other families of apparently unrelated transport proteins."
18344519,1,Nature,410462,2009,miR-145 and miR-143 regulate smooth muscle cell fate and plasticity.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of myriad cellular events, but evidence for a single miRNA that can efficiently differentiate multipotent stem cells into a specific lineage or regulate direct reprogramming of cells into an alternative cell fate has been elusive. Here we show that miR-145 and miR-143 are co-transcribed in multipotent murine cardiac progenitors before becoming localized to smooth muscle cells, including neural crest stem-cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells. miR-145 and miR-143 were direct transcriptional targets of serum response factor, myocardin and Nkx2-5 (NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5) and were downregulated in injured or atherosclerotic vessels containing proliferating, less differentiated smooth muscle cells. miR-145 was necessary for myocardin-induced reprogramming of adult fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells and sufficient to induce differentiation of multipotent neural crest stem cells into vascular smooth muscle. Furthermore, miR-145 and miR-143 cooperatively targeted a network of transcription factors, including Klf4 (Kruppel-like factor 4), myocardin and Elk-1 (ELK1, member of ETS oncogene family), to promote differentiation and repress proliferation of smooth muscle cells. These findings demonstrate that miR-145 can direct the smooth muscle fate and that miR-145 and miR-143 function to regulate the quiescent versus proliferative phenotype of smooth muscle cells."
18344974,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,A genome-wide association study of acenocoumarol maintenance dosage.,"Several genome-wide association studies have been performed on warfarin. For acenocoumarol, the most frequently used coumarin in many countries worldwide, pharmacodynamic influences are expected to be comparable. Pharmacokinetics however might differ. We aimed to confirm known or identify new genetic variants contributing to interindividual variation on stabilized acenocoumarol dosage by a GWAS. The index population consisted of 1451 Caucasian subjects from the Rotterdam study and results were replicated in 287 subjects from the Rotterdam study extended cohort. Both cohorts were genotyped on the Illumina 550K Human Map SNP array. From polymorphisms tested for association with acenocoumarol dosage, 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 and 18 SNPs on chromosome 10 reached genome-wide significance. The SNP with the lowest P-value was rs10871454 on chromosome 16 linked to SNPs within the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) (P = 2.0 x 10(-123)). The lowest P-value on chromosome 10 was obtained by rs4086116 within cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (P = 3.3 x 10(-24)). After adjustment for these SNPs, the rs2108622 polymorphism within cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) gene on chromosome 19 reached genome-wide significance (P = 2.0 x 10(-8)). On chromosome 10, we further identified genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 2C18 (CYP2C18) gene contributing to variance of acenocoumarol dosage. Thus we confirmed earlier findings that acenocoumarol dosage mainly depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. Besides age, gender, body mass index and target INR, one polymorphism within each of the VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and CYP2C18 genes could explain 48.8% of acenocoumarol dosage variation."
18347058,1,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2010,The planar cell polarity protein Van Gogh-Like 2 regulates tumor cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase-dependent invasion.,"Van Gogh-Like 2 (VANGL2) is a planar cell polarity protein essential for collective migration during embryonic development, yet its contribution to tumor cell motility and invasion are unknown. We report for the first time that loss of VANGL2 in human cancer cells promotes efficient collective and directed migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-dependent ECM invasion. We show that VANGL2 knockdown cells exhibit increased activation of secreted MMP2, higher levels of membrane-localized MMP14, and decreased cell-surface fibronectin. These important findings support the notion that planar cell polarity proteins act in coordination with known regulators of cancer cell migration to influence invasion and perhaps metastasis."
18347331,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Interleukin-10 provides direct trophic support to neurons.,"Interleukin (IL)-10, a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to provide beneficial effects in neuronal injury in vivo but the full range of actions has not been established. In order to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying IL-10-mediated neuroprotection, we examined the effect of IL-10 on primary neurons in culture. We found that IL-10 exerted a direct trophic influence on spinal cord neurons, and that activation of the neuronal IL-10 receptor provided trophic support and survival cues to overcome the neurotoxic effects of glutamate in vitro. IL-10 treatment resulted in activation of janus-associated kinases/signal transducers and transcription factors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathways in neurons to enhance expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L); under stress conditions IL-10 blocks cytochrome c release and caspase cleavage. IL-10 activation of the canonical nuclear factor kappaB pathway enhanced translocation of p50 and p65 and enhanced their binding to kappaB DNA sequences, with p50 playing a more prominent role in neuronal survival. These data indicate that in addition to known anti-inflammatory effects through astroglia in other inflammatory cells, IL-10 has direct neuronal effects with important implications for development and neuroprotection."
18353982,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,"NgR RNA interference, combined with zymosan intravitreal injection, enhances optic nerve regeneration.","Mature retinal ganglion cells like other CNS neurons are unable to regenerate their axons after injury. Regenerative failure has been attributed, in part, to two factors: the existence of myelin-derived inhibitors that bind to the Nogo receptor (NgR) and a deficiency of trophic support factors. We investigated the regrowth of injured axons both by inhibiting NgR by RNA interference and by recruiting exogenous trophic support by zymosan intravitreal injection. Our results showed that either approach can stimulate optic nerve axon regrowth but regenerated axons can grow longer and extend further when both methods are combined. We conclude that endogenous NgR inhibition and exogenous trophic support both play independent, important roles in enhancing optic nerve axon regrowth and that the regenerative effect can be augmented when the two are combined. This may provide a therapeutic strategy for promoting axon regeneration in the CNS as well."
18354496,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Properties of Arg481 mutants of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides suggest that neither R481 nor the nearby D-propionate of heme a3 is likely to be the proton loading site of the proton pump.,"Cytochrome c oxidase utilizes the energy from electron transfer and reduction of oxygen to water and pumps protons across the membrane, generating a proton motive force. A large body of biochemical work has shown that all the pumped protons enter the enzyme through the D-channel, which is apparent in X-ray structures as a chain of water molecules connecting D132 at the cytoplasmic surface of the enzyme to E286, near the enzyme active site. The exit pathway utilized by pumped protons beyond this point and leading to the bacterial periplasm is not known. Also not known is the proton loading site (or sites) which undergoes changes in pKa in response to the chemistry at the enzyme active site and drives the proton pump mechanism. In this paper, we examine the role of R481, a highly conserved arginine that forms an ion pair with the D-propionate of heme a3. The R481H, R481N, R481Q, and R481L mutants were examined. The R481H mutant oxidase is approximately 18% active and pumps protons with approximately 40% of the stoichiometry of the wild type. The R481N, R481Q, and R481L mutants each retain only approximately 5% of the steady-state activity, and this is shown to be due to inhibition of steps in the reaction of O(2) with the reduced enzyme. Neither the R481N mutant nor the R481Q mutant oxidases pump protons, but remarkably, the R481L mutant does pump protons with the same efficiency as the R481H mutant. Since the proton pump is clearly operating in the R481L mutant, these results rule out an essential role in the proton pump mechanism for R481 or its hydrogen bond partner, the D-propionate of heme a3."
18354498,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Characterization of clarithromycin resistance in Malaysian isolates of Helicobacter pylori.,"AIM: To characterize the types of mutations present in the 23S rRNA genes of Malaysian isolates of clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). METHODS: Clarithromycin susceptibility of H pylori isolates was determined by E test. Analyses for point mutations in the domain V of 23S rRNA genes in clarithromycin-resistant and -sensitive strains were performed by sequence analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction products. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed using BsaI and MboII enzymes to detect restriction sites that correspond to the mutations in the clarithromycin-resistant strains. RESULTS: Of 187 isolates from 120 patients, four were resistant to clarithromycin, while 183 were sensitive. The MIC of the resistant strains ranged from 1.5 to 24 microg/mL. Two isolates had an A2142G mutation and another two had A2143G mutations. A T2182C mutation was detected in two out of four clarithromycin-resistant isolates and in 13 of 14 clarithromycin-sensitive isolates. Restriction enzyme analyses with BsaI and MboII were able to detect the mutations. CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin resistance is an uncommon occurrence among Malaysian isolates of H pylori strains and the mutations A2142G and A2143G detected were associated with low-level resistance."
18354501,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Human papilloma virus and esophageal carcinoma in a Latin-American region.,"AIM: To investigate the presence of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) in a non-selected Mexican population. METHODS: Cases with a pathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were obtained from Department of Pathology files, at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico City during the period between 2000 and 2008. Slides from each case were reviewed and cases with sufficient neoplastic tissue were selected for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples for polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect HPV DNA sequences. Demographic and clinical data of each patient were retrieved from corresponding clinical records. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 15 (25%) of ESCCs. HPV-16 was the most frequently observed genotype, followed by HPV-18; HPV-59 was also detected in one case. Unfortunately, HPV genotype could not be established in three cases due to lack of material for direct sequencing, although universal primers detected the presence of HPV generic sequences. No low-risk HPV genotypes were found nor was HPV-16/18 co-infection. HPV presence in ESCC was not significantly associated with gender, age, alcohol consumption, smoking, anatomic location, or histologic grade. All patients belonged to low and very low socioeconomic strata, and were diagnosed at advanced disease stage. Male patients were most commonly affected and the male:female ratio in HPV-positive ESCC increased two-fold in comparison with HPV-negative cases (6.5:1 vs 3.1:1). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of high-risk HPV in ESCC in Mexico does not support the hypothesis that HPV-associated ESCC is more common in areas with higher ESCC incidence rates."
18356299,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,The NALCN ion channel is activated by M3 muscarinic receptors in a pancreatic beta-cell line.,"A previously uncharacterized putative ion channel, NALCN (sodium leak channel, non-selective), has been recently shown to be responsible for the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium leak current implicated in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Here, we show that NALCN encodes a current that is activated by M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R) in a pancreatic beta-cell line. This current is primarily permeant to sodium ions, independent of intracellular calcium stores and G proteins but dependent on Src activation, and resistant to TTX. The current is recapitulated by co-expression of NALCN and M3R in human embryonic kidney-293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes. We also show that NALCN and M3R belong to the same protein complex, involving the intracellular I-II loop of NALCN and the intracellular i3 loop of M3R. Taken together, our data show the molecular basis of a muscarinic-activated inward sodium current that is independent of G-protein activation, and provide new insights into the properties of NALCN channels."
18356301,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,"Thrombin stimulates smooth muscle cell differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells via protease-activated receptor-1, RhoA, and myocardin.","RATIONALE: Smooth muscle precursor cells have previously been reported to reside in bone marrow and in the circulation, but little is currently known regarding the proximate stimuli for smooth muscle cell differentiation of these putative progenitors. OBJECTIVE: Because local thrombin generation occurs as an initial response to vascular injury, we hypothesized that thrombin may influence the differentiation of circulating smooth muscle progenitor cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured on type I collagen using a protocol optimized to stimulate smooth muscle cell outgrowth. Thrombin-stimulated upregulation of the transcription factor myocardin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and both were inhibited by hirudin or the RhoA inhibitor Y27632. After 10 days of culture, smooth muscle outgrowth colonies formed, which stained positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and calponin, in addition to having a contractile response to 100 nmol/L angiotensin II. Coincubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with thrombin, 10 micromol/L protease-activated receptor-1, but not protease-activated receptor-4 activating peptide significantly increased the number of smooth muscle outgrowth colonies formed. Thrombin-induced enhancement of smooth muscle outgrowth colony formation was inhibited by hirudin, Y27632, and an antibody against protease-activated receptor-1. CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate a novel thrombin-induced pathway for smooth muscle differentiation from putative smooth muscle progenitors in peripheral blood."
18358808,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Chicken TLR21 acts as a functional homologue to mammalian TLR9 in the recognition of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides.,"Similar to mammalian species, chickens show marked immunological responses to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) both in vivo and in vitro. In mammals, the receptor for ODNs has been demonstrated to be TLR9; however, an orthologue to mammalian TLR9 is absent in the chicken genome. In this study, chicken TLRs 7, 15 and 21 were expressed in mammalian HEK-293T cells; expression of TLR21 but not TLR7 or 15 resulted in marked NF-kappaB activation upon stimulation with exogenous ODN. This activation was not observed when cells were stimulated by TLR agonists other than ODNs. In addition, responsiveness of the ectopically expressed TLR21 demonstrated similar kinetics of activation as reported for mammalian TLR9 and was dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the ODN. The same ODN specificity was observed for chicken HD11 macrophage when ODN mediated activation was monitored by up-regulation of IL1, IL6 and iNOS transcripts. Furthermore, when TLR21, but not TLR15, was partially silenced in HD11 cells by RNA interference, ODN mediated responses were reduced. TLR21-mediated NF-kappaB activation in HEK-293T cells was inhibited by bafilomycin A suggesting that endosomal maturation is required for TLR21 activation and observations by confocal microscopy and digestion with endoglycosidase H suggest TLR21 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of resting cells. Expression of TLR21 transcripts was found in all chicken tissues examined but was significantly less in the lung and small intestine of newly hatched birds. Two of the leucine rich repeat regions (LRRs) of TLR21 showed homology with a LRR conserved within mammalian TLR9 and implicated in ligand binding. We hypothesize that avian TLR21 plays a similar role to that of mammalian TLR9 and enables recognition of microbial DNA as a danger signal resulting in downstream innate and adaptive immune responses."
18358814,1,Cancer Cell,101130617,2009,AKT-independent signaling downstream of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in human cancer.,"Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway occurs frequently in human cancer. PTEN tumor suppressor or PIK3CA oncogene mutations both direct PI3K-dependent tumorigenesis largely through activation of the AKT/PKB kinase. However, here we show through phosphoprotein profiling and functional genomic studies that many PIK3CA mutant cancer cell lines and human breast tumors exhibit only minimal AKT activation and a diminished reliance on AKT for anchorage-independent growth. Instead, these cells retain robust PDK1 activation and membrane localization and exhibit dependency on the PDK1 substrate SGK3. SGK3 undergoes PI3K- and PDK1-dependent activation in PIK3CA mutant cancer cells. Thus, PI3K may promote cancer through both AKT-dependent and AKT-independent mechanisms. Knowledge of differential PI3K/PDK1 signaling could inform rational therapeutics in cancers harboring PIK3CA mutations."
18359851,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Structural and functional studies of the yeast class II Hda1 histone deacetylase complex.,"Yeast class II Hda1 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex is an H2B- and H3-specific HDAC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of three previously identified subunits, the catalytic subunit scHda1p and two non-catalytic structural subunits scHda2p and scHda3p. We co-expressed and co-purified recombinant yeast class II HDAC complex from bacteria as a functionally active and trichostatin-A-sensitive hetero-tetrameric complex. According to an extensive analysis of domain organization and interaction of all subunits (or domains), the N-terminal domain of scHda1p associates through the C-terminal coiled-coil domains (CCDs) of the scHda2p-scHda3p sub-complex, yielding a truncated scHda1pHDAC-scHda2pCCD2-scHda3pCCD3 complex with indistinguishable deacetylase activity compared to the full-length complex in vitro. We characterized the interaction of the HDAC complex with either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA and identified the N-terminal halves of scHda2p and scHda3p as binding modules. A high-resolution structure of the scHda3p DNA-binding domain by X-ray crystallography is presented. The crystal structure shows an unanticipated structural homology with the C-terminal helicase lobes of SWI2/SNF2 chromatin-remodeling domains of the Rad54 family enzymes. DNA binding is unspecific for nucleotide sequence and structure, similar to the Rad54 enzymes in vitro. Our structural and functional analyses of the budding yeast class II Hda1 HDAC complex provide insight into DNA recognition and deacetylation of histones in nucleosomes."
18362332,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Dimerization of tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO decreases its activity and ability to inactivate TrkC.,"Receptor-protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), like receptor tyrosine kinases, regulate neuronal differentiation. While receptor tyrosine kinases are dimerized and activated by extracellular ligands, the extent to which RPTPs dimerize, and the effects of dimerization on phosphatase activity, are poorly understood. We have examined a neuronal type III RPTP, PTPRO; we find that PTPRO can form dimers in living cells, and that disulfide linkages in PTPROs intracellular domain likely regulate dimerization. Dimerization of PTPROs transmembrane and intracellular domains, achieved by ligand binding to a chimeric fusion protein, decreases activity toward artificial peptides and toward a putative substrate, tropomyosin-related kinase C (TrkC). Dephosphorylation of TrkC by PTPRO may be physiologically relevant, as it is efficient, and TrkC and PTPRO can be co-precipitated from transfected cells. Inhibition of PTPROs phosphatase activity by dimerization is interesting, as dimerization of a related RPTP, CD148/PTPRJ, increases activity. Thus, our results suggest a complex relationship between dimerization and activity in type III RPTPs."
18362341,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Hapten-induced dimerization of a single-domain VHH camelid antibody.,"Antibodies that recognize small molecule ligands (haptens) provide unique insight into the immune response and frequently serve as biological reagents for the detection of small molecules. While conventional antibodies typically recognize haptens using two variable domains (VL and VH), much less is known regarding how antibodies with a single variable domain recognize small ligands. Here we investigate the binding thermodynamics for an anti-caffeine camelid (VHH) antibody. Surprisingly, a nonconventional binding stoichiometry was observed in which the final complex includes two VHH domains for every caffeine molecule. DeltaC(p) analysis and size exclusion chromatography support this unusual stoichiometry. An apparent consequence of ligand-induced dimerization is that a relatively high affinity (K(b,obs) = 7.1 x 10(7)) is obtained. The binding profiles of three caffeine metabolites, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine, were also investigated. Each ligand maintains a 2:1 stoichiometry while displaying an approximately 50-fold range of observed binding affinities. These results suggest nonconventional mechanisms of hapten recognition are possible with single-domain antibodies."

Chem.,9716531,2009,Flaviviral protease inhibitors identified by fragment-based library docking into a structure generated by molecular dynamics.,"Fragment-based docking was used to select a conformation for virtual screening from a molecular dynamics trajectory of the West Nile virus nonstructural 3 protease. This conformation was chosen from an ensemble of 100 molecular dynamics snapshots because it optimally accommodates benzene, the most common ring in known drugs, and two positively charged fragments (methylguanidinium and 2-phenylimidazoline). The latter fragments were used as probes because of the large number of hydrogen bond acceptors in the substrate binding site of the protease. Upon high-throughput docking of a diversity set of 18,694 molecules and pose filtering, only five compounds were chosen for experimental validation, and two of them are active in the low micromolar range in an enzymatic assay and a tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay. Evidence for specific binding to the protease active site is provided by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two inhibitors have different scaffolds (diphenylurea and diphenyl ester) and are promising lead candidates because they have a molecular weight of about 300 Da."
18362350,1,Cell Cycle,101137841,2009,A novel small molecule inhibitor of FAK decreases growth of human pancreatic cancer.,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in many types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer, and plays an important role in cell adhesion and survival signaling. Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease and is very resistant to chemotherapy, and FAK has been shown recently to assist in tumor cell survival. Therefore, FAK is an excellent potential target for anti-cancer therapy. We identified a novel small molecule inhibitor (1,2,4,5-Benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride, that we called Y15) targeting the main autophosphorylation site of FAK and hypothesized that it would be an effective treatment strategy against human pancreatic cancer. Y15 specifically blocked phosphorylation of Y397-FAK and total phosphorylation of FAK. It directly inhibited FAK autophosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Y15 increased pancreatic cancer cell detachment and inhibited cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Y15 effectively caused human pancreatic tumor regression in vivo, when administered alone and its effects were synergistic with gemcitabine chemotherapy. This was accompanied by a decrease in Y397-phosphorylation of FAK in the tumors treated with Y15. Thus, targeting the Y397 site of FAK in pancreatic cancer with the small molecule inhibitor, 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride, is a potentially effective treatment strategy in this deadly disease."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Mrgprd enhances excitability in specific populations of cutaneous murine polymodal nociceptors.,"The Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D (Mrgprd) is selectively expressed in nonpeptidergic nociceptors that innervate the outer layers of mammalian skin. The function of Mrgprd in nociceptive neurons and the physiologically relevant somatosensory stimuli that activate Mrgprd-expressing (Mrgprd(+)) neurons are currently unknown. To address these issues, we studied three Mrgprd knock-in mouse lines using an ex vivo somatosensory preparation to examine the role of the Mrgprd receptor and Mrgprd(+) afferents in cutaneous somatosensation. In mouse hairy skin, Mrgprd, as marked by expression of green fluorescent protein reporters, was expressed predominantly in the population of nonpeptidergic, TRPV1-negative, C-polymodal nociceptors. In mice lacking Mrgprd, this population of nociceptors exhibited decreased sensitivity to cold, heat, and mechanical stimuli. Additionally, in vitro patch-clamp studies were performed on cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from Mrgprd(-/-) and Mrgprd(+/-) mice. These studies revealed a higher rheobase in neurons from Mrgprd(-/-) mice than from Mrgprd(+/-) mice. Furthermore, the application of the Mrgprd ligand beta-alanine significantly reduced the rheobase and increased the firing rate in neurons from Mrgprd(+/-) mice but was without effect in neurons from Mrgprd(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate that Mrgprd influences the excitability of polymodal nonpeptidergic nociceptors to mechanical and thermal stimuli."
18364395,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Reelin and Notch1 cooperate in the development of the dentate gyrus.,"The development of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a complex process in which several signaling pathways are involved and likely interact with each other. The extracellular matrix molecule Reelin is necessary both for normal development of the dentate gyrus radial glia and neuronal migration. In Reelin-deficient Reeler mice, the hippocampal radial glial scaffold fails to form, and granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. Here, we show that both formation of the radial glia scaffold and lamination of the dentate gyrus depend on intact Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch signaling in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures induced a phenotype reminiscent of the Reelin-deficient hippocampus, i.e., a reduced density of radial glia fibers and granule cell dispersion. Moreover, a Reelin-dependent rescue of the Reeler phenotype was blocked by inhibition of Notch activation. In the Reeler dentate gyrus, we found reduced Notch1 signaling; the activated Notch intracellular domain as well as the transcriptional targets, brain lipid-binding protein, and Hes5 are decreased. Disabled1, a component of the Reelin-signaling pathway colocalizes with Notch1, thus indicating a direct interaction between the Reelin- and Notch1-signaling pathways. These results suggest that Reelin enhances Notch1 signaling, thereby contributing to the formation of the radial glial scaffold and the normal development of the dentate gyrus."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Mice with altered myelin proteolipid protein gene expression display cognitive deficits accompanied by abnormal neuron-glia interactions and decreased conduction velocities.,"Conduction velocity (CV) of myelinated axons has been shown to be regulated by oligodendrocytes even after myelination has been completed. However, how myelinating oligodendrocytes regulate CV, and what the significance of this regulation is for normal brain function remain unknown. To address these questions, we analyzed a transgenic mouse line harboring extra copies of the myelin proteolipid protein 1 (plp1) gene (plp1(tg/-) mice) at 2 months of age. At this stage, the plp1(tg/-) mice have an unaffected myelin structure with a normally appearing ion channel distribution, but the CV in all axonal tracts tested in the CNS is greatly reduced. We also found decreased axonal diameters and slightly abnormal paranodal structures, both of which can be a cause for the reduced CV. Interestingly the plp1(tg/-) mice showed altered anxiety-like behaviors, reduced prepulse inhibitions, spatial learning deficits and working memory deficit, all of which are schizophrenia-related behaviors. Our results implicate that abnormalities in the neuron-glia interactions at the paranodal junctions can result in reduced CV in the CNS, which then induces behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia."
18367666,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,"Comparative analysis of ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III function in Drosophila by efficient isolation of ESCRT mutants.","ESCRT proteins were initially isolated in yeast as a single functional set of conserved components controlling endosomal cargo sorting and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. Recent work has suggested that metazoan ESCRT proteins might have more functionally diverse roles, but the limited availability of ESCRT mutants in species other than yeast has hampered a thorough analysis. Here, we used a genetic screening strategy based on both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous growth-promotion phenotypes to isolate null mutations in nearly half of the ESCRT-encoding genes of Drosophila, including components of ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes. All ESCRT components are required for trafficking of ubiquitylated proteins and are required to prevent excess Notch and EGFR signaling. However, cells lacking certain ESCRT-III components accumulate fewer ubiquitylated molecules in endosomes and display reduced degrees of cell proliferation compared with those lacking components of ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II. Moreover, although we find by ultrastructural analysis that MVB formation is impaired in ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II mutant cells, MVB biogenesis still occurs to some degree in ESCRT-III mutant cells. This work highlights the multiple cell biological and developmental roles of ESCRT proteins in Drosophila, suggests that the metazoan ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes do not serve identical functions, and provides the basis for an extensive analysis of metazoan ESCRT function."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 tyrosine 1175 signaling controls VEGF-induced von Willebrand factor release from endothelial cells via phospholipase C-gamma 1- and protein kinase A-dependent pathways.,"There is increasing evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to inflammation independent of its angiogenic functions. Targeting some of the components in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) effectively inhibits VEGF-induced inflammation, but little is known about how VEGF regulates WPB exocytosis. In this study, we showed that VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGFR1, is responsible for VEGF-induced release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a major marker of WPBs. This is in good contrast to VEGF-stimulated interleukin-6 release from endothelium, which is selectively mediated through VEGFR1. We further demonstrated that VEGFR2-initiated phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCgamma1)/calcium signaling is important but insufficient for full vWF release, suggesting the possible participation of another effector pathway. We found that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is required for full vWF release. Importantly, a single mutation of Tyr(1175) in the C terminus of VEGFR2, a tyrosine residue crucial for embryonic vasculogenesis, abolished vWF release, concomitant with defective activations of both PLCgamma1 and PKA. These data suggest that Tyr(1175) mediates both PLCgamma1-dependent and PKA-dependent signaling pathways. Taken together, our results not only reveal a novel Tyr(1175)-mediated signaling pathway but also highlight a potentially new therapeutic target for the management of vascular inflammation."
18369319,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Differential regulation of elastic fiber formation by fibulin-4 and -5.,"Fibulin-4 and -5 are extracellular glycoproteins with essential non-compensatory roles in elastic fiber assembly. We have determined how they interact with tropoelastin, lysyl oxidase, and fibrillin-1, thereby revealing how they differentially regulate assembly. Strong binding between fibulin-4 and lysyl oxidase enhanced the interaction of fibulin-4 with tropoelastin, forming ternary complexes that may direct elastin cross-linking. In contrast, fibulin-5 did not bind lysyl oxidase strongly but bound tropoelastin in terminal and central regions and could concurrently bind fibulin-4. Both fibulins differentially bound N-terminal fibrillin-1, which strongly inhibited their binding to lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin. Knockdown experiments revealed that fibulin-5 controlled elastin deposition on microfibrils, although fibulin-4 can also bind fibrillin-1. These experiments provide a molecular account of the distinct roles of fibulin-4 and -5 in elastic fiber assembly and how they act in concert to chaperone cross-linked elastin onto microfibrils."

It was proposed to be involved in genomic instability, aging and alternative telomere lengthening. Our study presents novel mammalian cell-free system for eccDNA generation. Using purified protein extract we show that eccDNA formation does not involve de-novo DNA synthesis suggesting that eccDNA is generated through excision of chromosomal sequences. This process is carried out by sequence-independent enzymes as human protein extract can produce mouse-specific eccDNA from high molecular weight mouse DNA, and vice versa. EccDNA production does not depend on ATP, requires residual amounts of Mg(2+) and is enhanced by double strand DNA breaks."
18375758,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Adding pioglitazone to insulin containing regimens in type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is treated in a stepwise manner, progressing from diet and physical activity to oral antidiabetic agents and insulin. The oral agent pioglitazone is licensed for use with insulin when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the extent to which adding pioglitazone to insulin-containing regimens produces benefits in terms of patient-relevant outcomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight, and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised according to standard systematic review methodology and in a meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092 patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12 weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45 mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58% (95% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p&lt;0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly more frequent in the pioglitazone arms (relative risk 1.27; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: When added to insulin regimens, pioglitazone confers a small advantage in terms of HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients with previous inadequate glucose control, but at the cost of increased hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Other considerations include the risk of heart failure, fractures in women, a reduced insulin dose, and the net financial cost."

Cancer,370635,2009,"Height and risk of prostate cancer in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial.","BACKGROUND: The relationship between prostate cancer and height is uncertain. METHODS: We prospectively examined the association of height with prostate cancer among 34,268 men in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer trial. Anthropometry was assessed at baseline and 2144 incident prostate cancer cases were identified upto 8.9 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, tallness was not associated with the risk of prostate cancer or with the risk of non-aggressive disease, but the risk for aggressive prostate cancer tended to be greater in taller men (Gleason score &gt; or = 7 or stage &gt; or = III; P trend=0.05; relative risk (RR) for 190 cm + vs &lt; or = 170 cm = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.96-2.01). This association was largely limited to men below the age of 65 years (P trend=0.008; RR for 190 cm + vs &lt; or = 170 cm = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.06-2.93; P for interaction=0.009), although the number of cases was small and risk estimates were somewhat unstable. CONCLUSION: The results of this large prospective prostate cancer screening trial suggest that tallness is associated with increased risk for younger onset aggressive prostate cancer."
18378904,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Numb regulates post-endocytic trafficking and degradation of Notch1.,"Notch is a transmembrane receptor that controls cell fate decisions during development and tissue homeostasis. Both activation and attenuation of the Notch signal are tightly regulated by endocytosis. The adaptor protein Numb acts as an inhibitor of Notch and is known to function within the intracellular trafficking pathways. However, a role for Numb in regulating Notch trafficking has not been defined. Here we show that mammalian Notch1 is constitutively internalized and trafficked to both recycling and late endosomal compartments, and we demonstrate that changes in Numb expression alter the dynamics of Notch1 trafficking. Overexpression of Numb promotes sorting of Notch1 through late endosomes for degradation, whereas depletion of Numb facilitates Notch1 recycling. Numb mutants that do not interact with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, Itch, or that lack motifs important for interaction with endocytic proteins fail to promote Notch1 degradation. Our data suggest that Numb inhibits Notch1 activity by regulating post-endocytic sorting events that lead to Notch1 degradation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Met induces diverse mammary carcinomas in mice and is associated with human basal breast cancer.,"Understanding the signaling pathways that drive aggressive breast cancers is critical to the development of effective therapeutics. The oncogene MET is associated with decreased survival in breast cancer, yet the role that MET plays in the various breast cancer subtypes is unclear. We describe a knockin mouse with mutationally activated Met (Met(mut)) that develops a high incidence of diverse mammary tumors with basal characteristics, including metaplasia, absence of progesterone receptor and ERBB2 expression, and expression of cytokeratin 5. With gene expression and tissue microarray analysis, we show that high MET expression in human breast cancers significantly correlated with estrogen receptor negative/ERBB2 negative tumors and with basal breast cancers. Few treatment options exist for breast cancers of the basal or trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2 subtypes. We conclude from these studies that MET may play a critical role in the development of the most aggressive breast cancers and may be a rational therapeutic target."
18385378,1,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,AtTRP1 encodes a novel TPR protein that interacts with the ethylene receptor ERS1 and modulates development in Arabidopsis.,"Arabidopsis AtTRP1 is an orthologue of SlTPR1, a tomato tetratricopeptide repeat protein that interacts with the tomato ethylene receptors LeETR1 and NR in yeast 2-hybrid assays and in vitro, and modulates plant development. AtTRP1 is encoded by a single copy gene in the Arabidopsis genome, and is related to TCC1, a human protein that competes with Raf-1 for Ras binding, and distantly related to the immunophilin-like FK-binding proteins TWD1 and PAS1. The former is involved in auxin transport and the latter is translocated to the nucleus in response to auxin. AtTRP1 interacted preferentially with the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor ERS1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. This association was confirmed by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation. AtTRP1 promoter-GUS was highly expressed in vascular tissue, mature anthers, the abscission zone, and was induced by ACC. Overexpression of AtTRP1 in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in dwarf plants with reduced fertility, altered leaf/silique morphology, and enhanced expression of the ethylene responsive gene AtChitB. Exogenous GA did not reverse the dwarf habit. Etiolated transgenic seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 displayed enhanced sensitivity to low ACC and this was correlated with the transgene expression. Seedlings overexpressing AtTRP1 at high levels exhibited shortened and swollen hypocotyls, inhibited root growth, and an altered apical hook. Plants overexpressing AtTRP1 also showed a reduced response to exogenous IAA and altered expression of a subset of auxin early responsive genes. These results indicated that overexpression of AtTRP1 affects cross-talk between ethylene and auxin signalling and enhances some ethylene responses and alters some auxin responses. A model for AtTRP1 action is proposed."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,DNA polymerase zeta cooperates with polymerases kappa and iota in translesion DNA synthesis across pyrimidine photodimers in cells from XPV patients.,"Human cells tolerate UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), carried out by DNA polymerase eta, the POLH gene product. A deficiency in DNA polymerase eta due to germ-line mutations in POLH causes the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV), which is characterized by sunlight sensitivity and extreme predisposition to sunlight-induced skin cancer. XPV cells are UV hypermutable due to the activity of mutagenic TLS across CPD, which explains the cancer predisposition of the patients. However, the identity of the backup polymerase that carries out this mutagenic TLS was unclear. Here, we show that DNA polymerase zeta cooperates with DNA polymerases kappa and iota to carry out error-prone TLS across a TT CPD. Moreover, DNA polymerases zeta and kappa, but not iota, protect XPV cells against UV cytotoxicity, independently of nucleotide excision repair. This presents an extreme example of benefit-risk balance in the activity of TLS polymerases, which provide protection against UV cytotoxicity at the cost of increased mutagenic load."
18387954,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Cholinergic filtering in the recurrent excitatory microcircuit of cortical layer 4.,"Neocortical acetylcholine (ACH) release is known to enhance signal processing by increasing the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensory responses. It is widely accepted that the larger sensory responses are caused by a persistent increase in the excitability of all cortical excitatory neurons. Here, contrary to this concept, we show that ACH persistently inhibits layer 4 (L4) spiny neurons, the main targets of thalamocortical inputs. Using whole-cell recordings in slices of rat primary somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate that this inhibition is specific to L4 and contrasts with the ACH-induced persistent excitation of pyramidal cells in L2/3 and L5. We find that this inhibition is induced by postsynaptic M(4)-muscarinic ACH receptors and is mediated by the opening of inwardly rectifying potassium (K(ir)) channels. Pair recordings of L4 spiny neurons show that ACH reduces synaptic release in the L4 recurrent microcircuit. We conclude that ACH has a differential layer-specific effect that results in a filtering of weak sensory inputs in the L4 recurrent excitatory microcircuit and a subsequent amplification of relevant inputs in L2/3 and L5 excitatory microcircuits. This layer-specific effect may contribute to improve cortical SNR."
18388201,1,J. Gen. Physiol.,2985110R,2009,Coupling between the voltage-sensing and phosphatase domains of Ci-VSP.,"The Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor-containing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) shares high homology with the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase enzyme known as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10). We have taken advantage of the similarity between these proteins to inquire about the coupling between the voltage sensing and the phosphatase domains in Ci-VSP. Recently, it was shown that four basic residues (R11, K13, R14, and R15) in PTEN are critical for its binding onto the membrane, required for its catalytic activity. Ci-VSP has three of the basic residues of PTEN. Here, we show that when R253 and R254 (which are the homologues of R14 and R15 in PTEN) are mutated to alanines in Ci-VSP, phosphatase activity is disrupted, as revealed by a lack of effect on the ionic currents of KCNQ2/3, where current decrease is a measure of phosphatase activity. The enzymatic activity was not rescued by the introduction of lysines, indicating that the binding is an arginine-specific interaction between the phosphatase binding domain and the membrane, presumably through the phosphate groups of the phospholipids. We also found that the kinetics and steady-state voltage dependence of the S4 segment movement are affected when the arginines are not present, indicating that the interaction of R253 and R254 with the membrane, required for the catalytic action of the phosphatase, restricts the movement of the voltage sensor."
18388856,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,Human naive and memory CD4+ T cell repertoires specific for naturally processed antigens analyzed using libraries of amplified T cells.,"The enormous diversity of the naive T cell repertoire is instrumental in generating an immune response to virtually any foreign antigen that can be processed into peptides that bind to MHC molecules. The low frequency of antigen-specific naive T cells, their high activation threshold, and the constrains of antigen-processing and presentation have hampered analysis of naive repertoires to complex protein antigens. In this study, libraries of polyclonally expanded naive T cells were used to determine frequency and antigen dose-response of human naive CD4(+) T cells specific for a variety of antigens and to isolate antigen-specific T cell clones. In the naive repertoire, T cells specific for primary antigens, such as KLH and Bacillus anthracis protective antigen, and for recall antigens, such as tetanus toxoid, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative, were detected at frequencies ranging from 5 to 170 cells per 10(6) naive T cells. Antigen concentrations required for half-maximal response (EC50) varied over several orders of magnitude for different naive T cells. In contrast, in the memory repertoire, T cells specific for primary antigens were not detected, whereas T cells specific for recall antigens were detected at high frequencies and displayed EC50 values in the low range of antigen concentrations. The method described may find applications for evaluation of vaccine candidates, for testing antigenicity of therapeutic proteins, drugs, and chemicals, and for generation of antigen-specific T cell clones for adoptive cellular immunotherapy."
18388858,1,Virology,110674,2009,Effects of allergic airway disease on mouse adenovirus type 1 respiratory infection.,"Virus infection may contribute to asthma pathogenesis. In turn, a Th2-polarized pulmonary environment may increase host susceptibility to infection. We used a cockroach antigen (CRA) model of allergic airway disease to test the hypothesis that Th2 cytokine overproduction increases susceptibility to mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1). CRA sensitization led to upregulated lung expression of IL-4 and IL-13, lung cellular inflammation, and exaggerated airway mucus production. Following intranasal MAV-1 infection, lung cellular inflammation was more pronounced in CRA-sensitized mice than in unsensitized mice at 7 days post-infection but not at a later time point. CRA sensitization did not significantly suppress lung IFN-gamma expression, and lung IFN-gamma expression was upregulated in both CRA-sensitized mice and unsensitized mice over the course of MAV-1 infection. Despite CRA-induced differences in pulmonary inflammation, MAV-1 viral loads in lung and spleen and MAV-1 gene expression in the lung did not differ between CRA-sensitized and unsensitized mice. Our data therefore suggest that MAV-1 pathogenesis is not affected directly or indirectly by the Th2 polarization associated with allergic airway disease."
18388957,1,Cell,413066,2009,Mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor catalytic domain by the juxtamembrane segment.,"Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor requires an allosteric interaction between the kinase domains of two receptors, whereby one activates the other. We show that the intracellular juxtamembrane segment of the receptor, known to potentiate kinase activity, is able to dimerize the kinase domains. The C-terminal half of the juxtamembrane segment latches the activated kinase domain to the activator, and the N-terminal half of this segment further potentiates dimerization, most likely by forming an antiparallel helical dimer that engages the transmembrane helices of the activated receptor. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which the extracellular domains block the intrinsic ability of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to dimerize and activate, with ligand binding releasing this block. The formation of the activating juxtamembrane latch is prevented by the C-terminal tails in a structure of an inactive kinase domain dimer, suggesting how alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation."
18390592,1,Cell,413066,2009,Structure of N-terminal domain of NPC1 reveals distinct subdomains for binding and transfer of cholesterol.,"LDL delivers cholesterol to lysosomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exit of cholesterol from lysosomes requires two proteins, membrane-bound Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and soluble NPC2. NPC2 binds cholesterol with its isooctyl side chain buried and its 3beta-hydroxyl exposed. Here, we describe high-resolution structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1 and complexes with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. NPC1(NTD) binds cholesterol in an orientation opposite to NPC2: 3beta-hydroxyl buried and isooctyl side chain exposed. Cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) requires reorientation of a helical subdomain in NPC1(NTD), enlarging the opening for cholesterol entry. NPC1 with point mutations in this subdomain (distinct from the binding subdomain) cannot accept cholesterol from NPC2 and cannot restore cholesterol exit from lysosomes in NPC1-deficient cells. We propose a working model wherein after lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters, cholesterol binds NPC2, which transfers it to NPC1(NTD), reversing its orientation and allowing insertion of its isooctyl side chain into the outer lysosomal membranes."
18390806,1,Proteomics,101092707,2009,Systems approach to explore components and interactions in the presynapse.,"The application of proteomic techniques to neuroscientific research provides an opportunity for a greater understanding of nervous system structure and function. As increasing amounts of neuroproteomic data become available, it is necessary to formulate methods to integrate these data in a meaningful way to obtain a more comprehensive picture of neuronal subcompartments. Furthermore, computational methods can be used to make biologically relevant predictions from large proteomic data sets. Here, we applied an integrated proteomics and systems biology approach to characterize the presynaptic (PRE) nerve terminal. For this, we carried out proteomic analyses of presynaptically enriched fractions, and generated a PRE literature-based protein-protein interaction network. We combined these with other proteomic analyses to generate a core list of 117 PRE proteins, and used graph theory-inspired algorithms to predict 92 additional components and a PRE complex containing 17 proteins. Some of these predictions were validated experimentally, indicating that the computational analyses can identify novel proteins and complexes in a subcellular compartment. We conclude that the combination of techniques (proteomics, data integration, and computational analyses) used in this study are useful in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of functional components, especially low-abundance entities and/or interactions in the PRE nerve terminal."
18391197,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Temporal and spatial analysis of clinical and molecular parameters in dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Murine colitis model induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) is an animal model of IBD that is commonly used to address the pathogenesis of IBD as well as to test efficacy of therapies. In this study we systematically analyzed clinical parameters, histological changes, intestinal barrier properties and cytokine profile during the colitic and recovery phase. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were administered with 3.5% of DSS in drinking water for various times. Clinical and histological features were determined using standard criteria. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, transepithelial permeability and proinflammatory mediators were determined in whole colon or proximal and distal parts of colon. RESULTS: As expected after administration of DSS, mice manifest loss of body weight, shortening of colon length and bloody feces. Histological manifestations included shortening and loss of crypts, infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophil, symptoms attenuated after DSS withdrawal. The MPO value, as inflammation indicator, also increases significantly at all periods of DSS treatment, and even after DSS withdrawal, it still held at very high levels. Trans-mucosal permeability increased during DSS treatment, but recovered to almost control level after DSS withdrawal. The production of proinflammatory mediators by colonic mucosa were enhanced during DSS treatment, and then recovered to pre-treated level after DSS withdrawal. Finally, enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators also revealed a different profile feature in proximal and distal parts of the colon. CONCLUSION: Experimental colitis induced by DSS is a good animal model to study the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and intervention against IBD, especially UC."
18391200,1,Oncogene,8711562,2009,"Mammalian cell-cycle regulation: several Cdks, numerous cyclins and diverse compensatory mechanisms.","After a decade of extensive work on gene knockout mouse models of cell-cycle regulators, the classical model of cell-cycle regulation was seriously challenged. Several unexpected compensatory mechanisms were uncovered among cyclins and Cdks in these studies. The most astonishing observation is that Cdk2 is dispensable for the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle with both Cdk4 and Cdk1 covering for Cdk2's functions. Similar to yeast, it was recently discovered that Cdk1 alone can drive the mammalian cell cycle, indicating that the regulation of the mammalian cell cycle is highly conserved. Nevertheless, cell-cycle-independent functions of Cdks and cyclins such as in DNA damage repair are still under investigation. Here we review the compensatory mechanisms among major cyclins and Cdks in mammalian cell-cycle regulation."
18391203,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,The mechanism of iron homeostasis in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and its relationship to oxidative stress.,"In this article, we demonstrate the connection between intracellular iron storage and oxidative stress response in cyanobacteria. Iron is essential for the survival of all organisms. However, the redox properties that make iron a valuable cofactor also lead to oxidative interactions, resulting in the formation of harmful radicals. Therefore, iron accumulation in cells should be tightly regulated, a process in which ferritin family proteins play an important role. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two ferritin-type storage complexes, bacterioferritin and MrgA. Previous studies demonstrated the role of bacterioferritin and MrgA in iron storage. In addition, MrgA was found to play a key role in oxidative stress response. Here, we examined the dual role of the ferritin family proteins using physiological and transcriptomic approaches. Microarray analysis of iron-limited wild-type and DeltamrgA cultures revealed a substantial up-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes in mutant cells. The PerR regulator was found to play an important role in that process. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the connection between internal iron quota, the presence of the two storage complexes, and the sensitivity to externally applied oxidative stress. These data suggest a pivotal role for the ferritin-type proteins of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in coordinating iron homeostasis and in oxidative stress response. The combined action of the two complexes allows for the safe accumulation and release of iron from storage by minimizing damage resulting from interactions between reduced iron and the oxygen radicals that are produced in abundance by the photosynthetic apparatus."
18391205,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Mechanisms of opioid-mediated inhibition of human T cell receptor signaling.,"Opioids are widely used for the treatment of severe pain. However, it is also known that opioids, in particular morphine, cause immunosuppression. Therefore, their use may complicate treatment of persons with an already impaired immune system, e.g., patients suffering from cancer or AIDS. We investigated the mechanisms of opioid-induced immunosuppression in primary human T lymphocytes and the human T cell line Jurkat. We demonstrated that morphine and the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin inhibited the transcription of IL-2 in activated human T lymphocytes as well as the activation of the transcription factors AP-1, NFAT, and NF-kappaB, which transactivate IL-2. In addition, the TCR-induced calcium flux and MAPK activation were inhibited by the opioids, as well as proximal signaling events, such as the phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells and Zap70. A more detailed characterization of the mechanism revealed that incubation of T cells with the opioids caused a marked increase in cAMP. This in turn activated protein kinase A, which augmented the kinase activity of C-terminal Src kinase bound to phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enrich microdomains, resulting in a further enhancement of the tonic inhibition of the leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase Lck, thereby blocking the initiation of TCR signaling. These effects were mediated by mu opioid receptors. Our findings contribute to the understanding of immunosuppressive side effects of morphine. Since beta-endorphin is expressed and secreted by immune effector cells, including T cells, and up-regulated in these cells by various stimuli, our data also suggest an inhibitory role for beta-endorphin in the physiological regulation of T cell activation."
18391209,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Focal adhesion kinase regulates pathogen-killing capability and life span of neutrophils via mediating both adhesion-dependent and -independent cellular signals.,"Various neutrophil functions such as phagocytosis, superoxide production, and survival are regulated by integrin signaling. Despite the essential role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in mediating this signaling pathway, its exact function in neutrophils is ill defined. In this study, we investigated the role of FAK in neutrophils using a myeloid-specific conditional FAK knockout mouse. As reported in many other cell types, FAK is required for regulation of focal adhesion dynamics when neutrophils adhere to fibronectin or ICAM-1. Adhesion on VCAM-1-coated surfaces and chemotaxis after adhesion were not altered in FAK null neutrophils. In addition, we observed significant reduction in NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production and complement-mediated phagocytosis in FAK null neutrophils. As a result, these neutrophils displayed decreased pathogen killing capability both in vitro and in vivo in a mouse peritonitis model. In adherent cells, the defects associated with FAK deficiency are likely due to suppression of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) signaling and chemoattractant-elicited calcium signaling. Disruption of FAK also reduced chemoattractant-elicited superoxide production in suspended neutrophils in the absence of cell adhesion. This may be solely caused by suppression of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling in these cells, because the fMLP-elicited calcium signal was not altered. Consistent with decreased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/Akt signaling in FAK null neutrophils, we also observed accelerated spontaneous death in these cells. Taken together, our results revealed previously unrecognized roles of FAK in neutrophil function and provided a potential therapeutic target for treatment of a variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases."
18391212,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Targeted liposomal delivery of TLR9 ligands activates spontaneous antitumor immunity in an autochthonous cancer model.,"Accessibility of tumors for highly effective local treatment represents a major challenge for anticancer therapy. Immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with CpG motifs are ligands of TLR9, which prime spontaneous antitumor immunity, but are less effective when applied systemically. We therefore developed a liposome-based agent for selective delivery of CpG-ODN into the tumor environment. A peptide that specifically targets angiogenic endothelial cells in a transgenic tumor model for islet cell carcinogenesis was engrafted into CpG-ODN containing liposomes. Intravenous injection of these liposomes resulted in specific accumulation around tumor vessels, increased uptake by tumor-resident macrophages, and retention over time. In contrast, nontargeted liposomes did not localize to the tumor vasculature. Consequently, only vascular targeting of CpG-ODN liposomes provoked a marked inflammatory response at vessel walls with enhanced CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell infiltration and, importantly, activation of spontaneous, tumor-specific cytotoxicity. In a therapeutic setting, 40% of tumor-bearing, transgenic mice survived beyond week 45 after systemic administration of vascular-directed CpG-ODN liposomes. In contrast, control mice survived up to 30 wk. Therapeutic efficacy was further improved by increasing the frequency of tumor-specific effector cells through adoptive transfers. NK cells and CD8(+) T cells were major effectors which induced tumor cell death and acted in conjunction with antivascular effects. Thus, tumor homing with CpG-ODN-loaded liposomes is as potent as direct injection of free CpG-ODN and has the potential to overcome some major limitations of conventional CpG-ODN monotherapy."
18391219,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,A matter of timing: unsynchronized antigen expression and antigen presentation diminish secondary T cell responses.,"Despite the low and short expression of secondary Ag, prime-boost immunizations using homologous or heterologous vectors are capable of amplifying memory CD8(+) T cells. This is mainly attributed to the rapid presentation of Ag by APCs and the high proliferative capacity of memory CD8(+) T cells. Nevertheless, certain viruses and vectors often require prolonged Ag presentation for optimal T cell priming, and the influence of such a prolonged presentation during secondary immune induction is not clear. To address this issue, we primed and boosted mice intradermally (i.d.) with plasmid DNA that was recently reported to require prolonged Ag presentation for maximal CD8(+) T cell priming. Although functional memory CD8(+) T cells were present in the mice after i.d. priming, the secondary CD8(+) T cell response elicited was limited and reached a similar level of that observed during priming. The initial levels of secondary Ag expressed in the boosted mice were sufficient to prime CD8(+) T cell response in naive hosts, suggesting that lower Ag load alone does not explain the limited secondary immune responses observed. Removal of the injection site 5 or 10 days after i.d. boosting immunization resulted in diminished Ag presentation and no expansion of memory CD8(+) T cells. In fact, Ag-presenting activity following boost occurred mainly two weeks postimmunization, a time when the Ag was no longer expressed in situ. These findings suggest that when the boosting vector triggers prolonged Ag presentation, the lack of synchronicity between Ag accessibility and Ag presentation limits secondary immune responses."
18391222,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,T cell responses in the absence of IFN-gamma exacerbate uterine infection with Chlamydia trachomatis.,"Infection with the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is controlled primarily by IFN-gamma and Th1 immunity. In this study, we used cells from a Chlamydia-specific CD4(+) TCR-transgenic mouse to assess the role of IFN-gamma in development of Th1 immunity. We show that secretion of host IFN-gamma or the ability of host cells to respond to secreted IFN-gamma is not required to initiate a Th1 immune response. Additionally, we found that Ag-specific CD4(+) cells that were preskewed toward Th1 confer protection, whereas cells preskewed toward Th2 cause a previously unreported exacerbation of disease leading to higher bacterial load. Chlamydia-specific Th1 cells transferred into an IFN-gamma(-/-) recipient mouse demonstrate protective effects, but the same cells exacerbate bacterial burden when transferred into IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice. Thus, we demonstrate that the secretion of IFN-gamma is necessary for protection against C. trachomatis and that in the absence of host cell IFN-gammaR expression, both Th1 and Th2 cells lead to increased burden of C. trachomatis."
18394558,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,TLR9 activation coupled to IL-10 deficiency induces adverse pregnancy outcomes.,"Pregnancy outcome is severely compromised by intrauterine infections and inflammation. Although the pregnant uterine microenvironment is replete with innate immune cells and TLR expression, the mechanisms that facilitate adverse effects of their activation are largely unknown. In this study, we mimic the activation of TLR9 with its pathogenic ligand hypomethylated CpG and demonstrate that IL-10 proficiency protects against CpG-induced pregnancy complications. We show that fetal resorption and preterm birth are rapidly induced in IL-10(-/-) mice by low doses of CpG (approximately 25 microg/mouse) when injected i.p. on gestational day 6 or gestational day 14, respectively. In contrast, wild-type mice failed to experience such effects at comparable doses, but pups born at term displayed craniofacial/limb defects in response to higher doses (approximately 400 microg/mouse). Pregnancy complications in IL-10(-/-) mice were associated with unexpected and robust TLR9-triggered activation and amplification of uterine neutrophil and macrophage subpopulations followed by their migration to the placental zone. Furthermore, a dramatic increase in serum levels of mouse KC and TNF-alpha production by uterine F4/80(+) cells, but not uterine NK or Gr-1(+)CD11b(+) cells, was observed. Depletion of F4/80(+) macrophages or neutralization of TNF-alpha rescued pregnancy to term. Our results have important implications for IL-10-mediated &quot;uterine tolerance&quot; against CpG-driven innate immune activation."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Suicidal membrane repair regulates phosphatidylserine externalization during apoptosis.,"One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner-to-outer plasma membrane (PM) leaflet, where it functions as a ligand for phagocyte recognition and the suppression of inflammatory responses. The mechanism by which apoptotic cells externalize PS has been assumed to involve &quot;scramblases&quot; that randomize phospholipids across the PM bilayer. These putative activities, however, have not been unequivocally proven to be responsible for the redistribution of lipids. Because elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) is critical to this process and is also required for activation of lysosome-PM fusion during membrane repair, we hypothesized that apoptosis could activate a &quot;pseudo&quot;-membrane repair response that results in the fusion of lysosomes with the PM. Using a membrane-specific probe that labels endosomes and lysosomes and fluorescein-labeled annexin 5 that labels PS, we show that the appearance of PS at the cell surface during apoptosis is dependent on the fusion of lysosomes with the PM, a process that is inhibited with the lysosomotrophe, chloroquine. We demonstrate that apoptotic cells evoke a persistent pseudo-membrane repair response that likely redistributes lysosomal-derived PS to the PM outer leaflet that leads to membrane expansion and the formation of apoptotic blebs. Our data suggest that inhibition of lysosome-PM fusion-dependent redistribution of PS that occurs as a result of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis will prevent PS-dependent anti-inflammatory responses that preclude the development of tumor- and patient-specific immune responses."
18400181,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Role of conserved salt bridges in homeodomain stability and DNA binding.,"The sequence information available for homeodomains reveals that salt bridges connecting pairs 19/30, 31/42, and 17/52 are frequent, whereas aliphatic residues at these sites are rare and mainly restricted to proteins from homeotherms. We have analyzed the influence of salt and hydrophobic bridges at these sites on the stability and DNA binding properties of human Hesx-1 homeodomain. Regarding the protein stability, our analysis shows that hydrophobic side chains are clearly preferred at positions 19/30 and 31/42. This stabilizing influence results from the more favorable packing of the aliphatic side chains with the protein core, as illustrated by the three-dimensional solution structure of a thermostable variant, herein reported. In contrast only polar side chains seem to be tolerated at positions 17/52. Interestingly, despite the significant influence of pairs 19/30 and 31/42 on the stability of the homeodomain, their effect on DNA binding ranges from modest to negligible. The observed lack of correlation between binding strength and conformational stability in the analyzed variants suggests that salt/hydrophobic bridges at these specific positions might have been employed by evolution to independently modulate both properties."

Commun.,372516,2009,FATP1 mediates fatty acid-induced activation of AMPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"Fatty acid transport proteins are integral membrane acyl-CoA synthetases implicated in adipocyte fatty acid influx and esterification. FATP-dependent production of AMP was evaluated using FATP4 proteoliposomes, and fatty acid-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was assessed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin-stimulated fatty acid influx (palmitate or arachidonate) into cultured adipocytes resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Consistent with the activation of AMPK, palmitate uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in an increase in intracellular [AMP]/[ATP]. The fatty acid-induced increase in AMPK activation was attenuated in a cell line expressing shRNA targeting FATP1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in adipocytes, insulin-stimulated fatty acid influx mediated by FATP1 regulates AMPK and provides a potential regulatory mechanism for balancing de novo production of fatty acids from glucose metabolism with influx of preformed fatty acids via phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
18404153,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Myocardial stunning is associated with impaired calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum.,"Myocardial stunning (temporary post-ischaemic contractile dysfunction) may be caused by oxidative stress and/or impaired myocyte calcium homeostasis. Regional myocardial stunning was induced in open-chest pigs (segment shortening reduced to 68.3+/-4.7% of baseline) by repetitive brief circumflex coronary occlusion (I/R). Reduced glutathione was depleted in stunned myocardium (1.34+/-0.06 vs. 1.77+/-0.11 nmol/mg, p=0.02 vs. remote myocardium) indicating regional oxidant stress, but no regional differences were observed in protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine or S-nitrosothiol content. Repetitive I/R did not affect myocardial quantities of the sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchanger, L-type channel, SR calcium ATPase and phospholamban, or the kinetics of ligand binding to L-type channels and SR calcium release channels. However, initial rates of oxalate-supported (45)Ca uptake by SR were impaired in stunned myocardium (41.3+/-13.5 vs. 73.0+/-15.6 nmol/min/mg protein, p=0.03). The ability of SR calcium ATPase to sequester cytosolic calcium is impaired in stunned myocardium. This is a potential mechanism underlying contractile dysfunction."
18405666,1,Immunity,9432918,2009,Suppression of interleukin-33 bioactivity through proteolysis by apoptotic caspases.,"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a member of the IL-1 family and is involved in polarization of T cells toward a T helper 2 (Th2) cell phenotype. IL-33 is thought to be activated via caspase-1-dependent proteolysis, similar to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18, but this remains unproven. Here we showed that IL-33 was processed by caspases activated during apoptosis (caspase-3 and -7) but was not a physiological substrate for caspases associated with inflammation (caspase-1, -4, and -5). Furthermore, caspase-dependent processing of IL-33 was not required for ST2 receptor binding or ST2-dependent activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Indeed, caspase-dependent proteolysis of IL-33 dramatically attenuated IL-33 bioactivity in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that IL-33 does not require proteolysis for activation, but rather, that IL-33 bioactivity is diminished through caspase-dependent proteolysis within apoptotic cells. Thus, caspase-mediated proteolysis acts as a switch to dampen the proinflammatory properties of IL-33."
18407841,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,ResBoost: characterizing and predicting catalytic residues in enzymes.,"BACKGROUND: Identifying the catalytic residues in enzymes can aid in understanding the molecular basis of an enzyme's function and has significant implications for designing new drugs, identifying genetic disorders, and engineering proteins with novel functions. Since experimentally determining catalytic sites is expensive, better computational methods for identifying catalytic residues are needed. RESULTS: We propose ResBoost, a new computational method to learn characteristics of catalytic residues. The method effectively selects and combines rules of thumb into a simple, easily interpretable logical expression that can be used for prediction. We formally define the rules of thumb that are often used to narrow the list of candidate residues, including residue evolutionary conservation, 3D clustering, solvent accessibility, and hydrophilicity. ResBoost builds on two methods from machine learning, the AdaBoost algorithm and Alternating Decision Trees, and provides precise control over the inherent trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated ResBoost using cross-validation on a dataset of 100 enzymes from the hand-curated Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA). CONCLUSION: ResBoost achieved 85% sensitivity for a 9.8% false positive rate and 73% sensitivity for a 5.7% false positive rate. ResBoost reduces the number of false positives by up to 56% compared to the use of evolutionary conservation scoring alone. We also illustrate the ability of ResBoost to identify recently validated catalytic residues not listed in the CSA."
18408009,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,An integrated strategy to study muscle development and myofilament structure in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"A crucial step in the development of muscle cells in all metazoan animals is the assembly and anchorage of the sarcomere, the essential repeat unit responsible for muscle contraction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, many of the critical proteins involved in this process have been uncovered through mutational screens focusing on uncoordinated movement and embryonic arrest phenotypes. We propose that additional sarcomeric proteins exist for which there is a less severe, or entirely different, mutant phenotype produced in their absence. We have used Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate a comprehensive profile of late embryonic muscle gene expression. We generated two replicate long SAGE libraries for sorted embryonic muscle cells, identifying 7,974 protein-coding genes. A refined list of 3,577 genes expressed in muscle cells was compiled from the overlap between our SAGE data and available microarray data. Using the genes in our refined list, we have performed two separate RNA interference (RNAi) screens to identify novel genes that play a role in sarcomere assembly and/or maintenance in either embryonic or adult muscle. To identify muscle defects in embryos, we screened specifically for the Pat embryonic arrest phenotype. To visualize muscle defects in adult animals, we fed dsRNA to worms producing a GFP-tagged myosin protein, thus allowing us to analyze their myofilament organization under gene knockdown conditions using fluorescence microscopy. By eliminating or severely reducing the expression of 3,300 genes using RNAi, we identified 122 genes necessary for proper myofilament organization, 108 of which are genes without a previously characterized role in muscle. Many of the genes affecting sarcomere integrity have human homologs for which little or nothing is known."
18408164,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,3D model of lamprey estrogen receptor with estradiol and 15alpha-hydroxy-estradiol.,"BACKGROUND: Lamprey, basal vertebrate, is an important model system for understanding early events in vertebrate evolution. Lamprey contains orthologs of the estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor and corticoid receptor. A perplexing property of lamprey is that 15alpha-hydroxy-steroids are active steroids. For example, 15alpha-hydroxy-estradiol [15alpha-OH-E2] is the estrogen, instead of estradiol [E2]. To investigate how 15alpha-OH-E2 binds lamprey ER, we constructed a 3D model of the lamprey ER with E2 and 15alpha-OH-E2. METHODOLOGY: We used the 3D structure of human ERalpha as a template to construct a 3D model of lamprey ER. E2 and 15alpha-OH-E2 were inserted into the 3D model of lamprey ER and 15alpha-OH-E2 was inserted into human ERalpha. Then the each steroid-protein complex was refined using Discover 3 from Insight II software. To determine if lamprey ER had some regions that were unique among vertebrate ERs, we used the ligand-binding domain of lamprey ER as a query for a BLAST search of GenBank. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our 3D model of lamprey ER with 15alpha-OH-E2 shows that Sdelta on Met-409 can form a hydrogen bond with the 15alpha-hydroxyl on 15alpha-OH-E2. In human ERalpha, the corresponding residue Ile-424 has a van der Waals contact with 15alpha-OH-E2. BLAST analysis of GenBank indicates that among vertebrate ERs, only lamprey ER contains a methionine at this position. Thus, the contact between Sdelta on Met-409 and 15alpha-OH-E2 is unique. Interestingly, BLAST finds that five New World monkeys and a sturgeon contain a valine instead of isoleucine. SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to shedding light on the structure of the ER in a basal vertebrate, our 3D model of lamprey ER should prove useful in virtual screening of chemical libraries to identify compounds for controlling reproduction in sea lamprey, an environmental pest in Lake Michigan."
18413597,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Competition triggers plasmid-mediated enhancement of substrate utilisation in Pseudomonas putida.,"Competition between species plays a central role in the activity and structure of communities. Stable co-existence of diverse organisms in communities is thought to be fostered by individual tradeoffs and optimization of competitive strategies along resource gradients. Outside the laboratory, microbes exist as multispecies consortia, continuously interacting with one another and the environment. Survival and proliferation of a particular species is governed by its competitive fitness. Therefore, bacteria must be able to continuously sense their immediate environs for presence of competitors and prevailing conditions. Here we present results of our investigations on a novel competition sensing mechanism in the rhizosphere-inhabiting Pseudomonas putida KT2440, harbouring gfpmut3b-modified Kan(R) TOL plasmid. We monitored benzyl alcohol (BA) degradation rate, along with GFP expression profiling in mono species and dual species cultures. Interestingly, enhanced plasmid expression (monitored using GFP expression) and consequent BA degradation were observed in dual species consortia, irrespective of whether the competitor was a BA degrader (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or a non-degrader (E. coli). Attempts at elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of induction indicated the role of physical interaction, but not of any diffusible compounds emanating from the competitors. This contention is supported by the observation that greater induction took place in presence of increasing number of competitors. Inert microspheres mimicking competitor cell size and concentration did not elicit any significant induction, further suggesting the role of physical cell-cell interaction. Furthermore, it was also established that cell wall compromised competitor had minimal induction capability. We conclude that P. putida harbouring pWW0 experience a competitive stress when grown as dual-species consortium, irrespective of the counterpart being BA degrader or not. The immediate effect of this stress is a marked increase in expression of TOL, leading to rapid utilization of the available carbon source and massive increase in its population density. The plausible mechanisms behind the phenomenon are hypothesised and practical implications are indicated and discussed."
18413607,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Bacterial antigen expression is an important component in inducing an immune response to orally administered Salmonella-delivered DNA vaccines.,"BACKGROUND: The use of Salmonella to deliver heterologous antigens from DNA vaccines is a well-accepted extension of the success of oral Salmonella vaccines in animal models. Attenuated S. typhimurium and S. typhi strains are safe and efficacious, and their use to deliver DNA vaccines combines the advantages of both vaccine approaches, while complementing the limitations of each technology. An important aspect of the basic biology of the Salmonella/DNA vaccine platform is the relative contributions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression in production of the vaccine antigen. Gene expression in DNA vaccines is commonly under the control of the eukaryotic cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The aim of this study was to identify and disable putative bacterial promoters within the CMV promoter and evaluate the immunogenicity of the resulting DNA vaccine delivered orally by S. typhimurium. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results reported here clearly demonstrate the presence of bacterial promoters within the CMV promoter. These promoters have homology to the bacterial consensus sequence and functional activity. To disable prokaryotic expression from the CMV promoter a series of genetic manipulations were performed to remove the two major bacterial promoters and add a bacteria transcription terminator downstream of the CMV promoter. S. typhimurium was used to immunise BALB/c mice orally with a DNA vaccine encoding the C-fragment of tetanus toxin (TT) under control of the original or the modified CMV promoter. Although both promoters functioned equally well in eukaryotic cells, as indicated by equivalent immune responses following intramuscular delivery, only the original CMV promoter was able to induce an anti-TT specific response following oral delivery by S. typhimurium. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that prokaryotic expression of the antigen and co-delivery of this protein by Salmonella are at least partially responsible for the successful oral delivery of C-fragment DNA vaccines containing the CMV promoter by S. typhimurium."
18418388,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Structure and function of a complex between chorismate mutase and DAHP synthase: efficiency boost for the junior partner.,"Chorismate mutase catalyzes a key step in the shikimate biosynthetic pathway towards phenylalanine and tyrosine. Curiously, the intracellular chorismate mutase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtCM; Rv0948c) has poor activity and lacks prominent active-site residues. However, its catalytic efficiency increases &gt;100-fold on addition of DAHP synthase (MtDS; Rv2178c), another shikimate-pathway enzyme. The 2.35 A crystal structure of the MtCM-MtDS complex bound to a transition-state analogue shows a central core formed by four MtDS subunits sandwiched between two MtCM dimers. Structural comparisons imply catalytic activation to be a consequence of the repositioning of MtCM active-site residues on binding to MtDS. The mutagenesis of the C-terminal extrusion of MtCM establishes conserved residues as part of the activation machinery. The chorismate-mutase activity of the complex, but not of MtCM alone, is inhibited synergistically by phenylalanine and tyrosine. The complex formation thus endows the shikimate pathway of M. tuberculosis with an important regulatory feature. Experimental evidence suggests that such non-covalent enzyme complexes comprising an AroQ(delta) subclass chorismate mutase like MtCM are abundant in the bacterial order Actinomycetales."
18418389,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Hypertension of Kcnmb1-/- is linked to deficient K secretion and aldosteronism.,"Mice lacking the beta1-subunit (gene, Kcnmb1; protein, BK-beta1) of the large Ca-activated K channel (BK) are hypertensive. This phenotype is thought to result from diminished BK currents in vascular smooth muscle where BK-beta1 is an ancillary subunit. However, the beta1-subunit is also expressed in the renal connecting tubule (CNT), a segment of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, where it associates with BK and facilitates K secretion. Because of the correlation between certain forms of hypertension and renal defects, particularly in the distal nephron, it was determined whether the hypertension of Kcnmb1(-/-) has a renal origin. We found that Kcnmb1(-/-) are hypertensive, volume expanded, and have reduced urinary K and Na clearances. These conditions are exacerbated when the animals are fed a high K diet (5% K; HK). Supplementing HK-fed Kcnmb1(-/-) with eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) corrected the fluid imbalance and more than 70% of the hypertension. Finally, plasma [aldo] was elevated in Kcnmb1(-/-) under basal conditions (control diet, 0.6% K) and increased significantly more than wild type when fed the HK diet. We conclude that the majority of the hypertension of Kcnmb1(-/-) is due to aldosteronism, resulting from renal potassium retention and hyperkalemia."
18420585,1,Science,404511,2009,Solution nuclear magnetic resonance structure of membrane-integral diacylglycerol kinase.,"Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) represents a family of integral membrane enzymes that is unrelated to all other phosphotransferases. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the DAGK homotrimer with the use of solution nuclear magnetic resonance. The third transmembrane helix from each subunit is domain-swapped with the first and second transmembrane segments from an adjacent subunit. Each of DAGK's three active sites resembles a portico. The cornice of the portico appears to be the determinant of DAGK's lipid substrate specificity and overhangs the site of phosphoryl transfer near the water-membrane interface. Mutations to cysteine that caused severe misfolding were located in or near the active site, indicating a high degree of overlap between sites responsible for folding and for catalysis."
18420823,1,Science,404511,2009,Genomic footprints of a cryptic plastid endosymbiosis in diatoms.,"Diatoms and other chromalveolates are among the dominant phytoplankters in the world's oceans. Endosymbiosis was essential to the success of chromalveolates, and it appears that the ancestral plastid in this group had a red algal origin via an ancient secondary endosymbiosis. However, recent analyses have turned up a handful of nuclear genes in chromalveolates that are of green algal derivation. Using a genome-wide approach to estimate the &quot;green&quot; contribution to diatoms, we identified &gt;1700 green gene transfers, constituting 16% of the diatom nuclear coding potential. These genes were probably introduced into diatoms and other chromalveolates from a cryptic endosymbiont related to prasinophyte-like green algae. Chromalveolates appear to have recruited genes from the two major existing algal groups to forge a highly successful, species-rich protist lineage."
18423204,1,Science,404511,2009,Mitochondrial STAT3 supports Ras-dependent oncogenic transformation.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor responsive to cytokine signaling and tyrosine kinase oncoproteins by nuclear translocation when it is tyrosine-phosphorylated. We report that malignant transformation by activated Ras is impaired without STAT3, in spite of the inability of Ras to drive STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Moreover, STAT3 mutants that cannot be tyrosine-phosphorylated, that are retained in the cytoplasm, or that cannot bind DNA nonetheless supported Ras-mediated transformation. Unexpectedly, STAT3 was detected within mitochondria, and exclusive targeting of STAT3 to mitochondria without nuclear accumulation facilitated Ras transformation. Mitochondrial STAT3 sustained altered glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation activities characteristic of cancer cells. Thus, in addition to its nuclear transcriptional role, STAT3 regulates a metabolic function in mitochondria, supporting Ras-dependent malignant transformation."
18427106,1,Science,404511,2009,High-resolution NMR in magnetic fields with unknown spatiotemporal variations.,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are usually carried out in homogeneous magnetic fields. In many cases, however, high-resolution spectra are virtually impossible to obtain because of the inherent heterogeneity of the samples or living organisms under investigation, as well as the poor homogeneity of the magnets (particularly when bulky samples must be placed outside their bores). Unstable power supplies and vibrations arising from cooling can lead to field fluctuations in time as well as space. We show how high-resolution NMR spectra can be obtained in inhomogeneous fields with unknown spatiotemporal variations. Our method, based on coherence transfer between spins, can accommodate spatial inhomogeneities of at least 11 gauss per centimeter and temporal fluctuations slower than 2 hertz."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Nucleophile generation via decarboxylation: asymmetric construction of contiguous trisubstituted and quaternary stereocenters through a Cu(I)-catalyzed decarboxylative Mannich-type reaction.,"The first catalytic asymmetric decarboxylative Mannich-type reaction between aldimines and cyanocarboxylic acids was developed. Alpha,alpha,beta-trisubstituted beta-amino nitriles containing contiguous trisubstituted and all-carbon quaternary stereocenters were produced with moderate to high enantio- and diastereoselectivity using 5 mol % CuOAc-(R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS complex as an asymmetric catalyst. This reaction proceeds through Cu(I)-catalyzed decarboxylative nucleophile generation followed by the addition of the resulting chiral Cu ketenimide to imines. Because the reaction proceeds under very mild conditions at nearly neutral pH, the reaction is applicable to a wide range of substrate combinations, including both aromatic and aliphatic imines. The products were converted to beta(2,2,3)-amino acid derivatives through simple acidic hydrolysis without any racemization or epimerization. Therefore, this is a general catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of beta(2,2,3)-amino acid derivatives, a group of important chiral building blocks for pharmaceutical lead compounds."
18430226,1,Nature,410462,2009,A reevaluation of X-irradiation-induced phocomelia and proximodistal limb patterning.,"Phocomelia is a devastating, rare congenital limb malformation in which the long bones are shorter than normal, with the upper portion of the limb being most severely affected. In extreme cases, the hands or fingers are attached directly to the shoulder and the most proximal elements (those closest to the shoulder) are entirely missing. This disorder, previously known in both autosomal recessive and sporadic forms, showed a marked increase in incidence in the early 1960s due to the tragic toxicological effects of the drug thalidomide, which had been prescribed as a mild sedative. This human birth defect is mimicked in developing chick limb buds exposed to X-irradiation. Both X-irradiation and thalidomide-induced phocomelia have been interpreted as patterning defects in the context of the progress zone model, which states that a cell's proximodistal identity is determined by the length of time spent in a distal limb region termed the 'progress zone'. Indeed, studies of X-irradiation-induced phocomelia have served as one of the two major experimental lines of evidence supporting the validity of the progress zone model. Here, using a combination of molecular analysis and lineage tracing in chick, we show that X-irradiation-induced phocomelia is fundamentally not a patterning defect, but rather results from a time-dependent loss of skeletal progenitors. Because skeletal condensation proceeds from the shoulder to fingers (in a proximal to distal direction), the proximal elements are differentially affected in limb buds exposed to radiation at early stages. This conclusion changes the framework for considering the effect of thalidomide and other forms of phocomelia, suggesting the possibility that the aetiology lies not in a defect in the patterning process, but rather in progenitor cell survival and differentiation. Moreover, molecular evidence that proximodistal patterning is unaffected after X-irradiation does not support the predictions of the progress zone model."
18430956,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,IL-17 and IFN-gamma mediate the elicitation of contact hypersensitivity responses by different mechanisms and both are required for optimal responses.,"Hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in the skin is a delayed type cellular immune response that can be mediated by CD8(+) T cells that produce IFN-gamma or IL-17. However, mechanisms for these cytokines in the elicitation of CHS remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we show that adoptive transfer of CHS with hapten-primed wild-type (WT) CD8(+) T cells is reduced in IFN-gammaR(-/-) or IL-17R(-/-) mice compared with WT controls. The infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages in the hapten challenged skin of IL-17R(-/-) recipients is significantly reduced whereas it is less affected in IFN-gammaR(-/-) recipients although CD8(+) T cell infiltration is inhibited in both recipients. In contrast, the activity of reactive oxidative species is significantly inhibited in IFN-gammaR(-/-) but is less affected in IL-17R(-/-) recipients. Further analysis reveals that the expression of chemokines and cytokines is differentially regulated in the hapten-challenged skin of IFN-gammaR(-/-) or IL-17R(-/-) recipients compared with WT controls. Interestingly, injection of rIL-17 in the skin induces inflammation with a high level of leukocyte infiltration whereas injection of IFN-gamma induces inflammation with a high level of reactive oxidative species. Moreover, neutralization of IL-17 in IFN-gammaR(-/-) or IFN-gamma in IL-17R(-/-) mice further suppresses the adoptive transfer of CHS by hapten-primed WT CD8(+) T cells. The study demonstrates that IFN-gamma and IL-17 mediate the elicitation of CHS by different mechanisms and that both cytokines are required for optimal responses. This outcome improves understanding of pathogenesis and provides new insights into therapeutic strategies for CHS."
18434401,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Spatial pattern coding of sensory information by climbing fiber-evoked calcium signals in networks of neighboring cerebellar Purkinje cells.,"Climbing fiber input produces complex spike synchrony across populations of cerebellar Purkinje cells oriented in the parasagittal axis. Elucidating the fine spatial structure of this synchrony is crucial for understanding its role in the encoding and processing of sensory information within the olivocerebellar cortical circuit. We investigated these issues using in vivo multineuron two-photon calcium imaging in combination with information theoretic analysis. Spontaneous dendritic calcium transients linked to climbing fiber input were observed in multiple neighboring Purkinje cells. Spontaneous synchrony of calcium transients between individual Purkinje cells falls off over approximately 200 microm mediolaterally, consistent with the presence of cerebellar microzones organized by climbing fiber input. Synchrony was increased after administration of harmaline, consistent with an olivary origin. Periodic sensory stimulation also resulted in a transient increase of synchrony after stimulus onset. To examine how synchrony affects the neural population code provided by the spatial pattern of complex spikes, we analyzed its information content. We found that spatial patterns of calcium events from small ensembles of cells provided substantially more stimulus information (59% more for seven-cell ensembles) than available by counting events across the pool without taking into account spatial origin. Information theoretic analysis indicated that, rather than contributing significantly to sensory coding via stimulus dependence, correlational effects on sensory coding are dominated by redundancy attributable to the prevalent spontaneous synchrony. The olivocerebellar circuit thus uses a labeled line code to report sensory signals, leaving open a role for synchrony in flexible selection of signals for output to deep cerebellar nuclei."
18434540,1,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,Dormancy-associated MADS genes from the EVG locus of peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] have distinct seasonal and photoperiodic expression patterns.,"Mapping and sequencing of the non-dormant evg mutant in peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] identified six tandem-arrayed DAM (dormancy-associated MADS-box) genes as candidates for regulating growth cessation and terminal bud formation. To narrow the list of candidate genes, an attempt was made to associate bud phenology with the seasonal and environmental patterns of expression of the candidates in wild-type trees. The expression of the six peach DAM genes at the EVG locus of peach was characterized throughout an annual growing cycle in the field, and under controlled conditions in response to a long day-short day photoperiod transition. DAM1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were responsive to a reduction in photoperiod in controlled conditions and the direction of response correlated with the seasonal timing of expression in field-grown trees. DAM3 did not respond to photoperiod and may be regulated by chilling temperatures. The DAM genes in peach appear to have at least four distinct patterns of expression. DAM1, 2, and 4 are temporally associated with seasonal elongation cessation and bud formation and are the most likely candidates for control of the evg phenotype."
18434552,1,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,Identification of leaf proteins differentially accumulated during cold acclimation between Festuca pratensis plants with distinct levels of frost tolerance.,"Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) as the most frost-tolerant species within the Lolium-Festuca complex was used as a model for research aimed at identifying the cellular components involved in the cold acclimation (CA) of forage grasses. The work presented here also comprises the first comprehensive proteomic research on CA in a group of monocotyledonous species which are able to withstand winter conditions. Individual F. pratensis plants with contrasting levels of frost tolerance, high frost tolerant (HFT) and low frost tolerant (LFT) plants, were selected for comparative proteomic research. The work focused on the analysis of leaf protein accumulation before and after 2, 8, and 26 h, and 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 d of CA, using high-throughput two-dimensional electrophoresis, and on the identification of proteins which were accumulated differentially between the selected plants by the application of mass spectrometry. The analyses of approximately 800 protein profiles revealed a total of 41 (5.1%) proteins that showed a minimum of a 1.5-fold difference in abundance, at a minimum of one time point of CA for HFT and LFT genotypes. It was shown that significant differences in profiles of protein accumulation between the analysed plants appeared relatively early during cold acclimation, most often after 26 h (on the 2nd day) of CA and one-half of the differentially accumulated proteins were all parts of the photosynthetic apparatus. Several proteins identified here have been reported to be differentially accumulated during cold conditions for the first time in this paper. The functions of the selected proteins in plant cells and their probable influence on the level of frost tolerance in F. pratensis, are discussed."
18436640,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,gp340 promotes transcytosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in genital tract-derived cell lines and primary endocervical tissue.,"The human scavenger receptor gp340 has been identified as a binding protein for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope that is expressed on the cell surface of female genital tract epithelial cells. This interaction allows such epithelial cells to efficiently transmit infective virus to susceptible targets and maintain viral infectivity for several days. Within the context of vaginal transmission, HIV must first traverse a normally protective mucosa containing a cell barrier to reach the underlying T cells and dendritic cells, which propagate and spread the infection. The mechanism by which HIV-1 can bypass an otherwise healthy cellular barrier remains an important area of study. Here, we demonstrate that genital tract-derived cell lines and primary human endocervical tissue can support direct transcytosis of cell-free virus from the apical to basolateral surfaces. Further, this transport of virus can be blocked through the addition of antibodies or peptides that directly block the interaction of gp340 with the HIV-1 envelope, if added prior to viral pulsing on the apical side of the cell or tissue barrier. Our data support a role for the previously described heparan sulfate moieties in mediating this transcytosis but add gp340 as an important facilitator of HIV-1 transcytosis across genital tract tissue. This study demonstrates that HIV-1 actively traverses the protective barriers of the human genital tract and presents a second mechanism whereby gp340 can promote heterosexual transmission."

J.,2984726R,2009,Function and regulation of phospholipid signalling in plants.,"As an important metabolic pathway, phosphatidylinositol metabolism generates both constitutive and signalling molecules that are crucial for plant growth and development. Recent studies using genetic and molecular approaches reveal the important roles of phospholipid molecules and signalling in multiple processes of higher plants, including root growth, pollen and vascular development, hormone effects and cell responses to environmental stimuli plants. The present review summarizes the current progress in our understanding of the functional mechanism of phospholipid signalling, with an emphasis on the regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3-Ca2+ oscillation, the second messenger molecule phosphatidic acid and the cytoskeleton."
18436649,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,"The Mycoplasma conjunctivae genome sequencing, annotation and analysis.","BACKGROUND: The mollicute Mycoplasma conjunctivae is the etiological agent leading to infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) in domestic sheep and wild caprinae. Although this pathogen is relatively benign for domestic animals treated by antibiotics, it can lead wild animals to blindness and death. This is a major cause of death in the protected species in the Alps (e.g., Capra ibex, Rupicapra rupicapra). METHODS: The genome was sequenced using a combined technique of GS-FLX (454) and Sanger sequencing, and annotated by an automatic pipeline that we designed using several tools interconnected via PERL scripts. The resulting annotations are stored in a MySQL database. RESULTS: The annotated sequence is deposited in the EMBL database (FM864216) and uploaded into the mollicutes database MolliGen http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/molligen/ allowing for comparative genomics. CONCLUSION: We show that our automatic pipeline allows for annotating a complete mycoplasma genome and present several examples of analysis in search for biological targets (e.g., pathogenic proteins)."
18443286,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Annotation and visualization of endogenous retroviral sequences using the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) and eBioX.,"BACKGROUND: The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) is a widely used network protocol for sharing biological information. The distributed aspects of the protocol enable the use of various reference and annotation servers for connecting biological sequence data to pertinent annotations in order to depict an integrated view of the data for the final user. RESULTS: An annotation server has been devised to provide information about the endogenous retroviruses detected and annotated by a specialized in silico tool called RetroTector. We describe the procedure to implement the DAS 1.5 protocol commands necessary for constructing the DAS annotation server. We use our server to exemplify those steps. Data distribution is kept separated from visualization which is carried out by eBioX, an easy to use open source program incorporating multiple bioinformatics utilities. Some well characterized endogenous retroviruses are shown in two different DAS clients. A rapid analysis of areas free from retroviral insertions could be facilitated by our annotations. CONCLUSION: The DAS protocol has shown to be advantageous in the distribution of endogenous retrovirus data. The distributed nature of the protocol is also found to aid in combining annotation and visualization along a genome in order to enhance the understanding of ERV contribution to its evolution. Reference and annotation servers are conjointly used by eBioX to provide visualization of ERV annotations as well as other data sources. Our DAS data source can be found in the central public DAS service repository, http://www.dasregistry.org, or at http://loka.bmc.uu.se/das/sources."

18445650,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Lutein accumulation in the absence of zeaxanthin restores nonphotochemical quenching in the Arabidopsis thaliana npq1 mutant.,"Plants protect themselves from excess absorbed light energy through thermal dissipation, which is measured as nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). The major component of NPQ, qE, is induced by high transthylakoid DeltapH in excess light and depends on the xanthophyll cycle, in which violaxanthin and antheraxanthin are deepoxidized to form zeaxanthin. To investigate the xanthophyll dependence of qE, we identified suppressor of zeaxanthin-less1 (szl1) as a suppressor of the Arabidopsis thaliana npq1 mutant, which lacks zeaxanthin. szl1 npq1 plants have a partially restored qE but lack zeaxanthin and have low levels of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and neoxanthin. However, they accumulate more lutein and alpha-carotene than the wild type. szl1 contains a point mutation in the lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) gene. Based on the pigment analysis, LCYB appears to be the major lycopene beta-cyclase and is not involved in neoxanthin synthesis. The Lhcb4 (CP29) and Lhcb5 (CP26) protein levels are reduced by 50% in szl1 npq1 relative to the wild type, whereas other Lhcb proteins are present at wild-type levels. Analysis of carotenoid radical cation formation and leaf absorbance changes strongly suggest that the higher amount of lutein substitutes for zeaxanthin in qE, implying a direct role in qE, as well as a mechanism that is weakly sensitive to carotenoid structural properties."
18445651,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Insulin-like growth factor-II methylation status in lymphocyte DNA and colon cancer risk in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease cohort.,"Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) gene is a frequent phenomenon in colorectal tumor tissues. Previous reports indicated that subjects with colorectal neoplasias show LOI of IGFII in circulating lymphocytes. Furthermore, LOI of IGFII is strongly related to the methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) in intron 2 of IGFII, suggesting that the methylation status could serve as a biomarker for early detection. Thus, hypermethylation of this DMR, even at a systemic level, e.g., in lymphocyte DNA, could be used for screening for colon cancer. To validate this, we performed a case-control study of 97 colon cancer cases and 190 age-matched and gender-matched controls, nested within the prospective Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study cohort. Methylation levels of the IGFII-DMR in lymphocyte DNA were measured at two specific CpG sites of the IGFII-DMR using a mass-spectrometric method called short oligonucleotide mass analysis, the measurements of which showed high reproducibility between replicate measurements for the two CpG sites combined and showed almost perfect validity when performed on variable mixtures of methylated and unmethylated standards. Mean fractions of CpG methylation, for the two CpG sites combined, were identical for cases and controls (0.47 and 0.46, respectively; P(difference) = 0.75), and logistic regression analyses showed no relationship between colon cancer risk and quartile levels of CpG methylation. The results from this study population do not support the hypothesis that colon cancer can be predicted from the different degrees of methylation of DMR in the IGFII gene from lymphocyte DNA."
18445652,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Expression of WSX1 in tumors sensitizes IL-27 signaling-independent natural killer cell surveillance.,"It is well known that the interleukin (IL)-27 receptor WSX1 is expressed in immune cells and induces an IL-27-dependent immune response. Opposing this conventional dogma, this study reveals a much higher level of WSX1 expression in multiple types of epithelial tumor cells when compared with normal epithelial cells. Expression of exogenous WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells suppresses tumorigenicity in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Different from the role of WSX1 in immune cells, the antitumor activity of WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells is independent of IL-27 signaling but is mainly dependent on natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. Deficiency of either the IL-27 subunit EBV-induced gene 3 or the IL-27 receptor WSX1 in the host animals had no effect on tumor growth inhibition induced by WSX1 expression in tumor cells. Expression of WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells enhances NK cell cytolytic activity against tumor cells, whereas the absence of functional NK cells impairs the WSX1-mediated inhibition of epithelial tumor growth. The underlying mechanism by which WSX1 expression in tumor cells enhances NK cytolytic activity is dependent on up-regulation of NKG2D ligand expression. Our results reveal an IL-27-independent function of WSX1: sensitizing NK cell-mediated antitumor surveillance via a NKG2D-dependent mechanism."
18448676,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,A ruthenium-containing organometallic compound reduces tumor growth through induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress gene CHOP.,"Cisplatin-derived anticancer therapy has been used for three decades despite its side effects. Other types of organometallic complexes, namely, some ruthenium-derived compounds (RDC), which would display cytotoxicity through different modes of action, might represent alternative therapeutic agents. We have studied both in vitro and in vivo the biological properties of RDC11, one of the most active compounds of a new class of RDCs that contain a covalent bond between the ruthenium atom and a carbon. We showed that RDC11 inhibited the growth of various tumors implanted in mice more efficiently than cisplatin. Importantly, in striking contrast with cisplatin, RDC11 did not cause severe side effects on the liver, kidneys, or the neuronal sensory system. We analyzed the mode of action of RDC11 and showed that RDC11 interacted poorly with DNA and induced only limited DNA damages compared with cisplatin, suggesting alternative transduction pathways. Indeed, we found that target genes of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, such as Bip, XBP1, PDI, and CHOP, were activated in RDC11-treated cells. Induction of the transcription factor CHOP, a crucial mediator of endoplasmic reticulum stress apoptosis, was also confirmed in tumors treated with RDC11. Activation of CHOP led to the expression of several of its target genes, including proapoptotic genes. In addition, the silencing of CHOP by RNA interference significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of RDC11. Altogether, our results led us to conclude that RDC11 acts by an atypical pathway involving CHOP and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and thus might provide an interesting alternative for anticancer therapy."
18448684,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,MDA-MB-435 and M14 cell lines: identical but not M14 melanoma?,"A controversy has arisen over the past several years about the true origin of the human MDA-MB-435 cell line. Originally described as a human breast cancer cell line, subsequent expression array studies instead suggested a gene expression profile consistent with a melanoma origin. Subsequent karyotype and comparative genomic hybridization studies supported the idea that current stocks of both MDA-MB-435 cells and M14 melanoma cells must be identical cell lines, and the conclusion was drawn that both cell lines were in fact M14 melanoma cells. However, an alternate conclusion based on these data is that both cell lines are indeed identical, but are in fact MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. There is evidence that many cell lines can display &quot;lineage infidelity&quot; and that assignment to tissue type is unreliably made based on expression patterns. Evidence from the literature is presented here that is inconsistent with both lines being of M14 melanoma origin, but rather is consistent with both cell lines being of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer origin."

Recent excavations at Dhra' near the Dead Sea in Jordan provide strong evidence for sophisticated, purpose-built granaries in a predomestication context approximately 11,300-11,175 cal B.P., which support recent arguments for the deliberate cultivation of wild cereals at this time. Designed with suspended floors for air circulation and protection from rodents, they are located between residential structures that contain plant-processing instillations. The granaries represent a critical evolutionary shift in the relationship between people and plant foods, which precedes the emergence of domestication and large-scale sedentary communities by at least 1,000 years."
18451032,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Evidence for electronic gap-driven metal-semiconductor transition in phase-change materials.,"Phase-change materials are functionally important materials that can be thermally interconverted between metallic (crystalline) and semiconducting (amorphous) phases on a very short time scale. Although the interconversion appears to involve a change in local atomic coordination numbers, the electronic basis for this process is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in a nearly vacancy-free binary GeSb system where we can drive the phase change both thermally and, as we discover, by pressure, the transformation into the amorphous phase is electronic in origin. Correlations between conductivity, total system energy, and local atomic coordination revealed by experiments and long time ab initio simulations show that the structural reorganization into the amorphous state is driven by opening of an energy gap in the electronic density of states. The electronic driving force behind the phase change has the potential to change the interconversion paradigm in this material class."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Oxidoreductase activity of oligosaccharyltransferase subunits Ost3p and Ost6p defines site-specific glycosylation efficiency.,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification of diverse secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotes, where it is catalyzed by the multiprotein complex oligosaccharyltransferase. The functions of the protein subunits of oligoasccharyltransferase, apart from the catalytic Stt3p, are ill defined. Here we describe functional and structural investigations of the Ost3/6p components of the yeast enzyme. Genetic, biochemical and structural analyses of the lumenal domain of Ost6p revealed oxidoreductase activity mediated by a thioredoxin-like fold with a distinctive active-site loop that changed conformation with redox state. We found that mutation of the active-site cysteine residues of Ost6p and its paralogue Ost3p affected the glycosylation efficiency of a subset of glycosylation sites. Our results show that eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase is a multifunctional enzyme that acts at the crossroads of protein modification and protein folding."
18451879,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,The structure of alanyl-tRNA synthetase with editing domain.,"Alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) catalyzes synthesis of Ala-tRNA(Ala) and hydrolysis of mis-acylated Ser- and Gly-tRNA(Ala) at 2 different catalytic sites. Here, we describe the monomer structures of C-terminal truncated archaeal AlaRS, with both activation and editing domains in the apo form, in complex with an Ala-AMP analog, and in a high-resolution lysine-methylated form. The structures show docking of the editing domain to the activation domain opposite from the predicted tRNA-binding surface. Thus, the editing site is positioned &gt;35 A from the activation site, prompting us to model 2 different tRNA complexes: one binding tRNA at the activation site, and the other binding tRNA at the editing site. Interestingly, a gel-shift assay also implies the presence of 2 types of tRNA complex with different mobility. These results suggest that tRNA translocation via a canonical CCA flipping is unlikely to occur in AlaRS. The structure also demonstrated the binding of zinc in the editing site, in which the specific coordination of zinc would be facilitated by a conserved GGQ motif, implying that the editing mechanism may not be the same as in ThrRS. As Asn-194 in eubacterial AlaRS important for Ser misactivation is replaced by Thr-213 in archaeal AlaRS, a different Ser accommodation mechanism is proposed."
18451880,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Engineering synthetic adaptors and substrates for controlled ClpXP degradation.,"Facile control of targeted intracellular protein degradation has many potential uses in basic science and biotechnology. One promising approach to this goal is to redesign adaptor proteins, which can regulate proteolytic specificity by tethering substrates to energy-dependent AAA+ proteases. Using the ClpXP protease, we have probed the minimal biochemical functions required for adaptor function by designing and characterizing variant substrates, adaptors, and ClpX enzymes. We find that substrate tethering mediated by heterologous interaction domains and a small bridging molecule mimics substrate delivery by the wild-type system. These results show that simple tethering is sufficient for synthetic adaptor function. In our engineered system, tethering and proteolysis depend on the presence of the macrolide rapamycin, providing a foundation for engineering highly specific degradation of target proteins in cells. Importantly, this degradation is regulated by a small molecule without the need for new adaptor or enzyme biosynthesis."
18455122,1,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,Analysis of the human E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme protein interaction network.,"In eukaryotic cells the stability and function of many proteins are regulated by the addition of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like peptides. This process is dependent upon the sequential action of an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase. Different combinations of these proteins confer substrate specificity and the form of protein modification. However, combinatorial preferences within ubiquitination networks remain unclear. In this study, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were combined with true homology modeling methods to generate a high-density map of human E2/E3-RING interactions. These data include 535 experimentally defined novel E2/E3-RING interactions and &gt;1300 E2/E3-RING pairs with more favorable predicted free-energy values than the canonical UBE2L3-CBL complex. The significance of Y2H predictions was assessed by both mutagenesis and functional assays. Significantly, 74/80 (&gt;92%) of Y2H predicted complexes were disrupted by point mutations that inhibit verified E2/E3-RING interactions, and a approximately 93% correlation was observed between Y2H data and the functional activity of E2/E3-RING complexes in vitro. Analysis of the high-density human E2/E3-RING network reveals complex combinatorial interactions and a strong potential for functional redundancy, especially within E2 families that have undergone evolutionary expansion. Finally, a one-step extended human E2/E3-RING network, containing 2644 proteins and 5087 edges, was assembled to provide a resource for future functional investigations."

Soc.,7503056,2009,"Ion-exchangeable, electronically conducting layered perovskite oxyfluorides.","Cation-exchangeable d(0) layered perovskites are amenable to intercalation, exfoliation, and a variety of topochemical reactions, but they lack the interesting electronic and magnetic functionalities of mixed-valent perovskites. Conversely, electronically and magnetically interesting layered perovskites lack scope in terms of interlayer chemistry. To bridge this gap, the insulating, cation-exchangeable layered perovskites RbLaNb(2)O(7), KCa(2)Nb(3)O(10), and NaYTiO(4) were reacted with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) under inert atmosphere conditions to yield layer perovskites in which some of the oxygen is substituted by fluorine. In the fluorinated materials, the B-site cations are reduced to a mixed-valent state without introducing oxygen vacancies into the anion sublattice. The resulting electronically conducting solids can be exposed to air and water and even ion-exchanged in acid without oxidation of the B-site cations. Electronic transport measurements on the air-stable RbLaNb(2)O(6)F reveal room-temperature conductivity (2-7 x 10(2) ohms x cm) via a variable-range hopping mechanism, which is not substantially changed after aqueous proton exchange to H(1-x)Rb(x)LaNb(2)O(6)F (x approximately = 0.2)."
18455986,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Disassembly of shank and homer synaptic clusters is driven by soluble beta-amyloid(1-40) through divergent NMDAR-dependent signalling pathways.,"Disruption of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a network of scaffold proteins located in dendritic spines, is thought to be responsible for synaptic dysfunction and loss in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extending our previous demonstration that derangement of the PSD by soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) involves proteasomal degradation of PSD-95, a protein important for ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking, we now show that Abeta also disrupts two other scaffold proteins, Homer1b and Shank1, that couple PSD-95 with ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Treatment of fronto-cortical neurons with soluble Abeta results in rapid (within 1 h) and significant thinning of the PSD, decreased synaptic levels of Homer1b and Shank1, and reduced synaptic mGluR1 levels. We show that de novo protein synthesis is required for the declustering effects of Abeta on Homer1b (but not Shank1) and that, in contrast to PSD-95, Abeta-induced Homer1b and Shank1 cluster disassembly does not depend on proteasome activity. The regulation of Homer1b and Shank1 by Abeta diverges in two other respects: i) whereas the activity of both NMDAR and VDCC is required for Abeta-induced declustering of Homer1b, Abeta-induced declustering of Shank1 only requires NMDAR activity; and ii) whereas the effects of Abeta on Homer1b involve engagement of the PI-3K pathway and calcineurin phosphatase (PP2B) activity, those on Shank1 involve activation of the ERK pathway. In summary, soluble Abeta recruits discrete signalling pathways to rapidly reduce the synaptic localization of major components of the PSD and to regulate the availability of mGluR1 in the synapse."
18458331,1,Genetics,374636,2009,"Fork stalling and template switching as a mechanism for polyalanine tract expansion affecting the DYC mutant of HOXD13, a new murine model of synpolydactyly.","Polyalanine expansion diseases are proposed to result from unequal crossover of sister chromatids that increases the number of repeats. In this report we suggest an alternative mechanism we put forward while we investigated a new spontaneous mutant that we named &quot;Dyc&quot; for &quot;Digit in Y and Carpe&quot; phenotype. Phenotypic analysis revealed an abnormal limb patterning similar to that of the human inherited congenital disease synpolydactyly (SPD) and to the mouse mutant model Spdh. Both human SPD and mouse Spdh mutations affect the Hoxd13 gene within a 15-residue polyalanine-encoding repeat in the first exon of the gene, leading to a dominant negative HOXD13. Genetic analysis of the Dyc mutant revealed a trinucleotide expansion in the polyalanine-encoding region of the Hoxd13 gene resulting in a 7-alanine expansion. However, unlike the Spdh mutation, this expansion cannot result from a simple duplication of a short segment. Instead, we propose the fork stalling and template switching (FosTeS) described for generation of nonrecurrent genomic rearrangements as a possible mechanism for the Dyc polyalanine extension, as well as for other polyalanine expansions described in the literature and that could not be explained by unequal crossing over."
18458339,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,"ST14 (suppression of tumorigenicity 14) gene is a target for miR-27b, and the inhibitory effect of ST14 on cell growth is independent of miR-27b regulation.","MicroRNAs are noncoding, endogenous small RNAs that regulate target genes by cleavage of the targeted mRNA or translational repression. We investigated the microRNAome using 2-color microarrays in a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (subline 4175) and a noninvasive breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. We found 13 microRNAs that were up-regulated, and nine were down-regulated significantly in 4175 cells (p &lt; 0.05, -fold change &gt;2) compared with MCF10A cells. Interestingly, miR-27b and its putative target gene, ST14 (suppressor of tumorigenicity 14), had inverse expression pattern in breast cancer cells. The 3'-untranslated region of ST14 contains a regulatory element for miR-27b, and our luciferase experiments indicate that antisense miR-27b enhances ST14 expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, antagomir of miR-27b suppressed cell invasion in 4175 cells, whereas pre-miR-27b stimulated invasion in moderately invasive ZR75 breast cancer cells. In addition, ST14 reduces cell proliferation as well as cell migration and invasion. Analysis of human breast tumors revealed that miR-27b expression increases during cancer progression, paralleling a decrease in ST14 expression. Furthermore, our data indicate that ST14 inhibits cells from entering into S phase by up-regulating p27, which results in down-regulation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, suggesting ST14 reduces cell growth through its effects on cell cycle-related proteins. Introduction of miR-27b into ST14-expressing cells did not suppress the effect on cell growth. These findings suggest that ST14 plays an important role in several biological processes, and some effects are not completely dependent on miR-27b regulation."
18458342,1,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,Outer membrane protein expression profile in Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.,"The gram-negative gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is equipped with an extraordinarily large set of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), whose role in the infection process is not well understood. The Hop (Helicobacter outer membrane porins) and Hor (Hop-related proteins) groups constitute a large paralogous family consisting of 33 members. The OMPs AlpA, AlpB, BabA, SabA, and HopZ have been identified as adhesins or adherence-associated proteins. To better understand the relevance of these and other OMPs during infection, we analyzed the expression of eight different omp genes (alpA, alpB, babA, babB, babC, sabA, hopM, and oipA) in a set of 200 patient isolates, mostly from symptomatic children or young adults. Virtually all clinical isolates produced the AlpA and AlpB proteins, supporting their essential function. All other OMPs were produced at extremely variable rates, ranging from 35% to 73%, indicating a function in close adaptation to the individual host or gastric niche. In 11% of the isolates, BabA was produced, and SabA was produced in 5% of the isolates, but the strains failed to bind their cognate substrates. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in gastric cells was strictly dependent on the presence of the cag pathogenicity island, whereas the presence of OipA clearly enhanced IL-8 production. The presence of the translocated effector protein CagA correlated well with BabA and OipA production. In conclusion, we found unexpectedly diverse omp expression profiles in individual H. pylori strains and hypothesize that this reflects the selective pressure for adhesion, which may differ across different hosts as well as within an individual over time."

Human ECs were cultured in medium containing different concentrations of L-arginine until senescence. L-Arginine paradoxically accelerated senescence indicated by inhibiting telomerase activity. Moreover, L-arginine decreased NO metabolites, increased peroxynitrite, and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) formation. In old cells, the mRNA expression of human amino acid transporter (hCAT)2B, the activity and protein expression of arginase II were upregulated indicated by enhanced urea, L-ornithine, and L-arginine consumption. Inhibition of arginase activity, or transfection with arginase II siRNA prevented L-arginine-accelerated senescence. The most possible explanation for the paradoxical acceleration of senescence by L-arginine so far may be the translational and posttranslational activation of arginase II."

The vaccine was applied via spray-immunization to the tonsils of rhesus macaques and compared with systemic regimens. RESULTS: Independent of the application regimen or route, viral loads were significantly reduced after challenge with SIVmac239 (p &lt; 0.03) compared to controls. Considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies were induced in systemic immunized monkeys. Most of the sera harvested during peak viremia exhibited a trend with an inverse correlation between complement C3-deposition on viral particles and plasma viral load within the different vaccination groups. In contrast, the amount of the observed complement-mediated lysis did not correlate with the reduction of SIV titres. CONCLUSION: The heterologous prime-boost strategy with replication-deficient viral vectors administered exclusively via the tonsils did not induce any neutralizing antibodies before challenge. However, after challenge, comparable SIV-specific humoral immune responses were observed in all vaccinated animals. Immunization with single cycle immunodeficiency viruses mounts humoral immune responses comparable to live-attenuated immunodeficiency virus vaccines."
18462680,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,Recombinant production of eight human cytosolic aminotransferases and assessment of their potential involvement in glyoxylate metabolism.,"PH1 (primary hyperoxaluria type 1) is a severe inborn disorder of glyoxylate metabolism caused by a functional deficiency of the peroxisomal enzyme AGXT (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase), which converts glyoxylate into glycine using L-alanine as the amino-group donor. Even though pre-genomic studies indicate that other human transaminases can convert glyoxylate into glycine, in PH1 patients these enzymes are apparently unable to compensate for the lack of AGXT, perhaps due to their limited levels of expression, their localization in an inappropriate cell compartment or the scarcity of the required amino-group donor. In the present paper, we describe the cloning of eight human cytosolic aminotransferases, their recombinant expression as His6-tagged proteins and a comparative study on their ability to transaminate glyoxylate, using any standard amino acid as an amino-group donor. To selectively quantify the glycine formed, we have developed and validated an assay based on bacterial GO (glycine oxidase); this assay allows the detection of enzymes that produce glycine by transamination in the presence of mixtures of potential amino-group donors and without separation of the product from the substrates. We show that among the eight enzymes tested, only GPT (alanine transaminase) and PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase 1) can transaminate glyoxylate with good efficiency, using L-glutamate (and, for GPT, also L-alanine) as the best amino-group donor. These findings confirm that glyoxylate transamination can occur in the cytosol, in direct competition with the conversion of glyoxylate into oxalate. The potential implications for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria are discussed."

The placenta interacts directly with maternal uterine cells (decidual cells) but the physiological role of the decidua in the control of HIV-1 transmission and whether decidua could be a source of infected cells is unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To answer to this question, decidual mononuclear cells were exposed to HIV-1 in vitro. Decidual cells were shown to be more susceptible to infection by an R5 HIV-1, as compared to an X4 HIV-1. Infected cells were identified by flow cytometry analysis. The results showed that CD14(+) cells were the main targets of HIV-1 infection in the decidua. These infected CD14(+) cells expressed DC-SIGN, CD11b, CD11c, the Fc gamma receptor CD16, CD32 and CD64, classical MHC class-I and class-II and maturation and activation molecules CD83, CD80 and CD86. The permissivity of decidual tissue was also evaluated by histoculture. Decidual tissue was not infected by X4 HIV-1 but was permissive to R5 HIV-1. Different profiles of infection were observed depending on tissue localization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of HIV-1 target cells in the decidua in vitro and the low rate of in utero mother-to-child transmission during the first trimester of pregnancy suggest that a natural control occurs in vivo limiting cell-to-cell infection of the placenta and consequently infection of the fetus."
18463290,1,Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.,101186374,2009,Mode of VAMP substrate recognition and inhibition of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin F.,"Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cleave neuronal proteins responsible for neurotransmitter release, causing the neuroparalytic disease botulism. BoNT serotypes B, D, F and G cleave and inactivate vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), each at a unique peptide bond. The specificity of BoNTs depends on the mode of substrate recognition. We have investigated the mechanism of substrate recognition of BoNT F by determining the crystal structures of its complex with two substrate-based inhibitors, VAMP 22-58/Gln58D-cysteine and 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. The inhibitors bind to BoNT F in the canonical direction (as seen for BoNTs A and E substrates) but are positioned specifically via three major exosites away from the active site. The cysteine sulfur of the inhibitors interacts with the zinc and exists as sulfinic acid in the inhibitor VAMP 27-58/Gln58D-cysteine. Arg133 and Arg171, which form part of two separate exosites, are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis."
18463291,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Follicular dendritic cells activate HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages through a juxtacrine mechanism mediated by P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1.,"Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are located in the lymphoid follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues and play a pivotal role in the selection of memory B lymphocytes within the germinal center, a major site for HIV-1 infection. Germinal centers are composed of highly activated B cells, macrophages, CD4(+)T cells, and FDCs. However, the physiological role of FDCs in HIV-1 replication remains largely unknown. We demonstrate in our current study that FDCs can efficiently activate HIV-1 replication in latently infected monocytic cells via an intercellular communication network mediated by the P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) interaction. Upon coculture with FDCs, HIV-1 replication was significantly induced in infected monocytic cell lines, primary monocytes, or macrophages. These cocultures were found to synergistically induce the expression of P-selectin in FDCs via NF-kappaB activation and its cognate receptor PSGL-1 in HIV-1-infected cells. Consistent with this observation, we find that this response is significantly blocked by antagonistic Abs against PSGL-1 and almost completely inhibited by PSGL-1 small interfering RNA. Moreover, a selective inhibitor for Syk, which is a downstream effector of PSGL-1, blocked HIV-1 replication in our cultures. We have thus elucidated a novel regulatory mechanism in which FDCs are a potent positive bystander that facilitates HIV-1 replication in adjacent infected monocytic cells via a juxtacrine signaling mechanism."
18464795,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Gene expression profiling and real-time PCR analyses identify novel potential cancer-testis antigens in multiple myeloma.,"Cancer-testis (CT) Ags are attractive targets for immunotherapeutic strategies since they are aberrantly expressed in malignant cells and not, or in limited number, in somatic tissues, except germ cells. To identify novel CT genes in multiple myeloma, we used Affymetrix HG-U133 gene expression profiles of 5 testis, 64 primary multiple myeloma cells (MMC), and 24 normal tissue samples. A 5-filter method was developed to keep known CT genes while deleting non-CT genes. Starting from 44,928 probe sets, including probe sets for 18 previously described CT genes, we have obtained 82 genes expressed in MMC and testis and not detected in more than 6 normal tissue samples. This list includes 14 of the 18 known CT genes and 68 novel putative CT genes. Real-time RT-PCR was performed for 34 genes in 12 normal tissue samples, 5 MMC samples, and one sample of five pooled testes. It has validated the CT status of 23 of 34 genes (67%). We found one novel &quot;testis-restricted&quot; gene (TEX14, expression in testis and tumor only), eight &quot;tissue-restricted&quot; (mRNA detected in one or two nongametogenic tissues), and seven &quot;differentially expressed&quot; (mRNA detected in three to six nongametogenic tissues) CT genes. Further studies are warranted to determine the immunogenicity of these novel CT Ag candidates."
18467451,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Modulation of carcinogen metabolism by nitric oxide-aspirin 2 is associated with suppression of DNA damage and DNA adduct formation.,"Nitric oxide (NO)-donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent a promising new class of drugs developed to provide a safer alternative than their conventional NSAID counterparts in chemoprevention. We tested the effects of NO-aspirin 2 on Phase I and Phase II carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes. In HepG2 human hepatoma cells and in LS180 colonic adenocarcinoma cells, NO-aspirin 2 inhibited 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity and CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA expression. These effects were further characterized as being mediated through transcriptional regulation: NO-aspirin 2 inhibited binding of ligand (TCDD)-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor to the CYP1A1 enhancer sequence; additionally, NO-aspirin 2 suppressed carcinogen-induced expression of CYP1A heterogeneous nuclear RNA. The fate of carcinogen metabolites depends not only on activation by CYP enzymes but also detoxification by Phase II enzymes. Both HepG2 and LS180 cells treated with NO-aspirin 2 showed an increase in glutathione S-transferase-P1 (GST-P1), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) expression. Compared with two other NO-releasing compounds, diethylenetriamine-NO and the organic nitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, the inhibitory effects of NO-aspirin 2 on TCDD-induced CYP activity and mRNA expression were considerably more potent. Furthermore, aspirin alone had no inhibitory effect on TCDD-induced CYP activity, nor did aspirin up-regulate GCL, GST-P1, or NQO1 expression. Consequent to the effects on carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, NO-aspirin 2 inhibited [3H]benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct formation and DNA damage elicited by TCDD or benzo[a]pyrene. Our results demonstrate that NO-aspirin 2 may be an effective chemopreventive agent by favorably affecting the inhibitory and enhancing effects of Phase I and Phase II carcinogen metabolism, thereby protecting DNA from carcinogenic insult."
18467490,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,Loss of positive allosteric interactions between neuronal nitric oxide synthase and phosphofructokinase contributes to defects in glycolysis and increased fatigability in muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) involves a complex pathophysiology that is not easily explained by the loss of the protein dystrophin, the primary defect in DMD. Instead, many features of the pathology are attributable to the secondary loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from dystrophin-deficient muscle. In this investigation, we tested whether the loss of nNOS contributes to the increased fatigability of mdx mice, a model of DMD. Our findings show that the expression of a muscle-specific, nNOS transgene increases the endurance of mdx mice and enhances glycogen metabolism during treadmill-running, but did not affect vascular perfusion of muscles. We also find that the specific activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK; the rate limiting enzyme in glycolysis) is positively affected by nNOS in muscle; PFK-specific activity is significantly reduced in mdx muscles and the muscles of nNOS null mutants, but significantly increased in nNOS transgenic muscles and muscles from mdx mice that express the nNOS transgene. PFK activity measured under allosteric conditions was significantly increased by nNOS, but unaffected by endothelial NOS or inducible NOS. The specific domain of nNOS that positively regulates PFK activity was assayed by cloning and expressing different domains of nNOS and assaying their effects on PFK activity. This approach yielded a polypeptide that included the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain of nNOS as the region of the molecule that promotes PFK activity. Smaller peptides in this domain were then synthesized and used in activity assays that showed a 36-amino acid peptide in the FAD-binding domain in which most of the positive allosteric activity of nNOS for PFK resides. Mapping this peptide onto the structure of nNOS shows that the peptide is exposed on the surface, readily available for binding. Collectively, these findings indicate that defects in glycolytic metabolism and increased fatigability in dystrophic muscle may be caused in part by the loss of positive allosteric interactions between nNOS and PFK."
18467495,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,"MicroRNA-145, a novel smooth muscle cell phenotypic marker and modulator, controls vascular neointimal lesion formation.","Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases. Recently, we have found that microRNA (miRNA) miR-145 is the most abundant miRNA in normal vascular walls and in freshly isolated VSMCs; however, the role of miR-145 in VSMC phenotypic modulation and vascular diseases is currently unknown. Here we find that miR-145 is selectively expressed in VSMCs of the vascular wall and its expression is significantly downregulated in the vascular walls with neointimal lesion formation and in cultured dedifferentiated VSMCs. More importantly, both in cultured rat VSMCs in vitro and in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries in vivo, we demonstrate that the noncoding RNA miR-145 is a novel phenotypic marker and a novel phenotypic modulator of VSMCs. VSMC differentiation marker genes such as SM alpha-actin, calponin, and SM-MHC are upregulated by premiR-145 or adenovirus expressing miR-145 (Ad-miR-145) but are downregulated by the miR-145 inhibitor 2'OMe-miR-145. We have further identified that miR-145-mediated phenotypic modulation of VSMCs is through its target gene KLF5 and its downstream signaling molecule, myocardin. Finally, restoration of miR-145 in balloon-injured arteries via Ad-miR-145 inhibits neointimal growth. We conclude that miR-145 is a novel VSMC phenotypic marker and modulator that is able of controlling vascular neointimal lesion formation. These novel findings may have extensive implications for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases."
18467557,1,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,Circos: an information aesthetic for comparative genomics.,"We created a visualization tool called Circos to facilitate the identification and analysis of similarities and differences arising from comparisons of genomes. Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines."
18474855,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Identification of small gains and losses in single cells after whole genome amplification on tiling oligo arrays.,"Clinical DNA is often available in limited quantities requiring whole-genome amplification for subsequent genome-wide assessment of copy-number variation (CNV) by array-CGH. In pre-implantation diagnosis and analysis of micrometastases, even merely single cells are available for analysis. However, procedures allowing high-resolution analyses of CNVs from single cells well below resolution limits of conventional cytogenetics are lacking. Here, we applied amplification products of single cells and of cell pools (5 or 10 cells) from patients with developmental delay, cancer cell lines and polar bodies to various oligo tiling array platforms with a median probe spacing as high as 65 bp. Our high-resolution analyses reveal that the low amounts of template DNA do not result in a completely unbiased whole genome amplification but that stochastic amplification artifacts, which become more obvious on array platforms with tiling path resolution, cause significant noise. We implemented a new evaluation algorithm specifically for the identification of small gains and losses in such very noisy ratio profiles. Our data suggest that when assessed with sufficiently sensitive methods high-resolution oligo-arrays allow a reliable identification of CNVs as small as 500 kb in cell pools (5 or 10 cells), and of 2.6-3.0 Mb in single cells."
18474858,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Computing protein stabilities from their chain lengths.,"New amino acid sequences of proteins are being learned at a rapid rate, thanks to modern genomics. The native structures and functions of those proteins can often be inferred using bioinformatics methods. We show here that it is also possible to infer the stabilities and thermal folding properties of proteins, given only simple genomics information: the chain length and the numbers of charged side chains. In particular, our model predicts DeltaH(T), DeltaS(T), DeltaC(p), and DeltaF(T)--the folding enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and free energy--as functions of temperature T; the denaturant m values in guanidine and urea; the pH-temperature-salt phase diagrams, and the energy of confinement F(s) of the protein inside a cavity of radius s. All combinations of these phase equilibria can also then be computed from that information. As one illustration, we compute the pH and salt conditions that would denature a protein inside a small confined cavity. Because the model is analytical, it is computationally efficient enough that it could be used to automatically annotate whole proteomes with protein stability information."
18477694,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Oviposition preference for and positional avoidance of acetic acid provide a model for competing behavioral drives in Drosophila.,"Selection of appropriate oviposition sites is essential for progeny survival and fitness in generalist insect species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, yet little is known about the mechanisms regulating how environmental conditions and innate adult preferences are evaluated and balanced to yield the final substrate choice for egg-deposition. Female D. melanogaster are attracted to food containing acetic acid (AA) as an oviposition substrate. However, our observations reveal that this egg-laying preference is a complex process, as it directly opposes an otherwise strong, default behavior of positional avoidance for the same food. We show that 2 distinct sensory modalities detect AA. Attraction to AA-containing food for the purpose of egg-laying relies on the gustatory system, while positional repulsion depends primarily on the olfactory system. Similarly, distinct central brain regions are involved in AA attraction and repulsion. Given this unique situation, in which a single environmental stimulus yields 2 opposing behavioral outputs, we propose that the interaction of egg-laying attraction and positional aversion for AA provides a powerful model for studying how organisms balance competing behavioral drives and integrate signals involved in choice-like processes."
18477699,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,SmpB contributes to reading frame selection in the translation of transfer-messenger RNA.,"Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) acts first as a tRNA and then as an mRNA template to rescue stalled ribosomes in eubacteria. Together with its protein partner, SmpB (small protein B), tmRNA enters stalled ribosomes and transfers an Ala residue to the growing polypeptide chain. A remarkable step then occurs: the ribosome leaves the stalled mRNA and resumes translation using tmRNA as a template, adding a short peptide tag that destines the aborted protein for destruction. Exactly how the ribosome switches templates, resuming translation on tmRNA in the proper reading frame, remains unknown. Within the tmRNA sequence itself, five nucleotides (U85AGUC) immediately upstream of the first codon appear to direct frame selection. In particular, mutation of the conserved A86 results in severe loss of function both in vitro and in vivo. The A86C mutation causes translation to resume exclusively in the +1 frame. Several candidate binding partners for this upstream sequence have been identified in vitro. Using a genetic selection for tmRNA activity in Escherichia coli, we identified mutations in the SmpB protein that restore the function of A86C tmRNA in vivo. The SmpB mutants increase tagging in the normal reading frame and reduce tagging in the +1 frame. These results demonstrate that SmpB is functionally linked with the sequence upstream of the tmRNA template; both contribute to reading frame selection on tmRNA."
18479511,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Antigenic basis of diversity in the gammadelta T cell co-receptor WC1 family.,"WC1 co-receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins with 11 extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) domains. They are related to the CD163 family but are uniquely expressed by gammadelta T cells. We recently showed that at least 13 members comprise the WC1 gene family in cattle, a model animal species for studies of gammadelta T cell biology. Since WC1 co-receptors participate in directing functional responses by gammadelta T cells either through the ligands they bind or the signals they transduce, availability of reagents to identify the expression of individual WC1 molecules of this diverse family would be valuable in further elucidating mechanisms of gammadelta T cell responsiveness. Although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been widely used to identify WC1 co-receptors on gammadelta T cells, the locations of the antigenic epitopes recognized are unknown. Here, we mapped the epitopes to particular SRCR domains and evaluated their distribution among WC1 molecules. To do this, cDNA representing the extracellular domains of seven different WC1 genes was expressed in mammalian cells and analyzed for reactivity with anti-WC1 mAbs using ELISA and Western blotting. The study included mAbs that are broadly reactive with WC1(+) gammadelta T cells and those that divide WC1(+) gammadelta T cells into functionally distinct subpopulations. We found that mAb CC15 is a pan-reactive anti-WC1 mAb recognizing an epitope in the closely related SRCR domains 2 and 7 and that this epitope is present in at least domain 2 or 7 of all seven WC1 molecules evaluated here. Five other anti-WC1 mAbs, typified by mAb IL-A29, were found to be broadly reactive, recognizing epitopes in the related SRCR domains 4 and 9 but each having a unique pattern of reactivity with the seven WC1 molecules. Finally, the subpopulation-specific anti-WC1 mAbs, including those that recognize either the archetypal WC1.1 or WC1.2 molecule, were found to react with epitopes in the most variable WC1 domain, i.e. domain 1, of a restricted number of WC1 co-receptors."

18480253,1,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,The TGFBR1*6A allele is not associated with susceptibility to colorectal cancer in a Spanish population: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: TGF-beta receptor type I is a mediator of growth inhibitory signals. TGFBR1*6A (rs11466445) is a common polymorphic variant of the TGF-beta receptor I gene and has been associated with tumour susceptibility. Nevertheless, the role of this polymorphism as a risk factor for colorectal cancer is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the association between TGFBR1*6A and colorectal cancer, age, sex, tumour location and tumour stage in a Spanish population. METHODS: The case-control study involved 800 Spanish subjects: 400 sporadic colorectal cancer patients and 400 age-, sex-, and ethnic-matched controls. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the TGFBR1*6A polymorphism were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. Analysis of somatic mutations at the GCG repeat of TGFBR1 exon 1 and germline allele-specific expression were also conducted to obtain further information on the contribution of the TGFBR1*6A allele to CRC susceptibility. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between the TGFBR1*6A allele and CRC (p &gt; 0.05). The OR was 1.147 (95% CI: 0.799-1.647) for carriers of the TGFBR1*6A allele and 0.878 (95% CI: 0.306-2.520) for homozygous TGFBR1*6A individuals compared with the reference. The frequency of the polymorphism was not affected by age, sex or tumour stage. The TGFBR1*6A allele was more prevalent among colon tumour patients than among rectal tumour patients. Tumour somatic mutations were found in only two of 69 cases (2.9%). Both cases involved a GCG deletion that changed genotype 9A/9A in normal DNA to genotype 9A/8A. Interestingly, these two tumours were positive for microsatellite instability, suggesting that these mutations originated because of a deficient DNA mismatch repair system.Allele-specific expression of the 9A allele was detected in seven of the 14 heterozygous 9A/6A tumour cases. This could have been caused by linkage disequilibrium of the TGFBR1*6A allele with mutations that cause allele-specific expression, as was recently suggested. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the TGFBR1*6A allele does not confer an increased risk of colorectal cancer in the Spanish population."
18480843,1,J. Med. Chem.,9716531,2009,Potential neuroprotective drugs in cerebral ischemia: new saturated and polyunsaturated lipids coupled to hydrophilic moieties: synthesis and biological activity.,"The ganglioside GM1 has neuroprotective effects but is not of therapeutic value because of its lack of bioavailability. Thus, molecules that mimic GM1 represent a novel approach to neuroprotection. We have synthesized 19 small GM1-like analogues whose simplified structure includes a hydrophobic saturated or unsaturated moiety linked to a hydrophilic moiety. We report their neuroprotective effects in two distinct models of nerve cell death using hippocampus-derived HT22 cells. We found that several analogues protected the HT22 cells from death at concentrations ranging from 2 to 5 microM. Additional neuroprotective assays using cortical slices injured by glutamate confirmed these results. Since members of the MAP kinase family are known to be key players in nerve cell survival and death, we characterized the role of these kinases in the neuroprotective mechanisms of the GM1-like analogues. Interestingly, the results indicate that the compounds provide neuroprotection through distinct mechanisms of action."
18483193,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Probing the dynamics of the P1 helix within the Tetrahymena group I intron.,"RNA conformational transformations are integral to RNA's biological functions. Further, structured RNA molecules exist as a series of dynamic intermediates in the course of folding or complexation with proteins. Thus, an understanding of RNA folding and function will require deep and incisive understanding of its dynamic behavior. However, existing tools to investigate RNA dynamics are limited. Here, we introduce a powerful fluorescence polarization anisotropy approach that utilizes a rare base analogue that retains substantial fluorescence when incorporated into helices. We show that 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6-MI) can be used to follow the nanosecond dynamics of individual helices. We then use 6-MI to probe the dynamics of an individual helix, referred to as P1, within the 400nt Tetrahymena group I ribozyme. Comparisons of the dynamics of the P1 helix in wild type and mutant ribozymes and in model constructs reveal a highly immobilized docked state of the P1 helix, as expected, and a relatively mobile &quot;open complex&quot; or undocked state. This latter result rules out a model in which slow docking of the P1 helix into its cognate tertiary interactions arises from a stable alternatively docked conformer. The results are consistent with a model in which stacking and tertiary interactions of the A(3) tether connecting the P1 helix to the body of the ribozyme limit P1 mobility and slow its docking, and this model is supported by cross-linking results. The ability to isolate the nanosecond motions of individual helices within complex RNAs and RNA/protein complexes will be valuable in distinguishing between functional models and in discerning the fundamental behavior of important biological species."
18483195,1,Yeast,8607637,2009,Identification of proteins associated with the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase by tandem affinity purification.,"The abundance of mitochondrial (mt) transcripts varies under different conditions, and is thought to depend upon rates of transcription initiation, transcription termination/attenuation and RNA processing/degradation. The requirement to maintain the balance between RNA synthesis and processing may involve coordination between these processes; however, little is known about factors that regulate the activity of mtRNA polymerase (mtRNAP). Recent attempts to identify mtRNAP-protein interactions in yeast by means of a generalized tandem affinity purification (TAP) protocol were not successful, most likely because they involved a C-terminal mtRNAP-TAP fusion (which is incompatible with mtRNAP function) and because of the use of whole-cell solubilization protocols that did not preserve the integrity of mt protein complexes. Based upon the structure of T7 RNAP (to which mtRNAPs show high sequence similarity), we identified positions in yeast mtRNAP that allow insertion of a small affinity tag, confirmed the mature N-terminus, constructed a functional N-terminal TAP-mtRNAP fusion, pulled down associated proteins, and identified them by LC-MS-MS. Among the proteins found in the pull-down were a DEAD-box protein (Mss116p) and an RNA-binding protein (Pet127p). Previous genetic experiments suggested a role for these proteins in linking transcription and RNA degradation, in that a defect in the mt degradadosome could be suppressed by overexpression of either of these proteins or, independently, by mutations in either mtRNAP or its initiation factor Mtf1p. Further, we found that Mss116p inhibits transcription by mtRNAP in vitro in a steady-state reaction. Our results support the hypothesis that Mss116p and Pet127p are involved in modulation of mtRNAP activity."
18483487,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Antimicrobial resistance among isolates causing invasive pneumococcal disease before and after licensure of heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) on antibiotic resistance among pneumococcal strains causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has varied in different locales in the United States. We assessed trends in IPD including trends for IPD caused by penicillin non-susceptible strains before and after licensure of PCV-7 and the impact of the 2008 susceptibility breakpoints for penicillin on the epidemiology of resistance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective review of IPD cases at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center. Subjects were &lt; or = 18 years of age with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sterile body sites from January 1995-December 2006. The rate of IPD from 1995-1999 versus 2002-2006 significantly decreased from 4.1 (CI(95) 3.4, 4.8) to 1.7 (CI(95) 1.3, 2.2) per 1,000 admissions. Using the breakpoints in place during the study period, the proportion of penicillin non-susceptible strains increased from 27% to 49% in the pre- vs. post-PCV-7 era, respectively (p = 0.001), although the rate of IPD caused by non-susceptible strains did not change from 1995-1999 (1.1 per 1,000 admissions, CI(95) 0.8, 1.5) when compared with 2002-2006 (0.8 per 1,000 admissions, CI(95) 0.6, 1.2). In the multivariate logistic regression model controlling for the effects of age, strains causing IPD in the post-PCV-7 era were significantly more likely to be penicillin non-susceptible compared with strains in the pre-PCV-7 era (OR 2.46, CI(95) 1.37, 4.40). However, using the 2008 breakpoints for penicillin, only 8% of strains were non-susceptible in the post-PCV-7 era. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To date, there are few reports that document an increase in the relative proportion of penicillin non-susceptible strains of pneumococci causing IPD following the introduction of PCV-7. Active surveillance of pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic resistance using the new penicillin breakpoints is imperative to assess potential changes in the epidemiology of IPD."
18485875,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,The CD8 and CD4 T-cell response against Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is skewed towards early and late lytic antigens.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally related to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common malignancy in untreated individuals with HIV/AIDS. The adaptive T-cell immune response against KSHV has not been fully characterized. To achieve a better understanding of the antigenic repertoire of the CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses against KSHV, we constructed a library of lentiviral expression vectors each coding for one of 31 individual KSHV open reading frames (ORFs). We used these to transduce monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) isolated from 14 KSHV-seropositive (12 HIV-positive) and 7 KSHV-seronegative (4 HIV-positive) individuals. moDCs were transduced with up to 3 KSHV ORFs simultaneously (ORFs grouped according to their expression during the viral life cycle). Transduced moDCs naturally process the KSHV genes and present the resulting antigens in the context of MHC class I and II. Transduced moDCs were cultured with purified autologous T cells and the CD8 and CD4 T-cell proliferative responses to each KSHV ORF (or group) was assessed using a CFSE dye-based assay. Two pools of early lytic KSHV genes ([ORF8/ORF49/ORF61] and [ORF59/ORF65/K4.1]) were frequently-recognized targets of both CD8 and CD4 T cells from KSHV seropositive individuals. One pool of late lytic KSHV genes ([ORF28/ORF36/ORF37]) was a frequently-recognized CD8 target and another pool of late genes ([ORF33/K1/K8.1]) was a frequently-recognized CD4 target. We report that both the CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses against KSHV are skewed towards genes expressed in the early and late phases of the viral lytic cycle, and identify some previously unknown targets of these responses. This knowledge will be important to future immunological investigations into KSHV and may eventually lead to the development of better immunotherapies for KSHV-related diseases."
18486613,1,Nature,410462,2009,Copy number variation at 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma.,"Common copy number variations (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic diversity, yet their influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. To address this problem in human cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study of CNVs in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, a disease in which single nucleotide polymorphism variations are known to influence susceptibility. We first genotyped 846 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 healthy Caucasian controls at approximately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed a CNV-based test for association. We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. Here we describe the identification of a common CNV at chromosome 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets. This CNV was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization and analysis of matched tumour specimens, and was shown to be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free parent-offspring trios. We identified a previously unknown transcript within the CNV that showed high sequence similarity to several neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPF23). This transcript was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and the expression level was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a previously unknown neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer."
18490658,1,Mol. Syst. Biol.,101235389,2009,Genome-wide allele- and strand-specific expression profiling.,"Recent reports have shown that most of the genome is transcribed and that transcription frequently occurs concurrently on both DNA strands. In diploid genomes, the expression level of each allele conditions the degree to which sequence polymorphisms affect the phenotype. It is thus essential to quantify expression in an allele- and strand-specific manner. Using a custom-designed tiling array and a new computational approach, we piloted measuring allele- and strand-specific expression in yeast. Confident quantitative estimates of allele-specific expression were obtained for about half of the coding and non-coding transcripts of a heterozygous yeast strain, of which 371 transcripts (13%) showed significant allelic differential expression greater than 1.5-fold. The data revealed complex allelic differential expression on opposite strands. Furthermore, combining allele-specific expression with linkage mapping enabled identifying allelic variants that act in cis and in trans to regulate allelic expression in the heterozygous strain. Our results provide the first high-resolution analysis of differential expression on all four strands of an eukaryotic genome."
18490661,1,Nature,410462,2009,Adaptive prediction of environmental changes by microorganisms.,"Natural habitats of some microorganisms may fluctuate erratically, whereas others, which are more predictable, offer the opportunity to prepare in advance for the next environmental change. In analogy to classical Pavlovian conditioning, microorganisms may have evolved to anticipate environmental stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance. Here we present evidence for environmental change anticipation in two model microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that anticipation is an adaptive trait, because pre-exposure to the stimulus that typically appears early in the ecology improves the organism's fitness when encountered with a second stimulus. Additionally, we observe loss of the conditioned response in E. coli strains that were repeatedly exposed in a laboratory evolution experiment only to the first stimulus. Focusing on the molecular level reveals that the natural temporal order of stimuli is embedded in the wiring of the regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes that would be needed for later ones, yet later stimuli only induce genes needed to cope with them. Our work indicates that environmental anticipation is an adaptive trait that was repeatedly selected for during evolution and thus may be ubiquitous in biology."

Moreover, the direction of flow within lymphatic networks is often unpredictable especially in areas with well-developed &quot;watershed&quot; or overlapping lymphatics. Herein, we report a method of in vivo real-time multicolor lymphatic imaging using cadmium-selenium quantum dots (Qdots) with a fluorescence imaging system that enables the simultaneous visualization of up to five distinct lymphatic basins in real-time. Five visually well-distinguishable carboxyl-Qdots (Qdot 545, 565, 585, 605, and 655) were selected and injected subdermally into mice at five different sites, and serially imaged in vivo or in situ under surgery with real-time multicolor lymphatic imaging. In all seven mice, in vivo lymphatic images successfully distinguished all five lymphatic basins with different colors in real-time. These visualizations of lymph node lasted up to at least 7 days. This method could have a considerable potential in lymphatic research for studying the anatomy and flow within the lymphatic system as well as in some limited clinical settings where real-time visible fluorescence could facilitate procedures under surgery or endoscopy."
18492870,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Cancer incidence in British vegetarians.,"BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have examined cancer incidence among vegetarians. METHODS: We studied 61,566 British men and women, comprising 32,403 meat eaters, 8562 non-meat eaters who did eat fish ('fish eaters') and 20,601 vegetarians. After an average follow-up of 12.2 years, there were 3350 incident cancers of which 2204 were among meat eaters, 317 among fish eaters and 829 among vegetarians. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated by Cox regression, stratified by sex and recruitment protocol and adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, physical activity level and, for women only, parity and oral contraceptive use. RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity in cancer risk between groups for the following four cancer sites: stomach cancer, RRs (compared with meat eaters) of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.07-1.20) in fish eaters and 0.36 (0.16-0.78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.007; ovarian cancer, RRs of 0.37 (0.18-0.77) in fish eaters and 0.69 (0.45-1.07) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.007; bladder cancer, RRs of 0.81 (0.36-1.81) in fish eaters and 0.47 (0.25-0.89) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.05; and cancers of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues, RRs of 0.85 (0.56-1.29) in fish eaters and 0.55 (0.39-0.78) in vegetarians, P for heterogeneity=0.002. The RRs for all malignant neoplasms were 0.82 (0.73-0.93) in fish eaters and 0.88 (0.81-0.96) in vegetarians (P for heterogeneity=0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of some cancers may be lower in fish eaters and vegetarians than in meat eaters."
18494562,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,"HPV infection in women with and without cervical cancer in Conakry, Guinea.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence in western Africa is among the highest in the world. METHODS: To investigate human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Guinea, we obtained cervical specimens from 831 women aged 18-64 years from the general population of the capital Conakry and from 77 locally diagnosed invasive cervical cancers (ICC). Human papillomavirus was detected using a GP5+/6+ PCR-based assay. RESULTS: Among the general population, the prevalence of cervical abnormalities was 2.6% by visual inspection and 9.5% by liquid-based cytology. Fourteen of 15 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were visual inspection-negative. Human papillomavirus prevalence was 50.8% (32.1% for high-risk types) and relatively constant across all age groups. Being single or reporting &gt; or =3 sexual partners was significantly associated with HPV positivity. HPV16 was the most common type, both among the general population (7.3%) and, notably in ICC (48.6%). HPV45 (18.6%) and HPV18 (14.3%), the next most common types in ICC, were also more common in ICC than in HPV-positive women with normal cytology from the general population. CONCLUSION: The heavy burden of HPV infection and severe cervical lesions in Guinean women calls for new effective interventions. Sixty-three per cent of cervical cancers are theoretically preventable by HPV16/18 vaccines in Guinea; perhaps more if some cross-protection exists with HPV45."
18495927,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Lack of MyD88 protects the immunodeficient host against fatal lung inflammation triggered by the opportunistic bacteria Burkholderia cenocepacia.,"Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen of major concern for cystic fibrosis patients as well as immunocompromised cancer patients and transplant recipients. The mechanisms by which B. cenocepacia triggers a rapid health deterioration of the susceptible host have yet to be characterized. TLR and their key signaling intermediate MyD88 play a central role in the detection of microbial molecular patterns and in the initiation of an effective immune response. We performed a study to better understand the role of TLR-MyD88 signaling in B. cenocepacia-induced pathogenesis in the immunocompromised host, using an experimental murine model. The time-course of several dynamic parameters, including animal survival, bacterial load, and secretion of critical inflammatory mediators, was compared in infected and immunosuppressed wild-type and MyD88(-/-) mice. Notably, when compared with wild-type mice, infected MyD88(-/-) animals displayed significantly reduced levels of inflammatory mediators (including KC, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MIP-2, and G-CSF) in blood and lung airspaces. Moreover, despite a higher transient bacterial load in the lungs, immunosuppressed mice deficient in MyD88 had an unexpected survival advantage. Finally, we showed that this B. cenocepacia-induced life-threatening infection of wild-type mice involved the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and could be prevented by corticosteroids. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that a MyD88-dependent pathway can critically contribute to a detrimental host inflammatory response that leads to fatal pneumonia."
18495928,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Regulation of synaptic structure by ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1.,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is selectively and abundantly expressed in the brain, and its activity is required for normal synaptic function. Here, we show that UCH-L1 functions in maintaining normal synaptic structure in hippocampal neurons. We found that UCH-L1 activity is rapidly upregulated by NMDA receptor activation, which leads to an increase in the levels of free monomeric ubiquitin. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of UCH-L1 significantly reduces monomeric ubiquitin levels and causes dramatic alterations in synaptic protein distribution and spine morphology. Inhibition of UCH-L1 activity increases spine size while decreasing spine density. Furthermore, there is a concomitant increase in the size of presynaptic and postsynaptic protein clusters. Interestingly, however, ectopic expression of ubiquitin restores normal synaptic structure in UCH-L1-inhibited neurons. These findings point to a significant role of UCH-L1 in synaptic remodeling, most likely by modulating free monomeric ubiquitin levels in an activity-dependent manner."
18497745,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Oligonucleotide-mediated survival of motor neuron protein expression in CNS improves phenotype in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutation or deletion of the SMN1 gene encoding survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, resulting in the selective loss of alpha-motor neurons. Humans typically have one or more copies of the SMN2 gene, the coding region of which is nearly identical to SMN1, except that a point mutation causes splicing out of exon 7 and production of a largely nonfunctional SMNDelta7 protein. The development of drugs that mitigate aberrant SMN2 splicing is an attractive therapeutic approach for SMA. A steric block antisense oligonucleotide (AO) has recently been developed that blocked an intronic splice suppressor element, and enhanced SMN2 exon 7 inclusion in SMA patient fibroblasts. Here, we show that periodic intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of this AO resulted in increased SMN expression in brain and spinal cord to as much as 50% of the level of healthy littermates. Real-time PCR of SMN2 transcripts confirmed the AO-mediated increase in full-length SMN. The AO-derived increase in SMN expression led to a concomitant improvement in bodyweight throughout the lifespan of the SMA animals. Treatment of SMA mice with AO also provided partial correction of motor deficits, manifest as improved righting response. Injections of a scrambled oligonucleotide had no effect on SMN expression or phenotype in the SMA mice. Our results validate that AOs that abrogate aberrant splicing of SMN2 are promising compounds for treating SMA."

Immunol.,7905289,2009,"Molecular cloning and analysis of SSc5D, a new member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily.","Glycoproteins of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily contain one or more protein modules homologous to the membrane-distal domain of macrophage scavenger receptor I. These domains can be found in the extracellular regions of membrane proteins and in secreted glycoproteins, from the most primitive species to vertebrates. A systematic, bioinformatics-based search for putative human proteins related to the forty-seven known human group B SRCR domains identified a new family member that we have called Soluble Scavenger with 5 Domains (SSc5D). SSc5D is a new soluble protein whose expression is restricted to monocytes/macrophages and T-lymphocytes, and is particularly enriched in the placenta. The gene encoding SSc5D spans 30kb of genomic DNA, and contains fourteen exons producing a 4.8kb-long mRNA. The mature polypeptide is predicted to consist of 1573 amino acids comprising, towards the N-terminus, five very similar SRCR domains that are highly conserved among non-marsupial mammals, and a large (&gt;250nm), very heavily glycosylated, mucin-like sequence towards the C-terminus. Each of the SRCR domains is encoded by a single exon, and contains eight cysteine residues, as observed for all other group B SRCR domains. A shorter isoform encoded by a weakly expressed, alternatively spliced transcript, which lacks the mucin-like C-terminal region, was also identified. It seems likely that SSc5D has a role at the interface between adaptive and innate immunity, or in placental function."

This procedure (for IgG(DNP)) has three steps: (i) precipitation of proteins heavier than immunoglobulins with ammonium sulfate; (ii) formation of cyclic complexes of IgG(DNP) by causing it to bind to synthetic multivalent haptens containing multiple DNP groups; (iii) selective precipitation of these dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers of the target antibody, followed by regeneration of the free antibody. This procedure separates the targeted antibody from a mixture of antibodies, as well as from other proteins and globulins in a biological fluid. This method is applicable to antibodies with a wide range of monovalent binding constants (0.1 microM to 0.1 nM). The multivalent ligands we used (derivatives of DNP and digoxin) isolated IgG(DNP) and IgG(Dgn) from ascites fluid in yields of &gt;80% and with &gt;95% purity. This technique has two advantages over conventional chromatographic methods for purifying antibodies: (i) it is selective for antibodies with two active Fab binding sites (both sites are required to form the cyclic complexes) over antibodies with one or zero active Fab binding sites; (ii) it does not require chromatographic separation. It has the disadvantage that the structure of the hapten must be compatible with the synthesis of bi- and/or trivalent analogues."

Gastrointestinal manifestations of dysthyroidism are numerous and involve all portions of the tract. Thyroid hormone action on motility has been widely studied, but more complex pathophysiologic mechanisms have been indicated by some studies although these are not fully understood. Both thyroid hormone excess and deficiency can have similar digestive manifestations, such as diarrhea, although the mechanism is different in each situation. The liver is the most affected organ in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Specific digestive diseases may be associated with autoimmune thyroid processes, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Grave's disease. Among them, celiac sprue and primary biliary cirrhosis are the most frequent although a clear common mechanism has never been proven. Overall, thyroid-related digestive manifestations were described decades ago but studies are still needed in order to confirm old concepts or elucidate undiscovered mechanisms. All practitioners must be aware of digestive symptoms due to dysthyroidism in order to avoid misdiagnosis of rare but potentially lethal situations."

However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences."

Previously, infection of IFNgamma-unresponsive mice with gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) showed that IFNgamma controlled chronic infection, limiting chronic diseases including arteritis and pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we show that gammaHV68-infected IFNgamma receptor-deficient (IFNgammaR(-/-)) mice uniformly develop angiocentric inflammatory lesions in the lung. Prolonged infection revealed a range of outcomes, from spontaneous regression to pulmonary lymphoma. By 12 months of infection, 80% of mice had lymphoid hyperplasia or pulmonary lymphoma; 45% of infected mice developed frank tumors between 5 and 12 months postinfection, with some mice showing systemic involvement. Lymphomas were composed of B lymphocytes and contained latently infected cells. Although IFNgammaR(-/-) mice control chronic gammaHV68 infection poorly, both early and late pathologies were indistinguishable between wild-type and reactivation-defective virus infection, indicating that, in contrast with other previously described gammaHV68-associated pathologies, these chronic diseases were not dependent on the reactivation of latent infection. This distinct combination of latent infection and defined host defect led to a specific and consistent lymphoproliferative disease. Significantly, this mouse model of virus-associated pulmonary B-cell lymphoma closely mimics the full spectrum of human lymphomatoid granulomatosis, an EBV-associated malignancy with no effective treatment."
18509053,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Characterization of phospholipase C gamma enzymes with gain-of-function mutations.,"Phospholipase C gamma isozymes (PLC gamma 1 and PLC gamma 2) have a crucial role in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. Both enzymes have also been implicated in signaling events underlying aberrant cellular responses. Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, we have recently identified single point mutations in murine PLC gamma 2 that lead to spontaneous inflammation and autoimmunity. Here we describe further, mechanistic characterization of two gain-of-function mutations, D993G and Y495C, designated as ALI5 and ALI14. The residue Asp-993, mutated in ALI5, is a conserved residue in the catalytic domain of PLC enzymes. Analysis of PLC gamma 1 and PLC gamma 2 with point mutations of this residue showed that removal of the negative charge enhanced PLC activity in response to EGF stimulation or activation by Rac. Measurements of PLC activity in vitro and analysis of membrane binding have suggested that ALI5-type mutations facilitate membrane interactions without compromising substrate binding and hydrolysis. The residue mutated in ALI14 (Tyr-495) is within the spPH domain. Replacement of this residue had no effect on folding of the domain and enhanced Rac activation of PLC gamma 2 without increasing Rac binding. Importantly, the activation of the ALI14-PLC gamma 2 and corresponding PLC gamma 1 variants was enhanced in response to EGF stimulation and bypassed the requirement for phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues. ALI5- and ALI14-type mutations affected basal activity only slightly; however, their combination resulted in a constitutively active PLC. Based on these data, we suggest that each mutation could compromise auto-inhibition in the inactive PLC, facilitating the activation process; in addition, ALI5-type mutations could enhance membrane interaction in the activated state."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Evidence for an ionic intermediate in the transformation of fatty acid hydroperoxide by a catalase-related allene oxide synthase from the Cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina.,"Allene oxides are reactive epoxides biosynthesized from fatty acid hydroperoxides by specialized cytochrome P450s or by catalase-related hemoproteins. Here we cloned, expressed, and characterized a gene encoding a lipoxygenase-catalase/peroxidase fusion protein from Acaryochloris marina. We identified novel allene oxide synthase (AOS) activity and a by-product that provides evidence of the reaction mechanism. The fatty acids 18.4omega3 and 18.3omega3 are oxygenated to the 12R-hydroperoxide by the lipoxygenase domain and converted to the corresponding 12R,13-epoxy allene oxide by the catalase-related domain. Linoleic acid is oxygenated to its 9R-hydroperoxide and then, surprisingly, converted approximately 70% to an epoxyalcohol identified spectroscopically and by chemical synthesis as 9R,10S-epoxy-13S-hydroxyoctadeca-11E-enoic acid and only approximately 30% to the 9R,10-epoxy allene oxide. Experiments using oxygen-18-labeled 9R-hydroperoxide substrate and enzyme incubations conducted in H2(18)O indicated that approximately 72% of the oxygen in the epoxyalcohol 13S-hydroxyl arises from water, a finding that points to an ionic intermediate (epoxy allylic carbocation) during catalysis. AOS and epoxyalcohol synthase activities are mechanistically related, with a reacting intermediate undergoing a net hydrogen abstraction or hydroxylation, respectively. The existence of epoxy allylic carbocations in fatty acid transformations is widely implicated although for AOS reactions, without direct experimental support. Our findings place together in strong association the reactions of allene oxide synthesis and an ionic reaction intermediate in the AOS-catalyzed transformation."

Expression is believed to be transcriptionally regulated, and several cis-acting elements have been identified in the cathelicidin putative promoter. However, the trans-acting factors have not been clearly defined. We have recently reported that bacterial exotoxins suppress cathelicidin expression in sodium butyrate-differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (ECs), and this may be mediated through inducible cAMP early repressor. Here we have shown that cAMP-signaling pathways transcriptionally regulate cathelicidin expression in various ECs. cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and AP-1 (activator protein-1) bind to the cathelicidin putative promoter in vitro. Additionally, transcriptional complexes containing CREB, AP-1, and cathelicidin upstream regulatory sequences are formed within ECs. We have also shown that these complexes may activate cathelicidin promoter and are required for its inducible expression in ECs. This is underscored by the fact that silencing of CREB and AP-1 results in failure of ECs to up-regulate cathelicidin, and hepatitis B virus X protein may use CREB to induce cathelicidin. On the other hand, inducible cAMP early repressor competes with CREB and AP-1 for binding to the cathelicidin promoter and represses transcription, thus functioning as a counter-regulatory mechanism. Finally, both CREB and AP-1 were shown to play major roles in the regulation of cathelicidin in sodium butyrate-differentiated HT-29 cells. This is the first report of a detailed mechanistic study of inducible cathelicidin expression in the mucosal ECs. At the same time, it describes a novel immunomodulatory function of cAMP."
18509523,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Direct Bre1-Paf1 complex interactions and RING finger-independent Bre1-Rad6 interactions mediate histone H2B ubiquitylation in yeast.,"Recent yeast genetic studies have implicated the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin ligase functions of yRad6 and yBre1, respectively, in H2B ubiquitylation. However, there have been no corresponding biochemical analyses demonstrating intrinsic enzyme activities of yRad6 and yBre1 or related mechanistic details. Here, we describe a robust in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay that involves purified H2B ubiquitylation factors and natural nucleosomes. Our results indicate that yRad6 has an in vitro ability to nonspecifically ubiquitylate all core histones in the absence of an ubiquitin ligase but that yBre1 functions, through direct interactions with yRad6, to direct the ubiquitin conjugating activity of yRad6 toward the physiological H2B ubiquitylation site. Moreover, a yRad6 domain mapping analysis shows that an intact UBC domain is required for binding to yBre1, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail domain that is not required for a stable yBre1-yRad6 interaction is necessary for full enzyme activity of yRad6. We also find that, analogous to heteromeric complex formation by BRE1 paralogues in other organisms, yBre1 forms a homo-multimeric complex. Of special significance, our detailed biochemical analyses further show that the yBre1 RING finger domain is essential for H2B ubiquitylation but, surprisingly, dispensable for interaction of yBre1 with yRad6. In further support of the genetically identified requirement of the RNA polymerase II-associated yPaf1 complex for H2B ubiquitylation, protein interaction studies reveal that a purified yPaf1 complex directly and selectively interacts with yBre1 and thus serves to link the H2B ubiquitylation and general transcription machineries. These studies provide a more detailed mechanistic basis for H2B ubiquitylation in yeast."

They comprise three plasmalogen and one diacyl phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) (16:0p, 18:1p, 18:0p, and 18:0a at sn-1) and are absent in macrophages from 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-deficient mice. They are generated acutely in response to calcium mobilization, are primarily cell-associated, and are detected on the outside of the plasma membrane. Levels of 12-HETE-PEs in naïve lavage are in a similar range to those of free 12-HETE (5.5 +/- 0.2 ng or 18.5 +/- 1.03 ng/lavage for esterified versus free, respectively). In healthy mice, 12/15-LOX-derived 12-HETE-PEs are found in the peritoneal cavity, peritoneal membrane, lymph node, and intestine, with a similar distribution to 12/15-LOX-derived 12-HETE. In vivo generation of 12-HETE-PEs occurs in a Th2-dependent model of murine lung inflammation associated with interleukin-4/interleukin-13 expression. In contrast, in Toll receptor-dependent peritonitis mediated either by live bacteria or bacterial products, 12-HETE-PEs are rapidly cleared during the acute phase then reappear during resolution. The human homolog, 18:0a/15-HETE-PE inhibited human monocyte generation of cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide. In summary, a new family of lipid mediators generated by murine macrophages during Th2 inflammation are identified and structurally characterized. The studies suggest a new paradigm for lipids generated by 12/15-LOX in inflammation involving formation of esterified eicosanoids."

For each of these enzymes, the minor effects of changing viscosity indicate that k(cat)/K(m) is governed by the central chemical events in the enzyme-substrate complex rather than by enzyme-substrate encounter. Individual Arrhenius plots, obtained at intervals between pH 4.8 and 11.0, yielded Delta H(#) and T Delta S(#) for the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP(2-), ATP(3-), and ATP(4-) in the absence of Mg(2+). The addition of Mg(2+) led to partly compensating changes in Delta H(#) and T Delta S(#), accelerating the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 11-fold at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The rate enhancements produced by yeast hexokinase, homoserine kinase, and N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (obtained by comparison of their k(cat)/K(m) values in the presence of saturating phosphoryl acceptor with the second order rate constant for methanolysis of MgATP) ranged between 10(12)- and 10(14)-fold. Their nominal affinities for the altered substrates in the transition state were 2.1 x 10(-16) m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, 7.4 x 10(-17) m for homoserine kinase, and 6.4 x 10(-18) m for hexokinase. Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action."

Cell,101120028,2009,Distinct regulatory cascades govern extraocular and pharyngeal arch muscle progenitor cell fates.,"Genetic regulatory networks governing skeletal myogenesis in the body are well understood, yet their hierarchical relationships in the head remain unresolved. We show that either Myf5 or Mrf4 is necessary for initiating extraocular myogenesis. Whereas Mrf4 is dispensable for pharyngeal muscle progenitor fate, Tbx1 and Myf5 act synergistically for governing myogenesis in this location. As in the body, Myod acts epistatically to the initiating cascades in the head. Thus, complementary pathways, governed by Pax3 for body, and Tbx1 for pharyngeal muscles, but absent for extraocular muscles, activate the core myogenic network. These diverse muscle progenitors maintain their respective embryonic regulatory signatures in the adult. However, these signatures are not sufficient to ensure the specific muscle phenotypes, since the expected differentiated phenotype is not manifested when satellite cells are engrafted heterotopically. These findings identify novel genetic networks that may provide insights into myopathies which often affect only subsets of muscles."

18511904,1,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Identification of candidate structured RNAs in the marine organism 'Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique'.,"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic sequence data are proving to be a vast resource for the discovery of biological components. Yet analysis of this data to identify functional RNAs lags behind efforts to characterize protein diversity. The genome of 'Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique' HTCC 1062 is the closest match for approximately 20% of marine metagenomic sequence reads. It is also small, contains little non-coding DNA, and has strikingly low GC content. RESULTS: To aid the discovery of RNA motifs within the marine metagenome we exploited the genomic properties of 'Cand. P. ubique' by targeting our search to long intergenic regions (IGRs) with relatively high GC content. Analysis of known RNAs (rRNA, tRNA, riboswitches etc.) shows that structured RNAs are significantly enriched in such IGRs. To identify additional candidate structured RNAs, we examined other IGRs with similar characteristics from 'Cand. P. ubique' using comparative genomics approaches in conjunction with marine metagenomic data. Employing this strategy, we discovered four candidate structured RNAs including a new riboswitch class as well as three additional likely cis-regulatory elements that precede genes encoding ribosomal proteins S2 and S12, and the cytoplasmic protein component of the signal recognition particle. We also describe four additional potential RNA motifs with few or no examples occurring outside the metagenomic data. CONCLUSION: This work begins the process of identifying functional RNA motifs present in the metagenomic data and illustrates how existing completed genomes may be used to aid in this task."
18511905,1,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1: wider roles in cancer progression and prevention.,"CYP1A1 is one of the main cytochrome P450 enzymes, examined extensively for its capacity to activate compounds with carcinogenic properties. Continuous exposure to inhalation chemicals and environmental carcinogens is thought to increase the level of CYP1A1 expression in extrahepatic tissues, through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although the latter has long been recognized as a ligand-induced transcription factor, which is responsible for the xenobiotic activating pathway of several phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes, recent evidence suggests that the AhR is involved in various cell signaling pathways critical to cell cycle regulation and normal homeostasis. Disregulation of these pathways is implicated in tumor progression. In addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that CYP1A1 plays an important role in the detoxication of environmental carcinogens, as well as in the metabolic activation of dietary compounds with cancer preventative activity. Ultimately the contribution of CYP1A1 to cancer progression or prevention may depend on the balance of procarcinogen activation/detoxication and dietary natural product extrahepatic metabolism."
18511908,1,Genome Biol.,100960660,2009,A hidden reservoir of integrative elements is the major source of recently acquired foreign genes and ORFans in archaeal and bacterial genomes.,"BACKGROUND: Archaeal and bacterial genomes contain a number of genes of foreign origin that arose from recent horizontal gene transfer, but the role of integrative elements (IEs), such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements, in this process has not been extensively quantified. Moreover, it is not known whether IEs play an important role in the origin of ORFans (open reading frames without matches in current sequence databases), whose proportion remains stable despite the growing number of complete sequenced genomes. RESULTS: We have performed a large-scale survey of potential recently acquired IEs in 119 archaeal and bacterial genomes. We developed an accurate in silico Markov model-based strategy to identify clusters of genes that show atypical sequence composition (clusters of atypical genes or CAGs) and are thus likely to be recently integrated foreign elements, including IEs. Our method identified a high number of new CAGs. Probabilistic analysis of gene content indicates that 56% of these new CAGs are likely IEs, whereas only 7% likely originated via horizontal gene transfer from distant cellular sources. Thirty-four percent of CAGs remain unassigned, what may reflect a still poor sampling of IEs associated with bacterial and archaeal diversity. Moreover, our study contributes to the issue of the origin of ORFans, because 39% of these are found inside CAGs, many of which likely represent recently acquired IEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly indicate that archaeal and bacterial genomes contain an impressive proportion of recently acquired foreign genes (including ORFans) coming from a still largely unexplored reservoir of IEs."
18511940,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,FuGEFlow: data model and markup language for flow cytometry.,"BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry technology is widely used in both health care and research. The rapid expansion of flow cytometry applications has outpaced the development of data storage and analysis tools. Collaborative efforts being taken to eliminate this gap include building common vocabularies and ontologies, designing generic data models, and defining data exchange formats. The Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment (MIFlowCyt) standard was recently adopted by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. This standard guides researchers on the information that should be included in peer reviewed publications, but it is insufficient for data exchange and integration between computational systems. The Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) formalizes common aspects of comprehensive and high throughput experiments across different biological technologies. We have extended FuGE object model to accommodate flow cytometry data and metadata. METHODS: We used the MagicDraw modelling tool to design a UML model (Flow-OM) according to the FuGE extension guidelines and the AndroMDA toolkit to transform the model to a markup language (Flow-ML). We mapped each MIFlowCyt term to either an existing FuGE class or to a new FuGEFlow class. The development environment was validated by comparing the official FuGE XSD to the schema we generated from the FuGE object model using our configuration. After the Flow-OM model was completed, the final version of the Flow-ML was generated and validated against an example MIFlowCyt compliant experiment description. RESULTS: The extension of FuGE for flow cytometry has resulted in a generic FuGE-compliant data model (FuGEFlow), which accommodates and links together all information required by MIFlowCyt. The FuGEFlow model can be used to build software and databases using FuGE software toolkits to facilitate automated exchange and manipulation of potentially large flow cytometry experimental data sets. Additional project documentation, including reusable design patterns and a guide for setting up a development environment, was contributed back to the FuGE project. CONCLUSION: We have shown that an extension of FuGE can be used to transform minimum information requirements in natural language to markup language in XML. Extending FuGE required significant effort, but in our experiences the benefits outweighed the costs. The FuGEFlow is expected to play a central role in describing flow cytometry experiments and ultimately facilitating data exchange including public flow cytometry repositories currently under development."

During monsoon outbreak of chikungunya fever, we carried out the genetic predisposition to chikungunya in disease affected 100 families by doing blood group (ABO) tests by focusing on individuals who were likely to have a risk of chikungunya and identified the blood group involved in susceptibility/resistance to chikungunya. In the present study, based on blood group antigens, the individuals were kept in four groups - A (108), B (98), AB (20) and O (243). The result obtained was showed all Rh positive blood group individuals are susceptible to chikungunya fever. Among ABO group, the blood group O +ve individuals are more susceptible to chikungunya than other blood groups. No blood group with Rh negative was affected with chikungunya, it indicates Rh -ve more resistance to chikungunya."

The substrate scope of these reactions, however, is limited by the difficulties of preparing the starting alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. We now report that alpha'-hydroxyenones, which can be prepared in a single convenient step from aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes, can serve as efficient surrogates for enals in the annulation reactions. This protocol allows the facile preparation and use of substrates bearing nitrogen heterocycles. These reagents have also allowed us to demonstrate that, in contrast to other classes of aldehydes, the formation of the Breslow intermediate from enals and N-heterocyclic carbenes is irreversible under the reaction conditions."

The surface region, which extends to photoelectron kinetic energies of 400-500 eV, is partially depleted in anions relative to the bulk 3 M concentration. The nitrate and nitrite solutions exhibit similar depth-dependent anion profiles. The results presented here are compared with recent molecular dynamics simulations of a NaNO(3) solution and are found to agree at high photoelectron kinetic energies. At shallower probe depths, the experiment measured a surface anion concentration less than that predicted by theory. Possible origins of the discrepancy are discussed in terms of the confined size of the simulation box and uncertainties that remain in regard to the inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons in aqueous media. The importance of our findings is discussed in relation to the observed increase in photochemical activity of nitrate-containing aerosols in the atmosphere."

Unexpected diastereoselectivities are observed, suggesting that the condensation may proceed through a five- or six-membered cyclic iminium ion intermediate."
18528439,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Proton bridging in the interactions of thrombin with small inhibitors.,"Thrombin is the pivotal serine protease enzyme in the blood cascade system. Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK), phosphate, and phosphonate ester inhibitors form a covalent bond with the active-site Ser of thrombin. PPACK, a mechanism-based inhibitor, and the phosphate/phosphonate esters form adducts that mimic intermediates formed in reactions catalyzed by thrombin. Therefore, the dependence of the inhibition of human alpha-thrombin on the concentration of these inhibitors, pH, and temperature was investigated. The second-order rate constant (ki/Ki) and the inhibition constant (Ki) for inhibition of human alpha-thrombin by PPACK are (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) and (2.4 +/- 1.3) x 10(-8) M, respectively, at pH 7.00 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.15 M NaCl at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C, in good agreement with previous reports. The activation parameters at pH 7.00 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 0.15 M NaCl are as follows: DeltaH = 10.6 +/- 0.7 kcal/mol, and DeltaS = 9 +/- 2 cal mol(-1) degrees C(-1). The pH dependence of the second-order rate constants of inhibition is bell-shaped. Values of pKa1 and pKa2 are 7.3 +/- 0.2 and 8.8 +/- 0.3, respectively, at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. A phosphate and a phosphonate ester inhibitor gave higher values, 7.8 and 8.0 for pKa1 and 9.3 and 8.6 for pKa2, respectively. They inhibit thrombin more than 6 orders of magnitude less efficiently than PPACK does. The deuterium solvent isotope effect for the second-order rate constant at pH 7.0 and 8.3 at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C is unity within experimental error in all three cases, indicating the absence of proton transfer in the rate-determining step for the association of thrombin with the inhibitors, but in a 600 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the inhibition adduct at pH 6.7 and 30 degrees C, a peak at 18.10 ppm with respect to TSP appears with PPACK, which is absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution of the enzyme between pH 5.3 and 8.5. The peak at low field is an indication of the presence of a short-strong hydrogen bond (SSHB) at the active site in the adduct. The deuterium isotope effect on this hydrogen bridge is 2.2 +/- 0.2 (phi = 0.45). The presence of an SSHB is also established with a signal at 17.34 ppm for a dealkylated phosphate adduct of thrombin."
18532877,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Site-directed mutagenesis as a probe of the acid-base catalytic mechanism of homoisocitrate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HIcDH) catalyzes the Mg2+- and K+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of homoisocitrate to alpha-ketoadipate using NAD as the oxidant. A recent consideration of the structures of enzymes in the same family as HIcDH, including isopropylmalate and isocitrate dehydrogenases, suggests all of the family members utilize a Lys-Tyr pair to catalyze the acid-base chemistry of the reaction [Aktas, D. F., and Cook, P. F. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 3565-3577]. Multiple-sequence alignment indicates the active site Lys-Tyr pair consists of lysine 206 and tyrosine 150. Therefore, the K206M and Y150F mutants of HIcDH were prepared and characterized to test the potential roles of these residues as acid-base catalysts. The V/Et values of the K206M and Y150F mutant enzymes at pH 7.5 are decreased by approximately 2400- and approximately 680-fold, respectively, compared to that of wild-type HIcDH; the K(m) for HIc does not change significantly. V/Et and V/K(MgHIc)Et for the K206M mutant enzyme are pH-independent below pH 6 and decrease to a constant value above pH 7, while V/K(NAD)Et is independent over the pH range from 6.2 to 9.5. In the case of the Y150F mutant enzyme, V/Et and V/K(NAD)Et are pH-independent above pH 9.5 and decrease to a constant value below pH 8. This behavior can be compared to that of the wild-type enzyme, where V/Et decreases at high and low pH, giving pKa values of approximately 6.5 and approximately 9.5, respectively. Data were interpreted in terms of a group with a pKa of 6.5 that acts as a general base in the hydride transfer step and a group with a pKa of 9.5 that acts as a general acid to protonate C3 in the tautomerization reaction [Lin, Y., Volkman, J., Nicholas, K. M., Yamamoto, T., Eguchi, T., Nimmo, S. L., West, A. H., and Cook, P. F. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 4169-4180]. Solvent deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K(MgHIc) were near unity for the K206M mutant enzyme but approximately 2.2 for the Y150F mutant enzyme. The dramatic decreases in activity, the measured solvent deuterium isotope effects, and changes in the pH dependence of kinetic parameters compared to that of the wild type are consistent with K206 acting as a general base in the hydride transfer step of the wild-type enzyme but as a general acid in the Y150F mutant enzyme, replacing Y150 in the tautomerization reaction. In addition, Y150 acts as a general acid in the tautomerization reaction of the wild-type enzyme and replaces K206 as the general base in the hydride transfer step of the K206M mutant enzyme."

Current SAR studies along with those of many existing rimonabant-mimicking molecules imply that around the pyrazole C3-position, a rigid and deep binding pocket should exist for CB1 receptor. In addition, relative to the conventional carboxamide carbonyl, serving as a key hydrogen-bond acceptor during ligand-CB1 receptor interaction, the corresponding polarizable thione carbonyl might play a more critical role in stabilizing the Asp366-Lys192 salt bridge in the proposed CB1-receptor homology model and inducing significant selectivity for CB1R over CB2R."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Tracking footprints of maize domestication and evidence for a massive selective sweep on chromosome 10.,"Maize domestication is one of the greatest feats of artificial selection and evolution, wherein a weedy plant in Central Mexico was converted through human-mediated selection into the most productive crop in the world. In fact, the changes were so astounding that it took much of the last century to identify modern maize's true ancestor. Through modern genetic studies, the molecular basis of this evolution is being unraveled. Maize's new morphology and adaptation to diverse environments required selection at thousands of loci, and we are beginning to understand the magnitude and rates of these genetic changes. Most of the known major genes have experienced strong selection, but only small regions surrounding the selected genes exhibit substantially reduced genetic diversity. Here, we report the discovery of a large region on chromosome 10 involved in adaptation or domestication that has been the target of strong selection during maize domestication. Unlike previously described regions in the maize genome, 1.1 Mb and &gt;15 genes lost genetic diversity during selection at this region. Finally, the prospects of a detailed understanding of maize evolution are discussed with consideration of both top-down and bottom-up approaches."

To clarify the functional mechanisms linking the OPRM1 A118G SNP to addiction and analgesia phenotypes, we derived a mouse model possessing the equivalent nucleotide/amino acid substitution in the Oprm1 gene. Mice harboring this SNP (A112G) demonstrated several phenotypic similarities to humans carrying the A118G SNP, including reduced mRNA expression and morphine-mediated antinociception. We found additional phenotypes associated with this SNP including significant reductions of receptor protein levels, morphine-mediated hyperactivity, and the development of locomotor sensitization in mice harboring the G112 allele. In addition, we found sex-specific reductions in the rewarding properties of morphine and the aversive components of naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Further cross-species analysis will allow us to investigate mechanisms and adaptations present in humans carrying this SNP."
18541915,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Sexual selection and mating systems.,"Sexual selection is among the most powerful of all evolutionary forces. It occurs when individuals within one sex secure mates and produce offspring at the expense of other individuals within the same sex. Darwin was first to recognize the power of sexual selection to change male and female phenotypes, and, in noting that sexual selection is nonubiquitous, Darwin was also first to recognize the importance of mating system--the &quot;special circumstances&quot; in which reproduction occurs within species. Analyses of mating systems since Darwin have emphasized either the genetic relationships between male and female mating elements, usually among plants, or the numbers of mates males and females may obtain, usually among animals. Combining these schemes yields a quantitative methodology that emphasizes measurement of the sex difference in the variance in relative fitness, as well as phenotypic and genetic correlations underlying reproductive traits that may arise among breeding pairs. Such information predicts the degree and direction of sexual dimorphism within species, it allows the classification of mating systems using existing genetic and life history data, and with information on the spatial and temporal distributions of fertilizations, it may also predict floral morphology in plants. Because this empirical framework identifies selective forces and genetic architectures responsible for observed male-female differences, it compliments discoveries of nucleotide sequence variation and the expression of quantitative traits. Moreover, because this methodology emphasizes the process of evolutionary change, it is easier to test and interpret than frameworks emphasizing parental investment in offspring and its presumed evolutionary outcomes."

Progress is hampered by lack of appropriate experimental models in which to study resistance to transplantation tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that T helper 1-associated T box 21 transcription factor (Tbet) KO recipients exhibit allograft tolerance resistance specifically mediated by IL-17-producing CD8 T (T17) cells. Neutralization of IL-17 facilitates long-term cardiac allograft survival with combined T cell co-stimulation (CD28-CD80/86 and CD154-CD40) blockade in Tbet KO recipients. We have used this T17-biased Tbet KO model of allograft tolerance resistance to study the impact of targeting a T cell-co-stimulatory pathway, and demonstrate that targeting T cell Ig and mucin domain-1 (Tim-1) with anti-Tim-1 overcomes this resistance by specifically inhibiting the pathogenic IL-17-producing CD8 T17 cells. These data indicate that in the absence of Th1 immunity, CD8 T17 alloreactivity constitutes a barrier to transplantation tolerance. Targeting TIM-1 provides an approach to overcome resistance to tolerance in clinical transplantation."

Most domesticates have their origin in one of a few historic centers of domestication as farm animals. Two notable exceptions are cats and dogs. Wolf domestication was initiated late in the Mesolithic when humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Those wolves less afraid of humans scavenged nomadic hunting camps and over time developed utility, initially as guards warning of approaching animals or other nomadic bands and soon thereafter as hunters, an attribute tuned by artificial selection. The first domestic cats had limited utility and initiated their domestication among the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East. Wildcat domestication occurred through a self-selective process in which behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as a correlated character of assortative mating coupled to habitat choice for urban environments. Eurasian wildcats initiated domestication and their evolution to companion animals was initially a process of natural, rather than artificial, selection over time driven during their sympatry with forbear wildcats."
18547524,1,Genetics,374636,2009,Genome engineering-based analysis of Bearded family genes reveals both functional redundancy and a nonessential function in lateral inhibition in Drosophila.,"Lateral inhibition mediated by Notch receptor signaling regulates the determination of sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs) in Drosophila. The selection of SOPs from proneural cluster cells appears to rely on a negative feedback loop linking activation of the Notch receptor to downregulation of its ligand Delta within each cell. The molecular basis of this regulatory feedback mechanism is not known. Here, we have tested the role of the Bearded (Brd) family genes in this process. The Drosophila genome encodes eight Brd family members that interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized (Neur) and act as inhibitors of Neur-mediated Delta signaling. Genome engineering technologies were used to create specific deletions of all eight Brd family genes. We find that the Brd family genes malpha, m4, and m6 encoded by the Enhancer of split Complex (E(spl)-C) are dispensable for Drosophila development and that deletion of the five Brd family genes encoded by the Brd Complex only reduces viability. However, deletion of all Brd family genes results in embryonic lethality. Additionally, the malpha, m4, and m6 genes act redundantly with the other five Brd family genes to spatially restrict Notch activation in stage 5 embryos. These data reveal that the Brd family genes have an essential but redundant activity. While the activity of all eight Brd genes appears to be dispensable for SOP determination, clone border studies indicate that both the relative activity levels of Neur and Brd family members influence competition for the SOP fate during lateral inhibition. We propose that inhibition of Neur-Delta interaction by Brd family members is part of the feedback loop that underlies lateral inhibition in Drosophila."
18547528,1,Genes Dev.,8711660,2009,Metabolic intermediates selectively stimulate transcription factor interaction and modulate phosphate and purine pathways.,"Cells use strategic metabolites to sense the metabolome and accordingly modulate gene expression. Here, we show that the purine and phosphate pathways are positively regulated by the metabolic intermediate AICAR (5'-phosphoribosyl-5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide). The transcription factor Pho2p is required for up-regulation of all AICAR-responsive genes. Accordingly, the binding of Pho2p to purine and phosphate pathway gene promoters is enhanced upon AICAR accumulation. In vitro, AICAR binds both Pho2p and Pho4p transcription factors and stimulates the interaction between Pho2p and either Bas1p or Pho4p in vivo. In contrast, SAICAR (succinyl-AICAR) only affects Pho2p-Bas1p interaction and specifically up-regulates purine regulon genes. Together, our data show that Bas1p and Pho4p compete for Pho2p binding, hence leading to the concerted regulation of cellular nucleotide synthesis and phosphate consumption."

Cell Biol.,375356,2009,"HUMMR, a hypoxia- and HIF-1alpha-inducible protein, alters mitochondrial distribution and transport.","Mitochondrial transport is critical for maintenance of normal neuronal function. Here, we identify a novel mitochondria protein, hypoxia up-regulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR), which is expressed in neurons and is markedly induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). Interestingly, HUMMR interacts with Miro-1 and Miro-2, mitochondrial proteins that are critical for mediating mitochondrial transport. Interestingly, knockdown of HUMMR or HIF-1 function in neurons exposed to hypoxia markedly reduces mitochondrial content in axons. Because mitochondrial transport and distribution are inextricably linked, the impact of reduced HUMMR function on the direction of mitochondrial transport was also explored. Loss of HUMMR function in hypoxia diminished the percentage of motile mitochondria moving in the anterograde direction and enhanced the percentage moving in the retrograde direction. Thus, HUMMR, a novel mitochondrial protein induced by HIF-1 and hypoxia, biases mitochondria transport in the anterograde direction. These findings have broad implications for maintenance of neuronal viability and function during physiological and pathological states."

This phenomenon was induced after peptide immunotherapy in human asthmatic subjects and in a novel HLA-DR1 transgenic mouse model of asthma. Tracking of allergen-specific T cells using DR1 tetramers determined that suppression was associated with the induction of interleukin (IL)-10(+) T cells that were more abundant than T cells specific for the single-treatment peptide and was reversed by anti-IL-10 receptor administration. Resolution of airway pathophysiology in this model was associated with reduced recruitment, proliferation, and effector function of allergen-specific Th2 cells. Our results provide, for the first time, in vivo evidence of linked epitope suppression and IL-10 induction in both human allergic disease and a mouse model designed to closely mimic peptide therapy in humans."
18550812,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to oncogene-induced senescence.,"The expression of oncogenic ras in normal human cells quickly induces an aberrant proliferation response that later is curtailed by a cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence. Here, we show that cells expressing oncogenic ras display an increase in the mitochondrial mass, the mitochondrial DNA, and the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) prior to the senescent cell cycle arrest. By the time the cells entered senescence, dysfunctional mitochondria accumulated around the nucleus. The mitochondrial dysfunction was accompanied by oxidative DNA damage, a drop in ATP levels, and the activation of AMPK. The increase in mitochondrial mass and ROS in response to oncogenic ras depended on intact p53 and Rb tumor suppression pathways. In addition, direct interference with mitochondrial functions by inhibiting the expression of the Rieske iron sulfur protein of complex III or the use of pharmacological inhibitors of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation was sufficient to trigger senescence. Taking these results together, this work suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is an effector pathway of oncogene-induced senescence."

Biol.,8109087,2009,Hypoxia-inducible factor 2 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.,"In mammals, the liver integrates nutrient uptake and delivery of carbohydrates and lipids to peripheral tissues to control overall energy balance. Hepatocytes maintain metabolic homeostasis by coordinating gene expression programs in response to dietary and systemic signals. Hepatic tissue oxygenation is an important systemic signal that contributes to normal hepatocyte function as well as disease. Hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and HIF-2, respectively) are oxygen-sensitive heterodimeric transcription factors, which act as key mediators of cellular adaptation to low oxygen. Previously, we have shown that HIF-2 plays an important role in both physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in the liver. HIF-2 is essential for normal fetal EPO production and erythropoiesis, while constitutive HIF-2 activity in the adult results in polycythemia and vascular tumorigenesis. Here we report a novel role for HIF-2 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. We found that constitutive activation of HIF-2 in the adult results in the development of severe hepatic steatosis associated with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation, decreased lipogenic gene expression, and increased lipid storage capacity. These findings demonstrate that HIF-2 functions as an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism and identify HIF-2 as a potential target for the treatment of fatty liver disease."
18550821,1,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,Kinetics and phenotype of vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell responses to Toxoplasma gondii.,"Multiple studies have established that the ability of CD8(+) T cells to act as cytolytic effectors and produce gamma interferon is important in mediating resistance to the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. To better understand the generation of the antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses induced by T. gondii, mice were immunized with replication-deficient parasites that express the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Class I tetramers specific for SIINFEKL were used to track the OVA-specific endogenous CD8(+) T cells. The peak CD8(+) T-cell response was found at day 10 postimmunization, after which the frequency and numbers of antigen-specific cells declined. Unexpectedly, replication-deficient parasites were found to induce antigen-specific cells with faster kinetics than replicating parasites. The generation of optimal numbers of antigen-specific CD8(+) effector T cells was found to require CD4(+) T-cell help. At 7 days following immunization, antigen-specific cells were found to be CD62L(low), KLRG1(+), and CD127(low), and they maintained this phenotype for more than 70 days. Antigen-specific CD8(+) effector T cells in immunized mice exhibited potent perforin-dependent OVA-specific cytolytic activity in vivo. Perforin-dependent cytolysis appeared to be the major cytolytic mechanism; however, a perforin-independent pathway that was not mediated via Fas-FasL was also detected. This study provides further insight into vaccine-induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses that correlate with protective immunity to T. gondii and identifies a critical role for CD4(+) T cells in the generation of protective CD8(+) T-cell responses."
18550825,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Overestimation of alternative splicing caused by variable probe characteristics in exon arrays.,"In higher eukaryotes, alternative splicing is a common mechanism for increasing transcriptome diversity. Affymetrix exon arrays were designed as a tool for monitoring the relative expression levels of hundreds of thousands of known and predicted exons with a view to detecting alternative splicing events. In this article, we have analyzed exon array data from many different human and mouse tissues and have uncovered a systematic relationship between transcript-fold change and alternative splicing as reported by the splicing index. Evidence from dilution experiments and deep sequencing suggest that this effect is of technical rather than biological origin and that it is driven by sequence features of the probes. This effect is substantial and results in a 12-fold overestimation of alternative splicing events in genes that are differentially expressed. By cross-species exon array comparison, we could further show that the systematic bias persists even across species boundaries. Failure to consider this effect in data analysis would result in the reproducible false detection of apparently conserved alternative splicing events. Finally, we have developed a software in R called COSIE (Corrected Splicing Indices for Exon arrays) that for any given set of new exon array experiments corrects for the observed bias and improves the detection of alternative splicing (available at www.fmi.ch/groups/gbioinfo)."
18550827,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Translation of intronless RNAs is strongly stimulated by the Epstein-Barr virus mRNA export factor EB2.,"The Epstein-Barr virus protein (EB2) allows the nuclear export of a particular subset of early and late viral RNAs derived from intronless genes. EB2 is conserved among most herpesvirus members and its presence is essential for the production of infectious particles. Here we show that, besides its role as a nuclear export factor, EB2 strongly stimulates translation of unspliced mRNAs without affecting overall cellular translation. Interestingly, this effect can be reversed by the addition of an intron within the gene. The spliced mRNA is then efficiently exported and translated even in the absence of EB2. Moreover, we show that EB2 associates with translating ribosomes and increases the proportion of its target RNA in the polyribosomal fraction. Finally, testing of EB2 homolog proteins derived from EBV-related herpesviruses, shows that, even if they play similar roles within the replication cycle of their respective virus, their mechanisms of action are different."

We examined (a) whether these effects are additive, and (b) whether other fatty acid transporters (FABPpm, FATP1, FATP4, and FATP6) are also induced to translocate. Insulin and muscle contraction increased glucose transport and plasmalemmal GLUT4 independently and additively (positive control). Palmitate transport was also stimulated independently and additively by insulin and by muscle contraction. Insulin and muscle contraction increased plasmalemmal FAT/CD36, FABPpm, FATP1, and FATP4, but not FATP6. Only FAT/CD36 and FATP1 were stimulated in an additive manner by insulin and by muscle contraction."
18550837,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,"Unlike PPARgamma, PPARalpha or PPARbeta/delta activation does not promote human monocyte differentiation toward alternative macrophages.","Macrophages adapt their response to micro-environmental signals. While Th1 cytokines promote pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, Th2 cytokines promote an &quot;alternative&quot; anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors expressed in macrophages where they control the inflammatory response. It has been shown that PPARgamma promotes the differentiation of monocytes into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in humans and mice, while a role for PPARbeta/delta in this process has been reported only in mice and no data are available for PPARalpha. Here, we show that in contrast to PPARgamma, expression of PPARalpha and PPARbeta/delta overall does not correlate with the expression of M2 markers in human atherosclerotic lesions, whereas a positive correlation with genes of lipid metabolism exists. Moreover, unlike PPARgamma, PPARalpha or PPARbeta/delta activation does not influence human monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages in vitro. Thus, PPARalpha and PPARbeta/delta do not appear to modulate the alternative differentiation of human macrophages."
18550842,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,New TFII-I family target genes involved in embryonic development.,"Two members of the TFII-I family transcription factor genes, GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, are the prime candidates responsible for the craniofacial and cognitive abnormalities of Williams syndrome patients. We have previously generated mouse lines with targeted disruption of Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in the expression profile of mutant embryos. Here we described three unknown genes that were dramatically down-regulated in mutants. The 2410018M08Rik/Scand3 gene encodes a protein of unknown function with CHCH and hATC domains. Scand3 is down-regulated during mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) differentiation. 4933436H12Rik is a testis-specific gene, which encodes a protein with no known domains. It is expressed in mouse ES cells. 1110008P08Rik/Kbtbd7 encodes an adapter protein with BTB/POZ, BACK, and Kelch motifs, previously shown to recruit substrates to the enzymatic complexes of the histone modifying or E3 ubiquitin ligase activities. Based on its expression pattern Kbtbd7 may have a specific role in brain development and function. All three genes possess well-conserved TFII-I-binding consensus sites within proximal promoters. Therefore our analysis suggests that these genes can be direct targets of TFII-I proteins and their impaired expression, as a result of the GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 haploinsufficiency, could contribute to the etiology of Williams syndrome."
18551131,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Stochastic actin polymerization and steady retrograde flow determine growth cone advancement.,"Neuronal growth is an extremely complex yet reliable process that is directed by a dynamic lamellipodial structure at the tip of every growing neurite, called the growth cone. Lamellipodial edge fluctuations are controlled by the interplay between actin polymerization pushing the edge forward and molecular motor driven retrograde actin flow retracting the actin network. The leading edge switches randomly between extension and retraction processes. We identify switching of &quot;on/off&quot; states in actin polymerization as the main determinant of lamellipodial advancement. Our analysis of motility statistics allows for a prediction of growth direction. This was used in simulations explaining the amazing signal detection capabilities of neuronal growth by the experimentally found biased stochastic processes. Our measurements show that the intensity of stochastic fluctuations depend on changes in the underlying active intracellular processes and we find a power law eta = a*x(alpha) with exponent alpha = 2.63 +/- 0.12 between noise intensity eta and growth cone activity x, defined as the sum of protrusion and retraction velocity. Differences in the lamellipodial dynamics between primary neurons and a neuronal cell line further suggests that active processes tune the observed stochastic fluctuations. This hints at a possible role of noise intensity in determining signal detection sensitivity."

J.,370626,2009,"Profilin interaction with phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate destabilizes the membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles.","Profilin, a small cytoskeletal protein, and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] have been implicated in cellular events that alter the cell morphology, such as endocytosis, cell motility, and formation of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Profilin has been shown to interact with PI(4,5)P2, but the role of this interaction is still poorly understood. Using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a simple model of the cell membrane, we investigated the interaction between profilin and PI(4,5)P2. A number and brightness analysis demonstrated that in the absence of profilin, molar ratios of PI(4,5)P2 above 4% result in lipid demixing and cluster formations. Furthermore, adding profilin to GUVs made with 1% PI(4,5)P2 leads to the formation of clusters of both profilin and PI(4,5)P2. However, due to the self-quenching of the dipyrrometheneboron difluoride-labeled PI(4,5)P2, we were unable to determine the size of these clusters. Finally, we show that the formation of these clusters results in the destabilization and deformation of the GUV membrane."

J.,370626,2009,From powder to solution: hydration dependence of human hemoglobin dynamics correlated to body temperature.,"A transition in hemoglobin (Hb), involving partial unfolding and aggregation, has been shown previously by various biophysical methods. The correlation between the transition temperature and body temperature for Hb from different species, suggested that it might be significant for biological function. To focus on such biologically relevant human Hb dynamics, we studied the protein internal picosecond motions as a response to hydration, by elastic and quasielastic neutron scattering. Rates of fast diffusive motions were found to be significantly enhanced with increasing hydration from fully hydrated powder to concentrated Hb solution. In concentrated protein solution, the data showed that amino acid side chains can explore larger volumes above body temperature than expected from normal temperature dependence. The body temperature transition in protein dynamics was absent in fully hydrated powder, indicating that picosecond protein dynamics responsible for the transition is activated only at a sufficient level of hydration. A collateral result from the study is that fully hydrated protein powder samples do not accurately describe all aspects of protein picosecond dynamics that might be necessary for biological function."
18552202,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Binding thermodynamics of ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase: two different protein substrates and one energetics.,"The thermodynamics of the formation of binary and ternary complexes between Anabaena PCC 7119 FNR and its substrates, NADP+ and Fd, or Fld, has been studied by ITC. Despite structural dissimilarities, the main difference between Fd and Fld binding to FNR relates to hydrophobicity, reflected in different binding heat capacity and number of water molecules released from the interface. At pH 8, the formation of the binary complexes is both enthalpically and entropically driven, accompanied by the protonation of at least one ionizable group. His299 FNR has been identified as the main responsible for the proton exchange observed. However, at pH 10, where no protonation occurs and intrinsic binding parameters can be obtained, the formation of the binary complexes is entropically driven, with negligible enthalpic contribution. Absence of the FMN cofactor in Fld does not alter significantly the strength of the interaction, but considerably modifies the enthalpic and entropic contributions, suggesting a different binding mode. Ternary complexes show negative cooperativity (6-fold and 11-fold reduction in binding affinity, respectively), and an increase in the enthalpic contribution (more favorable) and a decrease in the entropic contribution (less favorable), with regard to the binary complexes energetics."
18555774,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Theory of raft formation by the cross-linking of saturated or unsaturated lipids in model lipid bilayers.,"We consider the effect of cross-linking a small fraction of lipids, either saturated or unsaturated, in a mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids and cholesterol. The change in phase behavior is examined utilizing a recent phenomenological model of the ternary system, which is extended to include a fourth component representing the cross-linked lipids. These lipids are taken to be identical to monomeric ones except for their reduced entropy of mixing. We find that even a relatively small amount of cross-linked lipids, less than 5 mol %, is sufficient to significantly expand the range of compositions within which there is coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. Equivalently, the cross-linking of lipids increases the liquid-liquid miscibility transition temperature, and therefore could bring about phase separation at a temperature at which, before cross-linking, there was only a single liquid phase."

J.,370626,2009,Reversible formation of nanodomains in monolayers of DPPC studied by kinetic modeling.,"Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is the most abundant component in pulmonary surfactants and is believed to be responsible for maintaining low surface tension in alveoli during breathing. In this work, a kinetic model is introduced that describes the phase separation in DPPC films that produces the liquid-condensed (LC) and liquid-expanded (LE) fractions, which differ according to the area density of DPPC. The phase separation in an initially homogeneous film has been investigated numerically. Furthermore, explicit simulations of periodic compression-expansion cycles are reported. In this process, a moderate change of the surface area resulted in a dramatic change in the total amount of LC fraction, as well as in the surface morphology. Depending on the extent of the film's compression, the simulated surface morphologies comprised individual nanosized LC domains embedded in the LE fraction, interconnected networks of such domains, or continuous LC films with nanopores. Equilibration of the total area of the LC nanodomains occurred over a few milliseconds, indicating that the rate of the LE-LC phase transformation is sufficient for maintaining low surface tension during breathing, and that nanoscale LC domains are likely to play a major role in this process. Unlike the total content of the LC fraction, which stabilized quickly, the average size of LC nanodomains showed a tendency to increase slowly, at a rate determined by the diffusivity of DPPC. The computed average domain size seems to be compatible with published experiments for DPPC films. The numeric results also elucidate the distinction between thermodynamically determined and kinetically limited structural properties during phase separation in the major structure-forming component of pulmonary surfactants."

J.,370626,2009,Study of Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase in the presence of tributyrylglycerol and water.,"The Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase has been extensively studied in industrial and biotechnological research because of its potential for triacylglycerol transformation. This protein is known to catalyze both hydrolysis at high water contents and transesterification in quasi-anhydrous conditions. Here, we investigated the Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase structure in solution in the presence of a tributyrin aggregate using 30 ns molecular-dynamics simulations. The water content of the active-site groove was modified between the runs to focus on the protein-water molecule interactions and their implications for protein structure and protein-lipid interactions. The simulations confirmed the high plasticity of the lid fragment and showed that lipid molecules also bind to a secondary pocket beside the lid. Together, these results strongly suggest that the lid plays a role in the anchoring of the protein to the aggregate. The simulations also revealed the existence of a polar channel that connects the active-site groove to the outside solvent. At the inner extremity of this channel, a tyrosine makes hydrogen bonds with residues interacting with the catalytic triad. This system could function as a pipe (polar channel) controlled by a valve (the tyrosine) that could regulate the water content of the active site."
18559859,1,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,Colorectal carcinomas in MUTYH-associated polyposis display histopathological similarities to microsatellite unstable carcinomas.,"BACKGROUND: MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is a recessively inherited disorder which predisposes biallelic carriers for a high risk of polyposis and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Since about one third of the biallelic MAP patients in population based CRC series has no adenomas, this study aimed to identify specific clinicopathological characteristics of MAP CRCs and compare these with reported data on sporadic and Lynch CRCs. METHODS: From 44 MAP patients who developed &gt; or = 1 CRCs, 42 of 58 tumours were analyzed histologically and 35 immunohistochemically for p53 and beta-catenin. Cell densities of CD3, CD8, CD57, and granzyme B positive lymphocytes were determined. KRAS2, the mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC, p53, and SMAD4 were analyzed for somatic mutations. RESULTS: MAP CRCs frequently localized to the proximal colon (69%, 40/58), were mucinous in 21% (9/42), and had a conspicuous Crohn's like infiltrate reaction in 33% (13/40); all of these parameters occurred at a higher rate than reported for sporadic CRCs. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were also highly prevalent in MAP CRCs. Somatic APC MCR mutations occurred in 14% (5/36) while 64% (23/36) had KRAS2 mutations (22/23 c.34G&gt;T). G&gt;T transversions were found in p53 and SMAD4, although the relative frequency compared to other mutations was low. CONCLUSION: MAP CRCs show some similarities to micro-satellite unstable cancers, with a preferential proximal location, a high rate of mucinous histotype and increased presence of TILs. These features should direct the practicing pathologist towards a MAP aetiology of CRC as an alternative for a mismatch repair deficient cause. High frequent G&gt;T transversions in APC and KRAS2 (mutated in early tumour development) but not in P53 and SMAD4 (implicated in tumour progression) might indicate a predominant MUTYH effect in early carcinogenesis."
18562278,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Identification of the plasticity-relevant fucose-alpha(1-2)-galactose proteome from the mouse olfactory bulb.,"Fucose-alpha(1-2)-galactose [Fucalpha(1-2)Gal] sugars have been implicated in the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal development, learning, and memory. However, an understanding of their precise roles has been hampered by a lack of information regarding Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins. Here, we report the first proteomic studies of this plasticity-relevant epitope. We identify five classes of putative Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins: cell adhesion molecules, ion channels and solute carriers/transporters, ATP-binding proteins, synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, and mitochondrial proteins. In addition, we show that Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins are enriched in the developing mouse olfactory bulb (OB) and exhibit a distinct spatiotemporal expression that is consistent with the presence of a &quot;glycocode&quot; to help direct olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal pathfinding. We find that expression of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal sugars in the OB is regulated by the alpha(1-2)fucosyltransferase FUT1. FUT1-deficient mice exhibit developmental defects, including fewer and smaller glomeruli and a thinner olfactory nerve layer, suggesting that fucosylation contributes to OB development. Our findings significantly expand the number of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which fucosyl sugars contribute to neuronal processes."

Soc.,7503056,2009,&quot;Clickable&quot; polymer-caged nanobins as a modular drug delivery platform.,"Modularly clickable polymer-caged nanobins (PCNs) were prepared from liposome templates using a drop-in cholesterol-modified poly(acrylic acid) reagent followed by cross-linking with alkyne-functionalized diamine linker that allows for the conjugation of azide-modified targeting ligands via click ligation. These PCNs possess pH-responsive characteristics that can be used to trigger the release of encapsulated doxorubicin (DXR) payload inside the liposomal core under mild acidic conditions. After click-conjugation with azide-modified folate as an active targeting ligand, the resulting folate-conjugated, DXR-loaded PCNs (f-PCN(DXR)) demonstrated enhanced potency to folate receptor (FR)-positive tumor cells such as KB and OvCa432 over FR-negative MCF7 cells. f-PCN(DXR) can readily discriminate FR-positive tumor cells as a function of the level of cellular FR-expression, showing different degrees of potentiation in each cell. With both targeting functionalities and pH-sensitive drug-releasing triggers, f-PCN(DXR) was fifty-times more potent than the untargeted agent toward cancer cells that overexpress the folate target receptors."

18566586,1,Proteomics,101092707,2009,A proteomic study of pectin-degrading enzymes secreted by Botrytis cinerea grown in liquid culture.,"Botrytis cinerea is a pathogenic filamentous fungus, which infects more than 200 plant species. The enzymes secreted by B. cinerea play an important role in the successful colonization of a host plant. Some of the secreted enzymes are involved in the degradation of pectin, a major component of the plant cell wall. A total of 126 proteins secreted by B. cinerea were identified by growing the fungus on highly or partially esterified pectin, or on sucrose in liquid culture. Sixty-seven common proteins were identified in each of the growth conditions, of which 50 proteins exhibited a SignalP motif. Thirteen B. cinerea proteins with functions related to pectin degradation were identified in both pectin growth conditions, while only four were identified in sucrose. Our results indicate it is unlikely that the activation of B. cinerea from the dormant state to active infection is solely dependent on changes in the degree of esterification of the pectin component of the plant cell wall. Further, these results suggest that future studies of the B. cinerea secretome in infections of ripe and unripe fruits will provide important information that will describe the mechanisms that the fungus employs to access nutrients and decompose tissues."
18566587,1,Proteomics,101092707,2009,Proteomic analysis of Brucella suis under oxygen deficiency reveals flexibility in adaptive expression of various pathways.,"Low oxygen tension was proposed to be one of the environmental parameters characteristic of the patho-physiological conditions of natural infections by Brucella suis. We previously showed that various respiratory pathways may be used by B. suis in response to microaerobiosis and anaerobiosis. Here, we compare the whole proteome of B. suis exposed to such low-oxygenated conditions to that obtained from bacteria grown under ambient air using 2-D DIGE. Data showed that the reduction of basal metabolism was in line with low or absence of growth of B. suis. Under both microaerobiosis and anaerobiosis, glycolysis and denitrification were favored. In addition, fatty acid oxidation and possibly citrate fermentation could also contribute to energy production sufficient for survival under anaerobiosis. When oxygen availability changed and became limiting, basic metabolic processes were still functional and variability of respiratory pathways was observed to a degree unexpected for a strictly aerobic microorganism. This highly flexible respiration probably constitutes an advantage for the survival of Brucella under the restricted oxygenation conditions encountered within host tissue."
18566590,1,Oncogene,8711562,2009,The Ste20-like kinase SLK is required for ErbB2-driven breast cancer cell motility.,"The Ste20-like kinase, SLK, is involved in the control of cell motility through its effects on actin reorganization and focal adhesion turnover. Here we investigated the role of SLK in chemotaxis downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor, HER2/ErbB2/Neu, which is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers. Our results show that SLK is required for the efficient cell migration of human and mouse mammary epithelial cell lines in the presence of the Neu activator, heregulin, as a chemoattractant. SLK activity is stimulated by heregulin treatment or by overexpression of activated Neu. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1201 or tyrosines 1226/7 on Neu is a key event for SLK activation and cell migration, and cancer cell invasion mediated by these tyrosines is inhibited by kinase-inactive SLK. Signaling pathway inhibitors show that Neu-mediated SLK activation is dependent on MEK, PI3K, PLCgamma and Shc signaling. Furthermore, heregulin-stimulated SLK activity requires signals from the focal adhesion proteins, FAK and src. Finally, phospho-FAK analysis shows that SLK is required for Neu-dependent focal adhesion turnover. Together, these studies define an interaction between Neu and SLK signaling in the regulation of cancer cell motility."

This method is sufficiently accurate to investigate the heterogeneity of single cells.

Methods,101215604,2009,Mapping the structure and conformational movements of proteins with transition metal ion FRET.,"Visualizing conformational dynamics in proteins has been difficult, and the atomic-scale motions responsible for the behavior of most allosteric proteins are unknown. Here we report that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a small fluorescent dye and a nickel ion bound to a dihistidine motif can be used to monitor small structural rearrangements in proteins. This method provides several key advantages over classical FRET, including the ability to measure the dynamics of close-range interactions, the use of small probes with short linkers, a low orientation dependence, and the ability to add and remove unique tunable acceptors. We used this 'transition metal ion FRET' approach along with X-ray crystallography to determine the structural changes of the gating ring of the mouse hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channel HCN2. Our results suggest a general model for the conformational switch in the cyclic nucleotide-binding site of cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels."
18571423,1,Nat. Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,SDPR induces membrane curvature and functions in the formation of caveolae.,"Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations with a characteristic flask-shaped morphology. They function in diverse cellular processes, including endocytosis. The mechanism by which caveolae are generated is not fully understood, but both caveolin proteins and PTRF (polymerase I and transcript release factor, also known as cavin) are important. Here we show that loss of SDPR (serum deprivation protein response) causes loss of caveolae. SDPR binds directly to PTRF and recruits PTRF to caveolar membranes. Overexpression of SDPR, unlike PTRF, induces deformation of caveolae and extensive tubulation of the plasma membrane. The B-subunit of Shiga toxin (STB) also induces membrane tubulation and these membrane tubes also originate from caveolae. STB colocalizes extensively with both SDPR and caveolin 1. Loss of caveolae reduces the propensity of STB to induce membrane tubulation. We conclude that SDPR is a membrane-curvature-inducing component of caveolae, and that STB-induced membrane tubulation is facilitated by caveolae."

Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,Chromosome congression in the absence of kinetochore fibres.,"Proper chromosome congression (the process of aligning chromosomes on the spindle) contributes to accurate and faithful chromosome segregation. It is widely accepted that congression requires kinetochore fibres (K-fibres), microtubule bundles that extend from the kinetochores to spindle poles. Here, we demonstrate that chromosomes in human cells co-depleted of HSET (human kinesin-14) and hNuf2 (human Ndc80/Hec1-complex component) can congress to the metaphase plate in the absence of K-fibres. However, the chromosomes are not stably maintained at the metaphase plate under these conditions. Chromosome congression in HSET + hNuf2 co-depleted cells required the plus-end directed motor CENP-E (centromere protein E; kinesin-7 family member), which has been implicated in the gliding of mono-oriented kinetochores alongside adjacent K-fibres. Thus, proper end-on attachment of kinetochores to microtubules is not necessary for chromosome congression. Instead, our data support the idea that congression allows unattached chromosomes to move to the middle of the spindle where they have a higher probability of establishing connections with both spindle poles. These bi-oriented connections are also used to maintain stable chromosome alignment at the spindle equator."
18574155,1,Nature,410462,2009,CD14 regulates the dendritic cell life cycle after LPS exposure through NFAT activation.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best characterized pattern recognition receptors. Individual TLRs recruit diverse combinations of adaptor proteins, triggering signal transduction pathways and leading to the activation of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappaB, activation protein 1 and interferon regulatory factors. Interleukin-2 is one of the molecules produced by mouse dendritic cells after stimulation by different pattern recognition receptor agonists. By analogy with the events after T-cell receptor engagement leading to interleukin-2 production, it is therefore plausible that the stimulation of TLRs on dendritic cells may lead to activation of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway. Here we show that mouse dendritic cell stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase Cgamma2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca(2+) and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation. The initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. We also show that LPS-induced NFAT activation via CD14 is necessary to cause the apoptotic death of terminally differentiated dendritic cells, an event that is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Consequently, blocking this pathway in vivo causes prolonged dendritic cell survival and an increase in T-cell priming capability. Our findings reveal novel aspects of molecular signalling triggered by LPS in dendritic cells, and identify a new role for CD14: the regulation of the dendritic cell life cycle through NFAT activation. Given the involvement of CD14 in disease, including sepsis and chronic heart failure, the discovery of signal transduction pathways activated exclusively via CD14 is an important step towards the development of potential treatments involving interference with CD14 functions."
18577522,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,A cell wall-degrading esterase of Xanthomonas oryzae requires a unique substrate recognition module for pathogenesis on rice.,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice (Oryza sativa). LipA is a secretory virulence factor of Xoo, implicated in degradation of rice cell walls and the concomitant elicitation of innate immune responses, such as callose deposition and programmed cell death. Here, we present the high-resolution structural characterization of LipA that reveals an all-helical ligand binding module as a distinct functional attachment to the canonical hydrolase catalytic domain. We demonstrate that the enzyme binds to a glycoside ligand through a rigid pocket comprising distinct carbohydrate-specific and acyl chain recognition sites where the catalytic triad is situated 15 A from the anchored carbohydrate. Point mutations disrupting the carbohydrate anchor site or blocking the pocket, even at a considerable distance from the enzyme active site, can abrogate in planta LipA function, exemplified by loss of both virulence and the ability to elicit host defense responses. A high conservation of the module across genus Xanthomonas emphasizes the significance of this unique plant cell wall-degrading function for this important group of plant pathogenic bacteria. A comparison with the related structural families illustrates how a typical lipase is recruited to act on plant cell walls to promote virulence, thus providing a remarkable example of the emergence of novel functions around existing scaffolds for increased proficiency of pathogenesis during pathogen-plant coevolution."
18579758,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Inactivation of CDK2 is synthetically lethal to MYCN over-expressing cancer cells.,"Two genes have a synthetically lethal relationship when the silencing or inhibiting of 1 gene is only lethal in the context of a mutation or activation of the second gene. This situation offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, as inhibition of such a gene will only trigger cell death in tumor cells with an activated second oncogene but spare normal cells without activation of the second oncogene. Here we present evidence that CDK2 is synthetically lethal to neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification and over-expression. Neuroblastomas are childhood tumors with an often lethal outcome. Twenty percent of the tumors have MYCN amplification, and these tumors are ultimately refractory to any therapy. Targeted silencing of CDK2 by 3 RNA interference techniques induced apoptosis in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, but not in MYCN single copy cells. Silencing of MYCN abrogated this apoptotic response in MYCN-amplified cells. Inversely, silencing of CDK2 in MYCN single copy cells did not trigger apoptosis, unless a MYCN transgene was activated. The MYCN induced apoptosis after CDK2 silencing was accompanied by nuclear stabilization of P53, and mRNA profiling showed up-regulation of P53 target genes. Silencing of P53 rescued the cells from MYCN-driven apoptosis. The synthetic lethality of CDK2 silencing in MYCN activated neuroblastoma cells can also be triggered by inhibition of CDK2 with a small molecule drug. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with roscovitine, a CDK inhibitor, at clinically achievable concentrations induced MYCN-dependent apoptosis. The synthetically lethal relationship between CDK2 and MYCN indicates CDK2 inhibitors as potential MYCN-selective cancer therapeutics."

18579787,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,A novel cation-dependent O-methyltransferase involved in anthocyanin methylation in grapevine.,"Anthocyanins are major pigments in colored grape (Vitis vinifera) berries, and most of them are monomethoxylated or dimethoxylated. We report here the functional characterization of an anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT) from grapevine. The expression pattern in two cultivars with different anthocyanin methylation profiles (Syrah and Nebbiolo) showed a peak at start ripening (véraison), when the concentrations of all methylated anthocyanins begin to increase. The purified recombinant AOMT protein was active on both anthocyanins and flavonols in vitro, with K(m) in the micromolar range, and was dependent on divalent cations for activity. AOMT showed a preference for 3',5' methylation when a 3',4',5' hydroxylated anthocyanin substrate was tested. In order to assess its in planta activity, we performed transient expression of AOMT in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves expressing the Production of Anthocyanin Pigment1 (PAP1) transcription factor from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PAP1 expression in leaves induced the accumulation of the nonmethylated anthocyanin delphinidin 3-rutinoside. The coexpression of PAP1 and AOMT resulted in an accumulation of malvidin 3-rutinoside. We also showed that AOMT localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of tobacco leaf cells. These results demonstrate the ability of this enzyme to methylate anthocyanins both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that AOMT plays a major role in anthocyanin biosynthesis in grape berries."
18583477,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Adenomatous polyposis coli and Asef function downstream of hepatocyte growth factor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.,"Mutations of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are responsible for sporadic and familial colorectal tumors. APC negatively regulates Wnt signaling by inducing beta-catenin degradation. It has also been shown that APC plays a role in the organization of cytoskeletal networks. APC interacts with Asef and Asef2, Rac1- and Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and stimulates their GEF activity; thereby regulating cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. Truncated mutant APCs present in colorectal tumor cells activate Asef and Asef2 constitutively and contribute to their aberrant migratory properties. We show here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), induce the accumulation and colocalization of APC and Asef in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia of epithelial cells. Both APC and Asef were found to be required for HGF-induced cell migration. Furthermore, we show that the effects of HGF, bFGF, and EGF on APC and Asef are mediated by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and require the PH domain of Asef. These results suggest that Asef and APC function downstream of HGF and PI3-kinase, and play critical roles in growth factor-mediated regulation of cell morphology and migration."
18583959,1,Virology,110674,2009,A quick fuse and the emergence of Taura syndrome virus.,"Over the last two decades, Taura syndrome virus (TSV) has emerged as a major pathogen in penaeid shrimp aquaculture and has caused substantial economic loss. The disease was first discovered in Ecuador in 1991, and the virus is now globally distributed with the greatest concentration of infections in the Americas and Southeast Asia. To determine the evolutionary history of this virus, we constructed a phylogeny containing 83 TSV isolates from 16 countries sampled over a 16-year period. This phylogeny was inferred using a relaxed molecular clock in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. We found phylogenetic evidence that the TSV epidemic did indeed originate in the Americas sometime around 1991 (1988-1993). We estimated the TSV nucleotide substitution rate at 2.37 x 10(-3) (1.98 x 10(-3) to 2.82 x 10(-3)) substitutions/site/year within capsid gene 2. In addition, the phylogeny was able to independently corroborate many of the suspected routes of TSV transmission around the world. Finally, we asked whether TSV emergence in new geographic locations operates under a quick fuse (i.e. rapid appearance of widespread disease). Using a relaxed molecular clock, we determined that TSV is almost always discovered within a year of entering a new region. This suggests that current monitoring programs are effective at detecting novel TSV outbreaks."

Cell,9802571,2009,H3K4me3 stimulates the V(D)J RAG complex for both nicking and hairpinning in trans in addition to tethering in cis: implications for translocations.,"The PHD finger of the RAG2 polypeptide of the RAG1/RAG2 complex binds to the histone H3 modification, trimethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and in some manner increases V(D)J recombination. In the absence of biochemical studies of H3K4me3 on purified RAG enzyme activity, the precise role of H3K4me3 remains unclear. Here, we find that H3K4me3 stimulates purified RAG enzymatic activity at both the nicking (2- to 5-fold) and hairpinning (3- to 11-fold) steps of V(D)J recombination. Remarkably, this stimulation can be achieved with free H3K4me3 peptide (in trans), indicating that H3K4me3 functions via two distinct mechanisms. It not only tethers the RAG enzyme complex to a region of DNA, but it also induces a substantial increase in the catalytic turnover number (k(cat)) of the RAG complex. The H3K4me3 catalytic stimulation applies to suboptimal cryptic RSS sites located at H3K4me3 peaks that are critical in the inception of human T cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas."

In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of RVB-containing complexes and their role in these pathways."
18585350,1,Neuron,8809320,2009,Neural activity regulates synaptic properties and dendritic structure in vivo through calcineurin/NFAT signaling.,"The calcium-regulated protein phosphatase Calcineurin (CaN) participates in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of transcription factors, including Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). To understand how CaN contributes to neuronal circuit development, whole-cell mEPSC recordings and multiphoton imaging were performed in the visual system of living Xenopus laevis tadpoles electroporated to express either a CaN phosphatase inhibitor or N-VIVIT, a nuclear localization sequence-tagged VIVIT peptide that blocks the binding of CaN to select substrates including NFAT. Both strategies increased mEPSC frequency and dendritic arbor complexity in tectal neurons over 3 days. Expression of either of two constitutively active Xenopus NFATs (CA-NFATs) restored normal synaptic properties in neurons expressing N-VIVIT. However, the morphological phenotype was only rescued by a CA-NFAT bearing an intact regulatory domain, implying that transcriptional control of morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons is mediated by distinct NFAT interactions."
18585351,1,Cell,413066,2009,Functional depletion of mahogunin by cytosolically exposed prion protein contributes to neurodegeneration.,"The pathways leading from aberrant Prion protein (PrP) metabolism to neurodegeneration are poorly understood. Some familial PrP mutants generate increased (Ctm)PrP, a transmembrane isoform associated with disease. In other disease situations, a potentially toxic cytosolic form (termed cyPrP) might be produced. However, the mechanisms by which (Ctm)PrP or cyPrP cause selective neuronal dysfunction are unknown. Here, we show that both (Ctm)PrP and cyPrP can interact with and disrupt the function of Mahogunin (Mgrn), a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase whose loss causes spongiform neurodegeneration. Cultured cells and transgenic mice expressing either (Ctm)PrP-producing mutants or cyPrP partially phenocopy Mgrn depletion, displaying aberrant lysosomal morphology and loss of Mgrn in selected brain regions. These effects were rescued by either Mgrn overexpression, competition for PrP-binding sites, or prevention of cytosolic PrP exposure. Thus, transient or partial exposure of PrP to the cytosol leads to inappropriate Mgrn sequestration that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and disease."
18585354,1,Cell,413066,2009,Phosphorylation-driven assembly of the RIP1-RIP3 complex regulates programmed necrosis and virus-induced inflammation.,"Programmed necrosis is a form of caspase-independent cell death whose molecular regulation is poorly understood. The kinase RIP1 is crucial for programmed necrosis, but also mediates activation of the prosurvival transcription factor NF-kappaB. We postulated that additional molecules are required to specifically activate programmed necrosis. Using a RNA interference screen, we identified the kinase RIP3 as a crucial activator for programmed necrosis induced by TNF and during virus infection. RIP3 regulates necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 stabilizes their association within the pronecrotic complex, activates the pronecrotic kinase activity, and triggers downstream reactive oxygen species production. The pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex is induced during vaccinia virus infection. Consequently, RIP3(-/-) mice exhibited severely impaired virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. Our findings suggest that RIP3 controls programmed necrosis by initiating the pronecrotic kinase cascade, and that this is necessary for the inflammatory response against virus infections."

18587049,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,The basic residue cluster (55)KKWVR(59) in CCL5 is required for in vivo biologic function.,"Chemokine function in vivo depends on the presentation by structures of the extracellular matrix or on endothelial surfaces. CCL5 contains two clusters of basic amino acid residues ((44)RKNR(47) and (55)KKWVR(59)) implicated in presentation of the protein. While (44)RKNR(47) has been shown to moderate CCL5 binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), no direct role for the basic residues in the so called 50s loop ((55)KKWVR(59)) as a presentation structure has been published to date. In ex vivo studies both regions were found to be necessary for direct tissue binding suggesting a role for (55)KKWVR(59). In vitroT lymphocyte and monocyte induced firm adhesion under flow, as well as leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity in vivo was reduced in the 50s mutant. The binding of the 50s mutant to endothelial cells was significantly reduced as compared to the wild type protein demonstrated by ELISA. The 50s mutant had little impact on GAG binding in vitro. These data suggest that functional CCL5 presentation is mediated through both the 40s as well as the 50s loop with differential functions of the two loops of clusters of basic residues."

Cdk5 regulates neuronal migration, differentiation, axonogenesis, synaptic transmission and apoptosis. However, its role in motor neuron development remains unexplored. Here, using gain and loss-of-function analyses in developing zebrafish embryos, we report that cdk5 plays a critical role in spinal and cranial motor neuron development. Cdk5 knockdown results in supernumerary spinal and cranial motor neurons. While a dominant negative, kinase-dead cdk5 promotes the generation of supernumerary motor neurons; over-expression of cdk5 suppresses motor neuron development. Thus, modulating cdk5 activity seems promising in inducing motor neuron development in vivo."

In the present study, we have designed and synthesized phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) with self-complementary sequences that form duplex structures with either 3'- or 5'-overhanging sequences. We studied the new ORNs for their duplex formation, nuclease stability, and ability to induce immune-stimulatory activate through TLR7 and TLR8 in TLR-transfected cell lines, human PBMCs, human pDCs, and in vivo in mice. Thermal melting and gel electrophoresis studies showed that all ORNs formed secondary structures and that the thermal stability of the duplex is depended on the length and GC composition of the duplex. Nuclease stability of ORNs increased with increasing thermal stability of the duplex formed. All ORN showed TLR8 activity in HEK293 cells, and induced cytokine and chemokine production in human PBMC cultures. In addition to TLR8 activity, two ORNs containing a 'CUGAAUU' motif in the duplex-forming region induced immune stimulation through TLR7 in HEK293 cells, human PBMC and pDC cultures, and in vivo in mice. These results suggest that secondary structures in ORN provide nuclease stability and lead to stimulation of immune responses through TLR8 as well as TLR7 depending on the presence of specific nucleotide motifs."
18591661,1,Immunity,9432918,2009,Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein regulates interferon-mediated innate immunity.,"Interferons (IFNs) direct innate and acquired immune responses and, accordingly, are used therapeutically to treat a number of diseases, yet the diverse effects they elicit are not fully understood. Here, we identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulated an association of PLZF with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice had a specific ISG expression defect and as a result were more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFN signaling and the induction of innate antiviral immunity."
18591664,1,Curr. Biol.,9107782,2009,Lateralized gustatory behavior of C. elegans is controlled by specific receptor-type guanylyl cyclases.,"BACKGROUND: Even though functional lateralization is a common feature of many nervous systems, it is poorly understood how lateralized neural function is linked to lateralized gene activity. A bilaterally symmetric pair of C. elegans gustatory neurons, ASEL and ASER, senses a number of chemicals in a left/right asymmetric manner and therefore serves as a model to study the genetic basis of functional lateralization. The extent of functional lateralization of the ASE neurons and genes responsible for the left/right asymmetric activity of ASEL and ASER is unknown. RESULTS: We show here that a substantial number of salt ions are sensed in a left/right asymmetric manner and that lateralized salt responses allow the worm to discriminate between distinct salt cues. To identify molecules that may be involved in sensing salt ions and/or transmitting such sensory information, we examined the chemotaxis behavior of animals harboring mutations in eight different receptor-type, transmembrane guanylyl cyclases (encoded by gcy genes), which are expressed in either ASEL (gcy-6, gcy-7, gcy-14), ASER (gcy-1, gcy-4, gcy-5, gcy-22), or ASEL and ASER (gcy-19). Disruption of a particular ASER-expressed gcy gene, gcy-22, results in a broad chemotaxis defect to nearly all salts sensed by ASER, as well as to a left/right asymmetrically sensed amino acid. In contrast, disruption of other gcy genes resulted in highly salt ion-specific chemosensory defects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings broaden our understanding of lateralities in neural function, provide insights into how this laterality is molecularly encoded, and reveal an unusual multitude of molecules involved in gustatory signal transduction."
18591666,1,Cell,413066,2009,BASL controls asymmetric cell division in Arabidopsis.,"Development in multicellular organisms requires the organized generation of differences. A universal mechanism for creating such differences is asymmetric cell division. In plants, as in animals, asymmetric divisions are correlated with the production of cellular diversity and pattern; however, structural constraints imposed by plant cell walls and the absence of homologs of known animal or fungal cell polarity regulators necessitates that plants utilize new molecules and mechanisms to create asymmetries. Here, we identify BASL, a novel regulator of asymmetric divisions in Arabidopsis. In asymmetrically dividing stomatal-lineage cells, BASL accumulates in a polarized crescent at the cell periphery before division, and then localizes differentially to the nucleus and a peripheral crescent in self-renewing cells and their sisters after division. BASL presence at the cell periphery is critical for its function, and we propose that BASL represents a plant-specific solution to the challenge of asymmetric cell division."
18596030,1,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,The role of decorated SDS micelles in sub-CMC protein denaturation and association.,"We have combined spectroscopy, chromatography, calorimetry, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to provide a comprehensive structural and stoichiometric description of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-induced denaturation of the 86-residue alpha-helical bovine acyl-coenzyme-A-binding protein (ACBP). Denaturation is a multistep process. Initial weak binding of 1-3 SDS molecules per protein molecule below 1.3 mM does not perturb the tertiary structure. Subsequent binding of approximately 13 SDS molecules per ACBP molecule leads to the formation of SDS aggregates on the protein and changes in both tertiary and secondary structures. SAXS data show that, at this stage, a decorated micelle links two ACBP molecules together, leaving about half of the polypeptide chain as a disordered region protruding into the solvent. Further titration with SDS leads to the additional uptake of 26 SDS molecules, which, according to SAXS, forms a larger decorated micelle bound to a single ACBP molecule. At the critical micelle concentration, we conclude from reduced mobility and increased fluorescence anisotropy that each ACBP molecule becomes associated with more than one micelle. At this point, 56-60 SDS molecules are bound per ACBP molecule. Our data provide key structural insights into decorated micelle complexes with proteins, revealing a remarkable diversity in the different conformations they can stabilize. The data highlight that a minimum decorated micelle size, which may be a key driving force for intermolecular protein association, exists. This may also provide a structural basis for the known ability of submicellar surfactant concentrations to induce protein aggregation and fibrillation."

18599299,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Improved results in proteomics by use of local and peptide-class specific false discovery rates.,"BACKGROUND: Proteomic protein identification results need to be compared across laboratories and platforms, and thus a reliable method is needed to estimate false discovery rates. The target-decoy strategy is a platform-independent and thus a prime candidate for standardized reporting of data. In its current usage based on global population parameters, the method does not utilize individual peptide scores optimally. RESULTS: Here we show that proteomic analyses largely benefit from using separate treatment of peptides matching to proteins alone or in groups based on locally estimated false discovery rates. Our implementation reduces the number of false positives and simultaneously increases the number of proteins identified. Importantly, single peptide identifications achieve defined confidence and the sequence coverage of proteins is optimized. As a result, we improve the number of proteins identified in a human serum analysis by 58% without compromising identification confidence. CONCLUSION: We show that proteins can reliably be identified with a single peptide and the sequence coverage for multi-peptide proteins can be increased when using an improved estimation of false discovery rates."

Familial studies on relatives of these patients indicated that they also appear to be at increased risk of cancer. METHODS: In a candidate gene study aiming at identifying genetic determinants of breast cancer susceptibility, we undertook the full sequencing of the NBN gene in our cohort of 97 high-risk non-BRCA1 and -BRCA2 breast cancer families, along with 74 healthy unrelated controls, also from the French Canadian population. In silico programs (ESEfinder, NNSplice, Splice Site Finder and MatInspector) were used to assess the putative impact of the variants identified. The effect of the promoter variant was further studied by luciferase gene reporter assay in MCF-7, HEK293, HeLa and LNCaP cell lines. RESULTS: Twenty-four variants were identified in our case series and their frequency was further evaluated in healthy controls. The potentially deleterious p.Ile171Val variant was observed in one case only. The p.Arg215Trp variant, suggested to impair NBN binding to histone gamma-H2AX, was observed in one breast cancer case and one healthy control. A promoter variant c.-242-110delAGTA displayed a significant variation in frequency between both sample sets. Luciferase reporter gene assay of the promoter construct bearing this variant did not suggest a variation of expression in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, but indicated a reduction of luciferase expression in both the HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of NBN sequence variations indicated that potential NBN alterations are present, albeit at a low frequency, in our cohort of high-risk breast cancer cases. Further analyses will be needed to fully ascertain the exact impact of those variants on breast cancer susceptibility, in particular for variants located in NBN promoter region."

GLUT8 carries a [D/E]XXXL[L/I]-type dileucine sorting signal that has been postulated to retain the protein in an endosomal/lysosomal compartment via interactions with clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. However, contradictory findings have been described regarding the subcellular localization of the endogenous GLUT8 and the adaptor proteins that interact with its dileucine motif. Here we demonstrate that endogenous GLUT8 is localized in a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of spermatocytes and spermatids, and that the adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2, but not AP3 or AP4, interact with its N-terminal intracellular domain (NICD). In addition, fusion of the GLUT8 NICD to the tailless lumenal domain of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (TAC) protein (interleukin-2 receptor a chain) targeted the protein to intracellular membranes, indicating that its N-terminal dileucine signal is sufficient for endosomal/lysosomal targeting of the transporter. The localization and targeting of GLUT8 show striking similarities to sorting mechanisms reported for lysosomal proteins. Therefore, we suggest a potential role for GLUT8 in the so far unexplored substrate transport across intracellular membranes."

J.,2984726R,2009,Modulation of the proteolytic activity of the complement protease C1s by polyanions: implications for polyanion-mediated acceleration of interaction between C1s and SERPING1.,"The complement system plays crucial roles in the immune system, but incorrect regulation causes inflammation and targeting of self-tissue, leading to diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and age-related macular degeneration. In vivo, the initiating complexes of the classical complement and lectin pathways are controlled by SERPING1 [(C1 inhibitor) serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade G, member 1], which inactivates the components C1s and MASP-2 (mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 2). GAGs (glycosaminoglycan) and DXS (dextran sulfate) are able to significantly accelerate SERPING1-mediated inactivation of C1s, the key effector enzyme of the classical C1 complex, although the mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study we have shown that C1s can bind to DXS and heparin and that these polyanions enhanced C1s proteolytic activity at low concentrations and inhibited it at higher concentrations. The recent determination of the crystal structure of SERPING1 has given rise to the hypothesis that both the serpin (serine protease inhibitor)-polyanion and protease-polyanion interactions might be required to accelerate the association rate of SERPING1 and C1s. To determine what proportion of the acceleration was due to protease-polyanion interactions, a chimaeric mutant of alpha1-antitrypsin containing the P4-P1 residues from the SERPING1 RCL (reactive-centre loop) was produced. Like SERPING1, this molecule is able to effectively inhibit C1s, but is unable to bind polyanions. DXS exerted a biphasic effect on the association rate of C1s which correlated strongly with the effect of DXS on C1s proteolytic activity. Thus, whereas polyanions are able to bind C1s and modulate its activity, polyanion interactions with SERPING1 must also play a vital role in the mechanism by which these cofactors accelerate the C1s-SERPING1 reaction."

Plant Microbe Interact.,9107902,2009,NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species production: subcellular localization and reassessment of its role in plant defense.,"Chemiluminescence detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered in tobacco BY-2 cells by the fungal elicitor cryptogein was previously demonstrated to be abolished in cells transformed with an antisense construct of the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase, NtrbohD. Here, using electron microscopy, it has been confirmed that the first hydrogen peroxide production occurring a few minutes after challenge of tobacco cells with cryptogein is plasma membrane located and NtrbohD mediated. Furthermore, the presence of NtrbohD in detergent-resistant membrane fractions could be associated with the presence of NtrbohD-mediated hydrogen peroxide patches along the plasma membrane. Comparison of the subcellular localization of ROS in wild-type tobacco and in plants transformed with antisense constructs of NtrbohD revealed that this enzyme is also responsible for the hydrogen peroxide production occurring at the plasma membrane after infiltration of tobacco leaves with cryptogein. Finally, the reactivity of wild-type and transformed plants to the elicitor and their resistance against the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora parasitica were examined. NtrbohD-mediated hydrogen peroxide production does not seem determinant for either hypersensitive response development or the establishment of acquired resistance but it is most likely involved in the signaling pathways associated with the protection of the plant cell."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Liquid-phase synthesis of block copolymers containing sequence-ordered segments.,"Monodisperse sequence-defined oligomers have been synthesized in solution in the absence of protecting groups. These structures have been prepared stepwise using two consecutive chemoselective reactions: 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal alkynes and azides and amidification of carboxylic acids with primary amines. These oligomers were efficiently constructed on either a conventional solid support (commercial Wang resin) or tailor-made soluble polystyrene supports synthesized by atom-transfer radical polymerization. The latter approach was found to be very versatile. Indeed, well-defined soluble macromolecular supports allowed not only the synthesis and cleavage of defined oligomers (i.e., sacrificial support) but also the preparation of noncleavable block copolymers containing sequence-defined segments."

Because many known disease biomarkers are both glycoproteins and membrane bound, we chose the hydrazide method to specifically target, enrich, and identify glycosylated proteins from breast cancer cell membrane fractions using the LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Our initial goal was to select membrane proteins from breast cancer cell lines and then to use the hydrazide method to identify the N-linked proteome as a prelude to evaluation of plasma/serum proteins from cancer patients. A combination of steps facilitated identification of the glycopeptides and also defined the glycosylation sites. In MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468 cell membrane fractions, use of the hydrazide method facilitated an initial enrichment and site mapping of 27 N-linked glycosylation sites in 25 different proteins. However, only three N-linked glycosylated proteins, galectin-3 binding protein, lysosome associated membrane glycoprotein 1, and oxygen regulated protein, were identified in all three breast cancer cell lines. In addition, MCF-7 cells shared an additional 3 proteins with MDA-MB-453. Interestingly, the hydrazide method isolated a number of other N-linked glycoproteins also known to be involved in breast cancer, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CD44, and the breast cancer 1, and early onset isoform 1 (BRCA1) biomarker. Analyzing the N-glycoproteins from membranes of breast cancer cell lines highlights the usefulness of the procedure for generating a practical set of potential biomarkers."

It is usually asymptomatic but approximately 4% are symptomatic with complications such as bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and inflammation. The authors report a case of a 7-year-old boy with a one-year history of recurrent periumbilical colicky pain with associated alimentary vomiting, symptoms erroneously related to a cyclic vomiting syndrome but not to MD.

METHODS: Expression of semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 in 48 samples of primary gastric carcinoma, its corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, and matched regional lymph node metastasis was assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: The protein and mRNA expression of semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 increased gradually in non-neoplastic mucosa, primary gastric carcinoma and lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the expression of semaphorin 5A was closely correlated with that of plexin B3. CONCLUSION: Semaphorin 5A and its receptor plexin B3 play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of gastric carcinoma."
18611375,1,World J.

METHODS: From January to December 2007, patients with chronic hepatitis C or compensated liver cirrhosis with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (43-80 years old) showing positive serum HCV-RNA who had already taken 600 mg/d of UDCA were recruited into this study. Blood parameters were examined at 4, 8 and 24 wk after increasing the dose of oral UDCA from 600 to 900 mg/d. RESULTS: Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels were significantly decreased following the administration of 900 mg/d as compared to 600 mg/d. The decrease in ALT from immediately before the dose-up of UDCA to 8 wk after the dose-up was 14.3 IU/L, while that for AST was 10.5 IU/L and for GGT was 9.8 IU/L. Platelet count tended to increase after the dose-up of UDCA, although it did not show a statistically significant level (P = 0.05). Minor adverse events were observed in 3 cases, although no drop-outs from the study occurred. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of 900 mg/d of UDCA was more effective than 600 mg/d for reducing ALT, AST, and GGT levels in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease."
18611377,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Predictive value of multi-detector computed tomography for accurate diagnosis of serous cystadenoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"AIM: To identify multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) features most predictive of serous cystadenomas (SCAs), correlating with histopathology, and to study the impact of cyst size and MDCT technique on reader performance. METHODS: The MDCT scans of 164 patients with surgically verified pancreatic cystic lesions were reviewed by two readers to study the predictive value of various morphological features for establishing a diagnosis of SCAs. Accuracy in lesion characterization and reader confidence were correlated with lesion size (&lt;or= 3 cm or &gt;or= 3 cm) and scanning protocols (dedicated vs routine). RESULTS: 28/164 cysts (mean size, 39 mm; range, 8-92 mm) were diagnosed as SCA on pathology. The MDCT features predictive of diagnosis of SCA were microcystic appearance (22/28, 78.6%), surface lobulations (25/28, 89.3%) and central scar (9/28, 32.4%). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that only microcystic appearance was significant for CT diagnosis of SCA (P = 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity and PPV of central scar and of combined microcystic appearance and lobulations were 32.4%/100%/100% and 68%/100%/100%, respectively. The reader confidence was higher for lesions &gt; 3 cm (P = 0.02) and for MDCT scans performed using thin collimation (1.25-2.5 mm) compared to routine 5 mm collimation exams (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Central scar on MDCT is diagnostic of SCA but is seen in only one third of SCAs. Microcystic morphology is the most significant CT feature in diagnosis of SCA. A combination of microcystic appearance and surface lobulations offers accuracy comparable to central scar with higher sensitivity."
18611379,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Active dendrites enhance neuronal dynamic range.,"Since the first experimental evidences of active conductances in dendrites, most neurons have been shown to exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of a variety of voltage-gated ion channels. However, despite experimental and theoretical efforts undertaken in the past decades, the role of this excitability for some kind of dendritic computation has remained elusive. Here we show that, owing to very general properties of excitable media, the average output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, attaining extremely large dynamic ranges (above 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response functions as experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We claim that enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic range and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range."

This paper presents a heuristic algorithm for discovering the Most Likely Functional Counterparts (MoLFunCs) of a protein, based on simple concepts from network theory. A key feature of our algorithm is utilization of the user's knowledge to assign high confidence to selected functional identification. We show use of the algorithm to retrieve functional equivalents for 7 membrane proteins, from an exploration of almost 40 genomes form multiple online resources. We verify the functional equivalency of our dataset through a series of tests that include sequence, structure and function comparisons. Comparison is made to the OMA methodology, which also identifies one-on-one mapping between proteins from different species. Based on that comparison, we believe that incorporation of user's knowledge as a key aspect of the technique adds value to purely statistical formal methods."
18611383,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,SLC30A3 (ZnT3) oligomerization by dityrosine bonds regulates its subcellular localization and metal transport capacity.,"Non-covalent and covalent homo-oligomerization of membrane proteins regulates their subcellular localization and function. Here, we described a novel oligomerization mechanism affecting solute carrier family 30 member 3/zinc transporter 3 (SLC30A3/ZnT3). Oligomerization was mediated by intermolecular covalent dityrosine bonds. Using mutagenized ZnT3 expressed in PC12 cells, we identified two critical tyrosine residues necessary for dityrosine-mediated ZnT3 oligomerization. ZnT3 carrying the Y372F mutation prevented ZnT3 oligomerization, decreased ZnT3 targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), and decreased resistance to zinc toxicity. Strikingly, ZnT3 harboring the Y357F mutation behaved as a &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutant as it displayed increased ZnT3 oligomerization, targeting to SLMVs, and increased resistance to zinc toxicity. Single and double tyrosine ZnT3 mutants indicate that the predominant dimeric species is formed between tyrosine 357 and 372. ZnT3 tyrosine dimerization was detected under normal conditions and it was enhanced by oxidative stress. Covalent species were also detected in other SLC30A zinc transporters localized in different subcellular compartments. These results indicate that covalent tyrosine dimerization of a SLC30A family member modulates its subcellular localization and zinc transport capacity. We propose that dityrosine-dependent membrane protein oligomerization may regulate the function of diverse membrane protein in normal and disease states."
18612383,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Chikungunya virus and Aedes mosquitoes: saliva is infectious as soon as two days after oral infection.,"BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are potential vectors of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The recent CHIKV outbreaks were caused by a new variant characterized by a mutation in the E1 glycoprotein gene (E1-226V) which has favored a better transmissibility by Ae. albopictus. As Ae. albopictus tends to replace Ae. aegypti in many regions, one question remained: is Ae. albopictus as efficient as Ae. aegypti to transmit the variant E1-226V of CHIKV? METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: We infected orally both species with the variant E1-226V and estimated the infection, the viral dissemination, and the transmission rate by real time RT-PCR. Additionally, we used an in vitro assay to determine the amount of virus delivered by mosquitoes in their saliva. We found that Ae. aegypti as well as Ae. albopictus ensured a high replication of the virus which underwent an efficient dissemination as detectable in the salivary glands at day 2 post-infection (pi). Infectious CHIKV particles were delivered by salivary glands from day 2 with a maximum at day 6 pi for Ae. albopictus (10(3.3) PFU) and day 7 pi for Ae. aegypti (10(2.5) PFU). CONCLUSIONS: Ae. albopictus is slightly more efficient than Ae. aegypti to transmit the variant E1-226V of CHIKV. These results will help to design an efficient vector control to limit transmission as soon as the first human cases are diagnosed."
18613748,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"Endurance capacity, not body size, determines physical activity levels: role of skeletal muscle PEPCK.","Some people remain lean despite pressure to gain weight. Lean people tend to have high daily activity levels, but the source of this increased activity is unknown. We found that leanness cannot be accounted for by increased weight-corrected food intake in two different types of lean rats. As previously reported in lean people, we found that lean rats had higher daily activity levels; lean rats also expended more energy. These lean rats were developed through artificial selection for high aerobic endurance capacity. To test whether our findings extended to a human population, we measured endurance capacity using a VO(2max) treadmill test and daily activity in a group of non-exercising individuals. Similar to lean rats selectively bred for endurance capacity, our study revealed that people with higher VO(2max) also spent more time active throughout the day. Hence, endurance capacity may be the trait that underlies both physical activity levels and leanness. We identified one potential mechanism for the lean, active phenotype in rats, namely high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK. Therefore, the lean phenotype is characterized by high endurance capacity and high activity and may stem from altered skeletal muscle energetics."
18614016,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Rapid pathogen-induced apoptosis: a mechanism used by dendritic cells to limit intracellular replication of Legionella pneumophila.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized phagocytes that internalize exogenous antigens and microbes at peripheral sites, and then migrate to lymphatic organs to display foreign peptides to naïve T cells. There are several examples where DCs have been shown to be more efficient at restricting the intracellular replication of pathogens compared to macrophages, a property that could prevent DCs from enhancing pathogen dissemination. To understand DC responses to pathogens, we investigated the mechanisms by which mouse DCs are able to restrict replication of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. We show that both DCs and macrophages have the ability to interfere with L. pneumophila replication through a cell death pathway mediated by caspase-1 and Naip5. L. pneumophila that avoided Naip5-dependent responses, however, showed robust replication in macrophages but remained unable to replicate in DCs. Apoptotic cell death mediated by caspase-3 was found to occur much earlier in DCs following infection by L. pneumophila compared to macrophages infected similarly. Eliminating the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak or overproducing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were both found to restore L. pneumophila replication in DCs. Thus, DCs have a microbial response pathway that rapidly activates apoptosis to limit pathogen replication."
18614018,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,Copy number variation in intron 1 of SOX5 causes the Pea-comb phenotype in chickens.,"Pea-comb is a dominant mutation in chickens that drastically reduces the size of the comb and wattles. It is an adaptive trait in cold climates as it reduces heat loss and makes the chicken less susceptible to frost lesions. Here we report that Pea-comb is caused by a massive amplification of a duplicated sequence located near evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences in intron 1 of the gene encoding the SOX5 transcription factor. This must be the causative mutation since all other polymorphisms associated with the Pea-comb allele were excluded by genetic analysis. SOX5 controls cell fate and differentiation and is essential for skeletal development, chondrocyte differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Immunostaining in early embryos demonstrated that Pea-comb is associated with ectopic expression of SOX5 in mesenchymal cells located just beneath the surface ectoderm where the comb and wattles will subsequently develop. The results imply that the duplication expansion interferes with the regulation of SOX5 expression during the differentiation of cells crucial for the development of comb and wattles. The study provides novel insight into the nature of mutations that contribute to phenotypic evolution and is the first description of a spontaneous and fully viable mutation in this developmentally important gene."
18615096,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Intracellular domains interactions and gated motions of I(KS) potassium channel subunits.,"Voltage-gated K(+) channels co-assemble with auxiliary beta subunits to form macromolecular complexes. In heart, assembly of Kv7.1 pore-forming subunits with KCNE1 beta subunits generates the repolarizing K(+) current I(KS). However, the detailed nature of their interface remains unknown. Mutations in either Kv7.1 or KCNE1 produce the life-threatening long or short QT syndromes. Here, we studied the interactions and voltage-dependent motions of I(KS) channel intracellular domains, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer combined with voltage-clamp recording and in vitro binding of purified proteins. The results indicate that the KCNE1 distal C-terminus interacts with the coiled-coil helix C of the Kv7.1 tetramerization domain. This association is important for I(KS) channel assembly rules as underscored by Kv7.1 current inhibition produced by a dominant-negative C-terminal domain. On channel opening, the C-termini of Kv7.1 and KCNE1 come close together. Co-expression of Kv7.1 with the KCNE1 long QT mutant D76N abolished the K(+) currents and gated motions. Thus, during channel gating KCNE1 is not static. Instead, the C-termini of both subunits experience molecular motions, which are disrupted by the D76N causing disease mutation."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Acetylation of histone H3 at the nucleosome dyad alters DNA-histone binding.,"Histone post-translational modifications are essential for regulating and facilitating biological processes such as RNA transcription and DNA repair. Fifteen modifications are located in the DNA-histone dyad interface and include the acetylation of H3-K115 (H3-K115Ac) and H3-K122 (H3-K122Ac), but the functional consequences of these modifications are unknown. We have prepared semisynthetic histone H3 acetylated at Lys-115 and/or Lys-122 by expressed protein ligation and incorporated them into single nucleosomes. Competitive reconstitution analysis demonstrated that the acetylation of H3-K115 and H3-K122 reduces the free energy of histone octamer binding. Restriction enzyme kinetic analysis suggests that these histone modifications do not alter DNA accessibility near the sites of modification. However, acetylation of H3-K122 increases the rate of thermal repositioning. Remarkably, Lys --&gt; Gln substitution mutations, which are used to mimic Lys acetylation, do not fully duplicate the effects of the H3-K115Ac or H3-K122Ac modifications. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that acetylation in the dyad interface reduces DNA-histone interaction(s), which may facilitate nucleosome repositioning and/or assembly/disassembly."
18617507,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Differential effect of membrane cholesterol removal on mu- and delta-opioid receptors: a parallel comparison of acute and chronic signaling to adenylyl cyclase.,"According to the lipid raft theory, the plasma membrane contains small domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipid, which may serve as platforms to organize membrane proteins. Using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) to deplete membrane cholesterol, many G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to depend on putative lipid rafts for proper signaling. Here we examine the hypothesis that treatment of HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged mu-opioid receptors (HEK FLAG-mu) or delta-opioid receptors (HEK FLAG-delta) with MbetaCD will reduce opioid receptor signaling to adenylyl cyclase. The ability of the mu-opioid agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin to acutely inhibit adenylyl cyclase or to cause sensitization of adenylyl cyclase following chronic treatment was attenuated with MbetaCD. These effects were due to removal of cholesterol, because replenishment of cholesterol restored [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin responses back to control values, and were confirmed in SH-SY5Y cells endogenously expressing mu-opioid receptors. The effects of MbetaCD may be due to uncoupling of the mu receptor from G proteins but were not because of decreases in receptor number and were not mimicked by cytoskeleton disruption. In contrast to the results in HEK FLAG-mu cells, MbetaCD treatment of HEK FLAG-delta cells had no effect on acute inhibition or sensitization of adenylyl cyclase by delta-opioid agonists. The differential responses of mu- and delta-opioid agonists to cholesterol depletion suggest that mu-opioid receptors are more dependent on cholesterol for efficient signaling than delta receptors and can be partly explained by localization of mu- but not delta-opioid receptors in cholesterol- and caveolin-enriched membrane domains."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Degradation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein precursor requires the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation components Ubc7 and Hrd1 in fission yeast.,"Sre1, the fission yeast sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound transcription factor that is a principal regulator of hypoxic gene expression. Under low oxygen, Sre1 is cleaved from its inactive ER precursor form to generate an active nuclear transcription factor that up-regulates genes required for low oxygen growth. To maintain a constant supply of Sre1, Sre1 precursor synthesis must be regulated to replenish Sre1 precursor lost to proteolytic cleavage under low oxygen. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms controlling Sre1 precursor levels. We found that positive feedback regulation at the sre1(+) promoter increases the synthesis of the Sre1 precursor under low oxygen and that this regulation is required for maximal Sre1 activation and target gene expression. We also demonstrate that the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in the absence of its binding partner Scp1, which is required for oxygen-regulated Sre1 cleavage. Degradation of Sre1 in the absence of Scp1 requires the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components Ubc7, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and Hrd1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We conclude that positive feedback regulation to up-regulate Sre1 precursor synthesis under low oxygen is essential for Sre1 function and propose that excess Sre1 precursor is removed by ERAD to ensure complex formation between Sre1 and its binding partner Scp1. Thus, Sre1 is a new example of an endogenous ERAD substrate, establishing fission yeast as an organism for the study of this important degradative pathway."
18621684,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Role of pICLn in methylation of Sm proteins by PRMT5.,"pICln is an essential, highly conserved 26-kDa protein whose functions include binding to Sm proteins in the cytoplasm of human cells and mediating the ordered and regulated assembly of the cell's RNA-splicing machinery by the survival motor neurons complex. pICln also interacts with PRMT5, the enzyme responsible for generating symmetric dimethylarginine modifications on the carboxyl-terminal regions of three of the canonical Sm proteins. To better understand the role of pICln in these cellular processes, we have investigated the properties of pICln and pICln.Sm complexes and the effects that pICln has on the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5. We find that pICln is a monomer in solution, binds with high affinity (K(d) approximately 160 nm) to SmD3-SmB, and forms 1:1 complexes with Sm proteins and Sm protein subcomplexes. The data support an end-capping model of pICln binding that supports current views of how pICln prevents Sm oligomerization on illicit RNA substrates. We have found that by co-expression with pICln, recombinant PRMT5 can be produced in a soluble, active form. PRMT5 alone has promiscuous activity toward a variety of known substrates. In the presence of pICln, however, PRMT5 methylation of Sm proteins is stimulated, but methylation of histones is inhibited. We have also found that mutations in pICln that do not affect Sm protein binding can still have a profound effect on the methyltransferase activity of the PRMT5 complex. Together, the data provide insights into pICln function and represent an important starting point for biochemical analyses of PRMT5."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Adiponectin activates AMP-activated protein kinase in muscle cells via APPL1/LKB1-dependent and phospholipase C/Ca2+/Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-dependent pathways.,"The binding of the adaptor protein APPL1 to adiponectin receptors is necessary for adiponectin-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in muscle, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that in muscle cells adiponectin and metformin induce AMPK activation by promoting APPL1-dependent LKB1 cytosolic translocation. APPL1 mediates adiponectin signaling by directly interacting with adiponectin receptors and enhances LKB1 cytosolic localization by anchoring this kinase in the cytosol. Adiponectin also activates another AMPK upstream kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase by activating phospholipase C and subsequently inducing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays a minor role in AMPK activation. Our results show that in muscle cells adiponectin is able to activate AMPK via two distinct mechanisms as follows: a major pathway (the APPL1/LKB1-dependent pathway) that promotes the cytosolic localization of LKB1 and a minor pathway (the phospholipase C/Ca2+/Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-dependent pathway) that stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K represses the production of pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS splice isoform.,"The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(S) isoforms. By performing deletion mutagenesis on a human Bcl-x minigene, we have identified a novel exonic element that controls the use of the 5' splice site of Bcl-x(S). The proximal portion of this element acts as a repressor and is located downstream of an enhancer. Further mutational analysis provided a detailed topological map of the regulatory activities revealing a sharp transition between enhancer and repressor sequences. Portions of the enhancer can function when transplanted in another alternative splicing unit. Chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the silencer element interacts with heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) K, consistent with the presence of putative high affinity sites for this protein. Finally, down-regulation of hnRNP K by RNA interference enhanced splicing to Bcl-x(S), an effect seen only when the sequences bound by hnRNP K are present. Our results therefore document a clear role for hnRNP K in preventing the production of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(S) splice isoform."

Immunol.,7905289,2009,Characterization of rabbit CD5 isoforms.,"Previously described polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rabbit CD5, raised against expressed recombinant protein or peptides, recognize CD5 on most rabbit B cells. The mAb KEN-5 was originally reported to recognize rabbit CD5. However, KEN-5 binds almost exclusively to T cells and only to a minor population of B cells. We show here that by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), KEN-5 binds to recombinant rabbit CD5. This interaction is partially inhibited by polyclonal goat anti-CD5 antibody. In addition, immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated rabbit lymphocytes with KEN-5 or our anti-CD5 mAb isolate molecules that migrate identically on gels with the same approximate relative molecular mass of 67,000 M(r). By flow cytometric analyses of individual cells from spleen, thymus and appendix, KEN-5 recognizes CD5-like molecules mainly on T cells and on 3-6% of IgM(+) B cells. Immunohistochemical staining of splenic and appendix tissues and confocal immunofluorescent imaging confirm and extend results from flow cytometric analyses. Quantitation of fluorescent colocalization indicates that staining by KEN-5 colocalizes with staining by anti-CD5 on small percentage lymphocytes in splenic tissue sections. As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells. This hypothesis is supported by ELISA data that show that deglycosylation diminishes the binding of KEN-5 to recombinant rabbit CD5. Screening KEN-5 on an array with 406 glycans was inconclusive. Although we did not identify a strongly binding glycan structure, the data are suggestive that the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be influenced by glycan structures. The epitope this mAb recognizes may either be the glycan itself, or more likely, is influenced by neighboring glycan structure. Our findings suggest that development, selection and function of different B- and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells."
18636086,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Characterization and expression analysis of type I interferon in common carp Cyprinus carpio L.,"The type I interferon (I-IFN) gene has recently been cloned and sequenced in the common carp species Cyprinus carpio L. Carp I-IFN cDNA is composed of 675 base pairs and is translated into a protein of 186 amino acid residues. The carp I-IFN encodes a predicted signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues and contains the I-IFN family signature His(140)-Trp(158). Analysis of the homology between carp I-IFN and other known I-IFN and type II interferon (II-IFN) family members has revealed significant similarities to grass carp I-IFN. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that carp I-IFN clusters with I-IFN in teleosts, away from the other II-IFN family members. In addition, the gene structure for carp I-IFN is composed of 5 exons and 4 introns, a composition that is similar to that of the teleost I-IFN gene. RT-PCR analysis did not reveal gene expression in un-stimulated tissues including intestine, liver, gill, head kidney, muscle, spleen, mid-kidney and skin. However, I-IFN expression levels increased following stimulation with imiquimod in the head kidney cells. Furthermore, recombinant carp I-IFN protein (mature form) produced via the cell-free protein synthesis system stimulated the expression of the interferon-inducible Mx gene in the head kidney cells."
18636090,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2 functions as a Ca2+-dependent adaptor that bridges Alix and TSG101.,"Alix and TSG101, known to physically interact with each other, have Pro-rich regions that are bound by ALG-2 Ca2+-dependently. We investigated the role of ALG-2 in the Alix-TSG101 association by pulldown assays using Strep-tagged Alix and its various mutants. The ALG-2-binding site was required for the Ca2+-dependent pulldown of TSG101 using HEK293T cells, whereas the PSAP sequence, a binding motif for the UEV domain of TSG101, was dispensable. Alix-TSG101 association was not observed using ALG-2-knockdown cells but became detectable by addition of the purified recombinant ALG-2 protein in the assay mixtures. Exogenous expression of mGFP-fused ALG-2 also restored the pulldown capability of Strep-Alix, but an alternatively spliced shorter ALG-2 isoform and a dimerization-defective mutant were incompetent. Based on the X-ray crystal structure model showing the presence of one ligand-binding site in each molecule of an ALG-2 dimer, we propose that Ca2+-loaded ALG-2 bridges Alix and TSG101 as an adaptor protein."
18636095,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Activation of dopamine D1 receptors blocks phencyclidine-induced neurotoxicity by enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic strength.,"Early postnatal blockade of NMDA receptors by phencyclidine (PCP) causes cortical apoptosis in animals. This is associated with the development of schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats later in life. Recent studies show that the mechanism involves a loss of neurotrophic support from the phosphoinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway, which is normally maintained by synaptic NMDA receptor activation. Here we report that activation of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) with dihydrexidine (DHX) prevents PCP-induced neurotoxicity in cortical neurons by enhancing the efficacy of NMDAergic synapses. DHX increases serine phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit through protein kinase A activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit via Src kinase. DHX enhances recruitment of NR1 and NR2B, but not NR2A, into synapses. DHX also facilitated the synaptic response in cortical slices and this was blocked by an NR2B antagonist. DHX pre-treatment of rat pups prior to PCP on postnatal days 7, 9 and 11 inhibited PCP-induced caspase-3 activation on PN11 and deficits in pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle measured on PN 26-28. In summary, these data demonstrate that PCP-induced deficits in NMDA receptor function, neurotoxicity and subsequent behavioral deficits may be prevented by D1R activation in the cortex and further, it is suggested that D1R activation may be beneficial in treating schizophrenia."
18641123,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Differential pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors in axon terminals and soma of dentate gyrus granule cells.,"Although it has been well established that GABA(A) receptors are molecular targets of a variety of allosteric modulators, such as benzodiazepines, the pharmacological properties of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors are poorly understood. In this study, the effects of diazepam and Zn(2+) on presynaptic GABA(A) receptors have been investigated by measuring the GABA(A) receptor-mediated facilitation of spontaneous glutamate release in mechanically dissociated rat CA3 pyramidal neurons. Diazepam significantly enhanced the muscimol-induced facilitation (particularly at submicromolar concentrations) of spontaneous glutamate release and shifted the concentration-response relationship for muscimol toward the left, whereas Zn(2+) (&lt;OR= 100 muM) had little effect on the muscimol-induced facilitation of spontaneous glutamate release. In contrast, Zn(2+) significantly suppressed the muscimol-induced currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors expressed on dentate gyrus granule cells, which are parent neurons of mossy fibers, whereas the effect of diazepam on GABA(A) receptors expressed on dentate gyrus granule cells was lesser than that on presynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The results suggest that the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors differ considerably between presynaptic (axon terminals) and somatic regions in the same granule cell and that presynaptic GABA(A) receptors should be considered as one of the important pharmacological targets of many drugs affecting GABA(A) receptors."
18641128,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,mu-opioid receptor-stimulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species is mediated via phospholipase D2.,"We have recently shown that the activation of the rat mu-opioid receptor (MOPr, also termed MOR1) by the mu-agonist [D-Ala(2), Me Phe(4), Glyol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO) leads to an increase in phospholipase D2 (PLD2) activity and an induction of receptor endocytosis, whereas the agonist morphine which does not induce opioid receptor endocytosis fails to activate PLD2. We report here that MOPr-mediated activation of PLD2 stimulates production of reactive oxygen molecules via NADH/NADPH oxidase. Oxidative stress was measured with the fluorescent probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and the role of PLD2 was assessed by the PLD inhibitor D-erythro-sphingosine (sphinganine) and by PLD2-small interfering RNA transfection. To determine whether NADH/NADPH oxidase contributes to opioid-induced production of reactive oxygen species, mu-agonist-stimulated cells were pre-treated with the flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, or the specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin. Our results demonstrate that receptor-internalizing agonists (like DAMGO, beta-endorphin, methadone, piritramide, fentanyl, sufentanil, and etonitazene) strongly induce NADH/NADPH-mediated ROS synthesis via PLD-dependent signaling pathways, whereas agonists that do not induce MOPr endocytosis and PLD2 activation (like morphine, buprenorphine, hydromorphone, and oxycodone) failed to activate ROS synthesis in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These findings indicate that the agonist-selective PLD2 activation plays a key role in the regulation of NADH/NADPH-mediated ROS formation by opioids."
18644794,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,"Nonadditivity in the recognition of single-stranded DNA by the schizosaccharomyces pombe protection of telomeres 1 DNA-binding domain, Pot1-DBD.","The Schizosaccharomyces pombe protection of telomeres 1 (SpPot1) protein recognizes the 3' single-stranded ends of telomeres and provides essential protective and regulatory functions. The ssDNA-binding activity of SpPot1 is conferred by its ssDNA-binding domain, Pot1-DBD (residues 1-389), which can be further separated into two distinct domains, Pot1pN (residues 1-187) and Pot1pC (residues 188-389). Here we show that Pot1pC, like Pot1pN, can function independently of Pot1-DBD and binds specifically to a minimal nonameric oligonucleotide, d(GGTTACGGT), with a K(D) of 400 +/- 70 nM (specifically recognized nucleotides in bold). NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis indicates that the overall structures of the isolated Pot1pN and Pot1pC domains remain intact in Pot1-DBD. Furthermore, alanine scanning reveals modest differences in the ssDNA-binding contacts provided by isolated Pot1pN and within Pot1-DBD. Although the global character of both Pot1pN and Pot1pC is maintained in Pot1-DBD, chemical shift perturbation analysis highlights localized structural differences within the G1/G2 and T3/T4 binding pockets of Pot1pN in Pot1-DBD, which correlate with its distinct ssDNA-binding activity. Furthermore, we find evidence for a putative interdomain interface on Pot1pN that mediates interactions with Pot1pC that ultimately result in the altered ssDNA-binding activity of Pot1-DBD. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the activity and regulation of SpPot1 at the telomere."
18647830,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Human fear conditioning and extinction in neuroimaging: a systematic review.,"Fear conditioning and extinction are basic forms of associative learning that have gained considerable clinical relevance in enhancing our understanding of anxiety disorders and facilitating their treatment. Modern neuroimaging techniques have significantly aided the identification of anatomical structures and networks involved in fear conditioning. On closer inspection, there is considerable variation in methodology and results between studies. This systematic review provides an overview of the current neuroimaging literature on fear conditioning and extinction on healthy subjects, taking into account methodological issues such as the conditioning paradigm. A Pubmed search, as of December 2008, was performed and supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Two independent reviewers made the final study selection and data extraction. A total of 46 studies on cued fear conditioning and/or extinction on healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. The influence of specific experimental factors, such as contingency and timing parameters, assessment of conditioned responses, and characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, on cerebral activation patterns was examined. Results were summarized descriptively. A network consisting of fear-related brain areas, such as amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, is activated independently of design parameters. However, some neuroimaging studies do not report these findings in the presence of methodological heterogeneities. Furthermore, other brain areas are differentially activated, depending on specific design parameters. These include stronger hippocampal activation in trace conditioning and tactile stimulation. Furthermore, tactile unconditioned stimuli enhance activation of pain related, motor, and somatosensory areas. Differences concerning experimental factors may partly explain the variance between neuroimaging investigations on human fear conditioning and extinction and should, therefore, be taken into serious consideration in the planning and the interpretation of research projects."
18647839,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,The QKI-6 and QKI-7 RNA binding proteins block proliferation and promote Schwann cell myelination.,"BACKGROUND: The quaking viable (qk(v)) mice have uncompacted myelin in their central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS). The qk gene encodes 3 major alternatively spliced isoforms that contain unique sequence at their C-terminus dictating their cellular localization. QKI-5 is a nuclear isoform, whereas QKI-6 and QKI-7 are cytoplasmic isoforms. The qk(v) mice harbor an enhancer/promoter deletion that prevents the expression of isoforms QKI-6 and QKI-7 in myelinating cells resulting in a dysmyelination phenotype. It was shown that QKI regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, however, little is known about the role of the QKI proteins, or RNA binding proteins in PNS myelination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To define the role of the QKI proteins in PNS myelination, we ectopically expressed QKI-6 and QKI-7 in primary rat Schwann cell/neuron from dorsal root ganglia cocultures. We show that the QKI isoforms blocked proliferation and promoted Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. In addition, these events were coordinated with elevated proteins levels of p27(KIP1) and myelin basic protein (MBP), markers of Schwann cell differentiation. QKI-6 and QKI-7 expressing co-cultures contained myelinated fibers that had directionality and contained significantly thicker myelin, as assessed by electron microscopy. Moreover, QKI-deficient Schwann cells had reduced levels of MBP, p27(KIP1) and Krox-20 mRNAs, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the QKI-6 and QKI-7 RNA binding proteins are positive regulators of PNS myelination and show that the QKI RNA binding proteins play a key role in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination."
18650379,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Analysis of host-mediated repair mechanisms after human CNS-stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury: correlation of engraftment with recovery.,"BACKGROUND: Human central nervous system-stem cells grown as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) self-renew, are multipotent, and have potential therapeutic applications following trauma to the spinal cord. We have previously shown locomotor recovery in immunodeficient mice that received a moderate contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) and hCNS-SCns transplantation 9 days post-injury (dpi). Engrafted hCNS-SCns exhibited terminal differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes and synapse-forming neurons. Further, selective ablation of human cells using Diphtheria toxin (DT) abolished locomotor recovery in this paradigm, suggesting integration of human cells within the mouse host as a possible mechanism for the locomotor improvement. However, the hypothesis that hCNS-SCns could alter the host microenvironment as an additional or alternative mechanism of recovery remained unexplored; we tested that hypothesis in the present study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Stereological quantification of human cells using a human-specific cytoplasmic marker demonstrated successful cell engraftment, survival, migration and limited proliferation in all hCNS-SCns transplanted animals. DT administration at 16 weeks post-transplant ablated 80.5% of hCNS-SCns. Stereological quantification for lesion volume, tissue sparing, descending serotonergic host fiber sprouting, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposition, glial scarring, and angiogenesis demonstrated no evidence of host modification within the mouse spinal cord as a result of hCNS-SCns transplantation. Biochemical analyses supplemented stereological data supporting the absence of neural stem-cell mediated host repair. However, linear regression analysis of the number of engrafted hCNS-SCns vs. the number of errors on a horizontal ladder beam task revealed a strong correlation between these variables (r = -0.78, p&lt;0.05), suggesting that survival and engraftment were directly related to a quantitative measure of recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the data suggest that the locomotor improvements associated with hCNS-SCns transplantation were not due to modifications within the host microenvironment, supporting the hypothesis that human cell integration within the host circuitry mediates functional recovery following a 9 day delayed transplant."
18653891,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Novel genotypes of H9N2 influenza A viruses isolated from poultry in Pakistan containing NS genes similar to highly pathogenic H7N3 and H5N1 viruses.,"The impact of avian influenza caused by H9N2 viruses in Pakistan is now significantly more severe than in previous years. Since all gene segments contribute towards the virulence of avian influenza virus, it was imperative to investigate the molecular features and genetic relationships of H9N2 viruses prevalent in this region. Analysis of the gene sequences of all eight RNA segments from 12 viruses isolated between 2005 and 2008 was undertaken. The hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of all isolates were closely related to H9N2 viruses isolated from Iran between 2004 and 2007 and contained leucine instead of glutamine at position 226 in the receptor binding pocket, a recognised marker for the recognition of sialic acids linked alpha2-6 to galactose. The neuraminidase (NA) of two isolates contained a unique five residue deletion in the stalk (from residues 80 to 84), a possible indication of greater adaptation of these viruses to the chicken host. The HA, NA, nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) genes showed close identity with H9N2 viruses isolated during 1999 in Pakistan and clustered in the A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 virus lineage. In contrast, the polymerase genes clustered with H9N2 viruses from India, Iran and Dubai. The NS gene segment showed greater genetic diversity and shared a high level of similarity with NS genes from either H5 or H7 subtypes rather than with established H9N2 Eurasian lineages. These results indicate that during recent years the H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive genetic reassortment which has led to the generation of H9N2 viruses of novel genotypes in the Indian sub-continent. The novel genotypes of H9N2 viruses may play a role in the increased problems observed by H9N2 to poultry and reinforce the continued need to monitor H9N2 infections for their zoonotic potential."
18660751,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Meiosis drives extraordinary genome plasticity in the haploid fungal plant pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola.,"Meiosis in the haploid plant-pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola results in eight ascospores due to a mitotic division following the two meiotic divisions. The transient diploid phase allows for recombination among homologous chromosomes. However, some chromosomes of M. graminicola lack homologs and do not pair during meiosis. Because these chromosomes are not present universally in the genome of the organism they can be considered to be dispensable. To analyze the meiotic transmission of unequal chromosome numbers, two segregating populations were generated by crossing genetically unrelated parent isolates originating from Algeria and The Netherlands that had pathogenicity towards durum or bread wheat, respectively. Detailed genetic analyses of these progenies using high-density mapping (1793 DArT, 258 AFLP and 25 SSR markers) and graphical genotyping revealed that M. graminicola has up to eight dispensable chromosomes, the highest number reported in filamentous fungi. These chromosomes vary from 0.39 to 0.77 Mb in size, and represent up to 38% of the chromosomal complement. Chromosome numbers among progeny isolates varied widely, with some progeny missing up to three chromosomes, while other strains were disomic for one or more chromosomes. Between 15-20% of the progeny isolates lacked one or more chromosomes that were present in both parents. The two high-density maps showed no recombination of dispensable chromosomes and hence, their meiotic processing may require distributive disjunction, a phenomenon that is rarely observed in fungi. The maps also enabled the identification of individual twin isolates from a single ascus that shared the same missing or doubled chromosomes indicating that the chromosomal polymorphisms were mitotically stable and originated from nondisjunction during the second division and, less frequently, during the first division of fungal meiosis. High genome plasticity could be among the strategies enabling this versatile pathogen to quickly overcome adverse biotic and abiotic conditions in wheat fields."
18660752,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Cryptic subtelomeric rearrangements and X chromosome mosaicism: a study of 565 apparently normal individuals with fluorescent in situ hybridization.,"Five percent of patients with unexplained mental retardation have been attributed to cryptic unbalanced subtelomeric rearrangements. Half of these affected individuals have inherited the rearrangement from a parent who is a carrier for a balanced translocation. However, the frequency of carriers for cryptic balanced translocations is unknown. To determine this frequency, 565 phenotypically normal unrelated individuals were examined for balanced subtelomeric rearrangements using Fluorescent In Situ hybridization (FISH) probes for all subtelomere regions. While no balanced subtelomeric rearrangements were identified, three females in this study were determined to be mosaic for the X chromosome. Mosaicism for XXX cell lines were observed in the lymphocyte cultures of 3 in 379 women (0.8%), which is a higher frequency than the 1 in 1000 (0.1%) reported for sex chromosome aneuploidies. Our findings suggest that numerical abnormalities of the X chromosome are more common in females than previously reported. Based on a review of the literature, the incidence of cryptic translocation carriers is estimated to be approximately 1/8,000, more than ten-fold higher than the frequency of visible reciprocal translocations."
18660753,1,Nature,410462,2009,Flipping of alkylated DNA damage bridges base and nucleotide excision repair.,"Alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs) share functional motifs with the cancer chemotherapy target O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and paradoxically protect cells from the biological effects of DNA alkylation damage, despite lacking the reactive cysteine and alkyltransferase activity of AGT. Here we determine Schizosaccharomyces pombe ATL structures without and with damaged DNA containing the endogenous lesion O(6)-methylguanine or cigarette-smoke-derived O(6)-4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylguanine. These results reveal non-enzymatic DNA nucleotide flipping plus increased DNA distortion and binding pocket size compared to AGT. Our analysis of lesion-binding site conservation identifies new ATLs in sea anemone and ancestral archaea, indicating that ATL interactions are ancestral to present-day repair pathways in all domains of life. Genetic connections to mammalian XPG (also known as ERCC5) and ERCC1 in S. pombe homologues Rad13 and Swi10 and biochemical interactions with Escherichia coli UvrA and UvrC combined with structural results reveal that ATLs sculpt alkylated DNA to create a genetic and structural intersection of base damage processing with nucleotide excision repair."
18662541,1,J. Invest. Dermatol.,426720,2009,Stromal expression of MMP-13 is required for melanoma invasion and metastasis.,"Tumor invasion and metastasis of malignant melanoma have been shown to require proteolytic degradation of the extracellular environment achieved primarily by enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) family. We have earlier shown that increased enzyme activity is localized at the border of tumor cells and the adjacent peritumoral connective tissue, emphasizing the importance of tumor-stroma interactions in the regulation of MMP activity. To confirm the role of stroma-derived MMP-13 in the invasion process, we investigated the invasiveness of melanoma cells upon intradermal injection in mice with complete inactivation of MMP-13. Tumor growth was significantly impaired in mmp-13(-/-) mice and most significant at early time points as compared with wild-type littermates. Moreover, metastasis to various organs was reduced to 17.6 vs 30% in lungs, 2.9 vs 30% in the liver. Strikingly, ablation of MMP-13 completely abrogated formation of metastasis in the heart (0 vs 40%). Notably, decreased tumor growth in mmp-13(-/-) mice was associated with reduced blood vessel density. In addition, decreased blood vessel permeability in the tumors was measured by magnetic resonance imaging of tumor-bearing animals. These data suggest an important role of MMP-13 in tumor growth and an unexpected role in organ-specific metastasis of melanoma cells."
18666831,1,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,"A comparative analysis of phenylpropanoid metabolism, N utilization, and carbon partitioning in fast- and slow-growing Populus hybrid clones.","The biosynthetic costs of phenylpropanoid-derived condensed tannins (CTs) and phenolic glycosides (PGs) are substantial. However, despite reports of negative correlations between leaf phenolic content and growth of Populus, it remains unclear whether or how foliar biosynthesis of CT/PG interferes with tree growth. A comparison was made of carbon partitioning and N content in developmentally staged leaves, stems, and roots of two closely related Populus hybrid genotypes. The genotypes were selected as two of the most phytochemically divergent from a series of seven previously analysed clones that exhibit a range of height growth rates and foliar amino acid, CT, and PG concentrations. The objective was to analyse the relationship between leaf phenolic content and plant growth, using whole-plant carbon partitioning and N distribution data from the two divergent clones. Total N as a percentage of tissue dry mass was comparatively low, and CT and PG accrual comparatively high in leaves of the slow-growing clone. Phenylpropanoid accrual and N content were comparatively high in stems of the slow-growing clone. Carbon partitioning within phenylpropanoid and carbohydrate networks in developing stems differed sharply between clones. The results did not support the idea that foliar production of phenylpropanoid defence chemicals was the primary cause of reduced plant growth in the slow-growing clone. The findings are discussed in the context of metabolic mechanism(s) which may contribute to reduced N delivery from roots to leaves, thereby compromising tree growth and promoting leaf phenolic accrual in the slow-growing clone."
18671868,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,A quantitative assessment of the burden and distribution of Lisch nodules in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"PURPOSE: The presence of two or more Lisch nodules (melanocytic hamartomas of the iris) is one of seven diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder of dysregulated neurocutaneous growth. The hypothesis that Lisch nodules arise secondary to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight was investigated. METHODS: Lisch nodule burden was mapped and quantified in the irides of 77 adults with NF1. Lifetime sunlight (UV radiation) exposure was inventoried, NF1 neurocutaneous severity determined, and two NF1 mutations predictive of severity selectively genotyped. RESULTS: There was high interindividual variability in Lisch nodule burden. Lisch nodules were primarily located in the inferior hemifield (half) of the iris, regardless of its color (P = 3.0 x 10(-20)). Light irides harbored significantly more Lisch nodules than dark irides (P = 4.8 x 10(-5)). There was no statistically significant correlation of Lisch nodule burden to lifetime sunlight exposure &quot;dose&quot; or NF1 neurocutaneous severity. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in Lisch nodule burden between the superior and inferior iris hemifields is most likely due to the sunlight-shielding effects on the superior half by periocular structures. The difference in Lisch nodule burden between light and dark irides is probably due to the photoprotective effects of pigmentation. The genes underlying the control of iris color may thus be viewed as modifiers of severity of Lisch nodule burden in NF1. Given the role of UV radiation and, presumably, DNA damage in Lisch nodule pathogenesis, &quot;benign tumor of the iris,&quot; not &quot;hamartoma,&quot; may be a better descriptor."
18674809,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Alpha11 integrin in the human cornea: importance in development and disease.,"PURPOSE: To examine the distribution of the alpha11 integrin chain in the human cornea during fetal development and in normal and diseased adult human corneas. METHODS: Six fetal corneas, 10 to 20 weeks of gestation (wg), and 18 adult corneas including 3 normal, 7 with keratoconus, 5 with pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK), 2 with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy, and 1 with a scar after deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) were processed for immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against the alpha11 integrin chain; collagen I, IV, and V; and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The cellular source of alpha11 integrin chain was further investigated in cell cultures. RESULTS: At 10 to 17 wg, the alpha11 integrin chain was predominantly present in the anterior corneal stroma. At 20 wg, in normal adult corneas and in Fuchs' dystrophy corneas there was weak staining in the stroma. The PBK corneas showed variable and weak staining, generally accentuated in the posterior stroma near Descemet's membrane. In contrast, the anterior portion of the stroma in the keratoconus corneas was strongly stained in an irregular streaky pattern. Human corneal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts produced alpha11 integrin chain in culture. Cultures treated with TGF-beta showed higher content of both alpha-SMA and the alpha11 integrin chain. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the alpha11 integrin chain during early corneal development and the enhanced expression in scarred keratoconus corneas indicates that this integrin chain is likely to play an important role in collagen deposition during corneal development and in keratoconus with a scarring component and compromised basement membrane integrity."
18676613,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,"CD73, a novel cell surface antigen that characterizes retinal photoreceptor precursor cells.","PURPOSE: The authors sought to identify cell surface markers of photoreceptor and its precursor cells. METHODS: The expression of surface CD antigens that label both temporally and spatially distinct populations of mouse retinal cells were examined. Of the antibodies that showed positive signals in retinal cells, CD73 was focused on for more detailed analyses. RESULTS: Mouse retinal subpopulations that expressed CD73 first appeared around birth and subsequently increased dramatically in number, eventually representing more than 90% of the retinal cells in the adult. CD73(+) cells were postmitotic and mostly rhodopsin-negative at postnatal day 1. However, in the adult retina, most of these cells expressed rhodopsin but not s-opsin. In reaggregation cultures, CD73(+) cells differentiated into rhodopsin-positive cells more rapidly than CD73(-) cells, which supports the idea that CD73 is an early photoreceptor lineage marker. The effects of ectopic expression in retinal cells of Nrl and Crx, both of which are transcription factors known to be expressed in photoreceptor lineage, suggest that CD73 is genetically downstream of Crx in the rod cell differentiation lineage. Adult retina of the common marmoset monkey also showed correlation of the expression pattern of rhodopsin and CD73. CONCLUSIONS: CD73 is a cell surface marker of cone/rod common precursors and mature rod cells in mice and is genetically localized between Nrl and Crx. The expression of CD73 was conserved in primate rod cells, and CD73 provides an useful tool to purify photoreceptor cells for transplantation aimed at the regeneration of photoreceptors."
18678890,1,Genes Dev.,8711660,2009,Dysregulation of the Wnt pathway inhibits timely myelination and remyelination in the mammalian CNS.,"The progressive loss of CNS myelin in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed to result from the combined effects of damage to oligodendrocytes and failure of remyelination. A common feature of demyelinated lesions is the presence of oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs) blocked at a premyelinating stage. However, the mechanistic basis for inhibition of myelin repair is incompletely understood. To identify novel regulators of OLP differentiation, potentially dysregulated during repair, we performed a genome-wide screen of 1040 transcription factor-encoding genes expressed in remyelinating rodent lesions. We report that approximately 50 transcription factor-encoding genes show dynamic expression during repair and that expression of the Wnt pathway mediator Tcf4 (aka Tcf7l2) within OLPs is specific to lesioned-but not normal-adult white matter. We report that beta-catenin signaling is active during oligodendrocyte development and remyelination in vivo. Moreover, we observed similar regulation of Tcf4 in the developing human CNS and lesions of MS. Data mining revealed elevated levels of Wnt pathway mRNA transcripts and proteins within MS lesions, indicating activation of the pathway in this pathological context. We show that dysregulation of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling in OLPs results in profound delay of both developmental myelination and remyelination, based on (1) conditional activation of beta-catenin in the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo and (2) findings from APC(Min) mice, which lack one functional copy of the endogenous Wnt pathway inhibitor APC. Together, our findings indicate that dysregulated Wnt-beta-catenin signaling inhibits myelination/remyelination in the mammalian CNS. Evidence of Wnt pathway activity in human MS lesions suggests that its dysregulation might contribute to inefficient myelin repair in human neurological disorders."
18678909,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Conditional gene silencing of multiple genes with antisense RNAs and generation of a mutator strain of Escherichia coli.,"In this study, we describe a method of simultaneous conditional gene silencing of up to four genes in Escherichia coli by using antisense RNAs. We used antisense RNAs with paired termini, which carried flanking inverted repeats to create paired double-stranded RNA termini; these RNAs have been proven to have high silencing efficacy. To express antisense RNAs, we constructed four IPTG-inducible vectors carrying different but compatible replication origins. When the lacZ antisense RNA was expressed using these vectors, lacZ expression was successfully silenced by all the vectors, but the expression level of the antisense RNA and silencing efficacy differed depending on the used vectors. All the vectors were co-transformable; the antisense RNAs against lacZ, ackA, pta and pepN were co-expressed, and silencing of all the target genes was confirmed. Furthermore, when antisense RNAs were targeted to the mutator genes mutS, mutD (dnaQ) and ndk, which are involved in DNA replication or DNA mismatch repair, spontaneous mutation frequencies increased over 2000-fold. The resulting mutator strain is useful for random mutagenesis of plasmids. The method provides a robust tool for investigating functional relationships between multiple genes or altering cell phenotypes for biotechnological and industrial applications."
18678918,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Analysis of astroglial K+ channel expression in the developing hippocampus reveals a predominant role of the Kir4.1 subunit.,"Astrocytes in different brain regions display variable functional properties. In the hippocampus, astrocytes predominantly express time- and voltage-independent currents, but the underlying ion channels are not well defined. This ignorance is partly attributable to abundant intercellular coupling of these cells through gap junctions, impeding quantitative analyses of intrinsic membrane properties. Moreover, distinct types of cells with astroglial properties coexist in a given brain area, a finding that confused previous analyses. In the present study, we investigated expression of inwardly rectifying (Kir) and two-pore-domain (K2P) K+ channels in astrocytes, which are thought to be instrumental in the regulation of K+ homeostasis. Freshly isolated astrocytes were used to improve space-clamp conditions and allow for quantitative assessment of functional parameters. Patch-clamp recordings were combined with immunocytochemistry, Western blot analysis, and semiquantitative transcript analysis. Comparative measurements were performed in different CA1 subregions of astrocyte-targeted transgenic mice. While confirming weak Ba2+ sensitivity in situ, our data demonstrate that in freshly isolated astrocytes, the main proportion of membrane currents is sensitive to micromolar Ba2+ concentrations. Upregulation of Kir4.1 transcripts and protein during the first 10 postnatal days was accompanied by a fourfold increase in astrocyte inward current density. Hippocampal astrocytes from Kir4.1-/- mice lacked Ba2+-sensitive currents. In addition, we report functional expression of K2P channels of the TREK subfamily (TREK1, TREK2), which mediate astroglial outward currents. Together, our findings demonstrate that Kir4.1 constitutes the pivotal K+ channel subunit and that superposition of currents through Kir4.1 and TREK channels underlies the &quot;passive&quot; current pattern of hippocampal astrocytes."

Cell,9201390,2009,E-cadherin surface levels in epithelial growth factor-stimulated cells depend on adherens junction protein shrew-1.,"Gain- and loss-of-function studies indicate that the adherens junction protein shrew-1 acts as a novel modulator of E-cadherin internalization induced by epithelial growth factor (EGF) or E-cadherin function-blocking antibody during epithelial cell dynamics. Knocking down shrew-1 in MCF-7 carcinoma cells preserves E-cadherin surface levels upon EGF stimulation. Overexpression of shrew-1 leads to preformation of an E-cadherin/EGF receptor (EGFR) HER2/src-kinase/shrew-1 signaling complex and accelerated E-cadherin internalization. Shrew-1 is not sufficient to stimulate E-cadherin internalization, but facilitates the actions of EGFR and thus may promote malignant progression in breast cancer cells with constitutive EGFR stimulation by reducing surface E-cadherin expression."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Mrc1 phosphorylation in response to DNA replication stress is required for Mec1 accumulation at the stalled fork.,"DNA replication stress activates a response pathway that stabilizes stalled forks and promotes the completion of replication. The budding yeast Mec1 sensor kinase, Mrc1 mediator, and Rad53 effector kinase are central to this signal transduction cascade in S phase. We report that Mec1-dependent, Rad53-independent phosphorylation of Mrc1 is required to establish a positive feedback loop that stabilizes Mec1 and the replisome at stalled forks. A structure-function analysis of Mrc1 also uncovered a central region required for proper mediator function and association with replisome components. Together these results reveal new insight into how Mrc1 facilitates checkpoint signal amplification at stalled replication forks."
18682225,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Intracellular Ca2+ signaling and store-operated Ca2+ entry are required in Drosophila neurons for flight.,"Neuronal Ca(2+) signals can affect excitability and neural circuit formation. Ca(2+) signals are modified by Ca(2+) flux from intracellular stores as well as the extracellular milieu. However, the contribution of intracellular Ca(2+) stores and their release to neuronal processes is poorly understood. Here, we show by neuron-specific siRNA depletion that activity of the recently identified store-operated channel encoded by dOrai and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store sensor encoded by dSTIM are necessary for normal flight and associated patterns of rhythmic firing of the flight motoneurons of Drosophila melanogaster. Also, dOrai overexpression in flightless mutants for the Drosophila inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) can partially compensate for their loss of flight. Ca(2+) measurements show that Orai gain-of-function contributes to the quanta of Ca(2+)-release through mutant InsP(3)Rs and elevates store-operated Ca(2+) entry in Drosophila neurons. Our data show that replenishment of intracellular store Ca(2+) in neurons is required for Drosophila flight."
18682553,1,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Shock-induced stress induces loss of microvascular endothelial Tie2 in the kidney which is not associated with reduced glomerular barrier function.,"Both hemorrhagic shock and endotoxemia induce a pronounced vascular activation in the kidney which coincides with albuminuria and glomerular barrier dysfunction. We hypothesized that changes in Tie2, a vascular restricted receptor tyrosine kinase shown to control microvascular integrity and endothelial inflammation, underlie this loss of glomerular barrier function. In healthy murine and human kidney, Tie2 is heterogeneously expressed in all microvascular beds, although to different extents. In mice subjected to hemorrhagic and septic shock, Tie2 mRNA and protein were rapidly, and temporarily, lost from the renal microvasculature, and normalized within 24 h after initiation of the shock insult. The loss of Tie2 protein could not be attributed to shedding as both in mice and healthy volunteers subjected to endotoxemia, sTie2 levels in the systemic circulation did not change. In an attempt to identify the molecular control of Tie2, we activated glomerular endothelial cell cultures and human kidney slices in vitro with LPS or TNF-alpha, but did not observe a change in Tie2 mRNA levels. In parallel to the loss of Tie2 in vivo, an overt influx of neutrophils in the glomerular compartment, which coincided with proteinuria, was seen. As neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions may play a role in endothelial adaptation to shock, and these effects cannot be mimicked in vitro, we depleted neutrophils before shock induction. While this neutrophil depletion abolished proteinuria, Tie2 was not rescued, implying that Tie2 may not be a major factor controlling maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier in this model."
18682563,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Role of cholesterol pathways in norovirus replication.,"Norwalk virus (NV) is a prototype strain of the noroviruses (family Caliciviridae) that have emerged as major causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. I have developed NV replicon systems using reporter proteins such as a neomycin-resistant protein (NV replicon-bearing cells) and a green fluorescent protein (pNV-GFP) and demonstrated that these systems were excellent tools to study virus replication in cell culture. In the present study, I first performed DNA microarray analysis of the replicon-bearing cells to identify cellular factors associated with NV replication. The analysis demonstrated that genes in lipid (cholesterol) or carbohydrate metabolic pathways were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) changed by the gene ontology analysis. Among genes in the cholesterol pathways, I found that mRNA levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, squalene epoxidase, and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), ACAT2, small heterodimer partner, and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related proteins were significantly changed in the cells. I also found that the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis using statins (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) significantly increased the levels of NV proteins and RNA, whereas inhibitors of ACAT significantly reduced the replication of NV in replicon-bearing cells. Up- or downregulation of virus replication with these agents significantly correlated with the mRNA level of LDLR in replicon-bearing cells. Finally, I found that the expression of LDLR promoted NV replication in trans by transfection study with pNV-GFP. I conclude that the cholesterol pathways such as LDLR expression and ACAT activity may be crucial in the replication of noroviruses in cells, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for viral infection."
18682565,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Structural and functional elements of the promoter encoded by the 5' untranslated region of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus genome.,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is one of the most pathogenic members of the Alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family. The pathogenesis of this virus depends strongly on the sequences of the structural proteins and on the mutations in the RNA promoter encoded by the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the viral genome. In this study, we performed a detailed investigation of the structural and functional elements of the 5'-terminal promoter and analyzed the effect of multiple mutations introduced into the VEEV 5'UTR on virus and RNA replication. The results of this study demonstrate that RNA replication is determined by two synergistically functioning RNA elements. One of them is a very 5'-terminal AU dinucleotide, which is not involved in the stable RNA secondary structure, and the second is a short, G-C-rich RNA stem. An increase or decrease in the stem's stability has deleterious effects on virus and RNA replication. In response to mutations in these RNA elements, VEEV replicative machinery was capable of developing new, compensatory sequences in the 5'UTR either containing 5'-terminal AUG or AU repeats or leading to the formation of new, heterologous stem-loops. Analysis of the numerous compensatory mutations suggested that at least two different mechanisms are involved in their generation. Some of the modifications introduced into the 5' terminus of the viral genome led to an accumulation of the mutations in the VEEV nsPs, which suggested to us that there is a direct involvement of these proteins in promoter recognition. Furthermore, our data provide new evidence that the 3' terminus of the negative-strand viral genome in the double-stranded RNA replicative intermediate is represented by a single-stranded RNA. Both the overall folding and the sequence determine its efficient function as a promoter for VEEV positive-strand RNA genome synthesis."
18688254,1,BMC Struct. Biol.,101088689,2009,Structural and phylogenetic analysis of a conserved actinobacteria-specific protein (ASP1; SCO1997) from Streptomyces coelicolor.,"BACKGROUND: The Actinobacteria phylum represents one of the largest and most diverse groups of bacteria, encompassing many important and well-characterized organisms including Streptomyces, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium. Members of this phylum are remarkably diverse in terms of life cycle, morphology, physiology and ecology. Recent comparative genomic analysis of 19 actinobacterial species determined that only 5 genes of unknown function uniquely define this large phylum 1. The cellular functions of these actinobacteria-specific proteins (ASP) are not known. RESULTS: Here we report the first characterization of one of the 5 actinobacteria-specific proteins, ASP1 (Gene ID: SCO1997) from Streptomyces coelicolor. The X-ray crystal structure of ASP1 was determined at 2.2 A. The overall structure of ASP1 retains a similar fold to the large NP-1 family of nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes; however, the function is not related. Further comparative analysis revealed two regions expected to be important for protein function: a central, divalent metal ion binding pore, and a highly conserved elbow shaped helical region at the C-terminus. Sequence analyses revealed that ASP1 is paralogous to another actinobacteria-specific protein ASP2 (SCO1662 from S. coelicolor) and that both proteins likely carry out similar function. CONCLUSION: Our structural data in combination with sequence analysis supports the idea that two of the 5 actinobacteria-specific proteins, ASP1 and ASP2, mediate similar function. This function is predicted to be novel since the structures of these proteins do not match any known protein with or without known function. Our results suggest that this function could involve divalent metal ion binding/transport."

Pol.,14520300R,2009,Involvement of Rac/Cdc42/PAK pathway in cytoskeletal rearrangements.,"The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases interacting with small GTPases - Rac and Cdc42. PAKs are found in most eukaryotes and play an evolutionarily conserved role in many cellular processes. Six human PAKs have been identified, and based on homology, they can be classified into two groups. This review focuses specifically on the role of Rac/Cdc42 regulated PAKs in maintaining and remodeling cytoskeletal structure in various organisms. A list of PAKs substrates and binding partners implicated directly and indirectly in cytoskeletal reorganization is presented. Also perturbations of the Rac/Cdc42/PAK pathway leading to tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases are reviewed."
18688256,1,Plant Signal Behav,101291431,2008,Comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interactions between Arabidopsis MAPKs and MAPK kinases helps define potential MAPK signalling modules.,"The Arabidopsis genome encodes a 20-member gene family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) but biological roles have only been identified for a small subset of these crucial signalling components. In particular, it is unclear how the MPKs may be organized into functional modules within the cell. To gain insight into their potential relationships, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to conduct a directed protein-protein interaction screen between all the Arabidopsis MPKs and their upstream activators (MAPK kinases; MKK). Novel interactions were also tested in vitro for enzyme-substrate functionality, using recombinant proteins. The resulting data confirm a number of earlier reported MKK-MPK relationships, but also reveal a more extensive pattern of interactions that should help to guide future analyses of MAPK signalling in plants."
18692470,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"Cannabinoid CB2 receptor potentiates obesity-associated inflammation, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.","BACKGROUND: Obesity-associated inflammation is of critical importance in the development of insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since the cannabinoid receptor CB2 regulates innate immunity, the aim of the present study was to investigate its role in obesity-induced inflammation, insulin resistance and fatty liver. METHODOLOGY: Murine obesity models included genetically leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and wild type (WT) mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), that were compared to their lean counterparts. Animals were treated with pharmacological modulators of CB2 receptors. Experiments were also performed in mice knock-out for CB2 receptors (Cnr2 -/-). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In both HFD-fed WT mice and ob/ob mice, Cnr2 expression underwent a marked induction in the stromal vascular fraction of epididymal adipose tissue that correlated with increased fat inflammation. Treatment with the CB2 agonist JWH-133 potentiated adipose tissue inflammation in HFD-fed WT mice. Moreover, cultured fat pads isolated from ob/ob mice displayed increased Tnf and Ccl2 expression upon exposure to JWH-133. In keeping, genetic or pharmacological inactivation of CB2 receptors decreased adipose tissue macrophage infiltration associated with obesity, and reduced inductions of Tnf and Ccl2 expressions. In the liver of obese mice, Cnr2 mRNA was only weakly induced, and CB2 receptors moderately contributed to liver inflammation. HFD-induced insulin resistance increased in response to JWH-133 and reduced in Cnr2 -/- mice. Finally, HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was enhanced in WT mice treated with JWH-133 and blunted in Cnr2 -/- mice. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These data unravel a previously unrecognized contribution of CB2 receptors to obesity-associated inflammation, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and suggest that CB2 receptor antagonists may open a new therapeutic approach for the management of obesity-associated metabolic disorders."
18692471,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Validation of UBE2C protein as a prognostic marker in node-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We recently identified and validated UBE2C RNA as a prognostic marker in 252 node-positive (N+) breast cancers by means of a microarray study. The aim of this study was to validate UBE2C protein as a prognostic marker in N+ breast cancer by immunohistochemistry (IHC). METHODS: To this end, 92 paraffin-embedded blocks were used. The impact of UBE2C IHC value on metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated and compared with Ki-67 and Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) performances. RESULTS: In accordance with genomic data, UBE2C IHC had a significant impact both on MFS and OS (hazard ratio=6.79 - P=0.002; hazard ratio=7.14 - P=0.009, respectively). Akaike information criterion proved that the prognostic power of UBE2C IHC was stronger than that of Ki-67 (and close to that of NPI). Furthermore, multivariate analyses with NPI showed that, contrary to Ki-67 IHC, UBE2C IHC remained an independent factor, both for MFS (adjusted P=0.02) and OS (adjusted P=0.04). CONCLUSION: We confirmed that UBE2C protein measured by IHC could be used as a prognostic marker in N+ breast cancer. The potential predictive interest of UBE2C as a marker of proteasome activity needs further investigations."

Cancer,370635,2009,High-intensity-focused ultrasound in the treatment of primary prostate cancer: the first UK series.,"BACKGROUND: The use of minimally invasive ablative therapies in localised prostate cancer offer potential for a middle ground between active surveillance and radical therapy. METHODS: An analysis of men with organ-confined prostate cancer treated with transrectal whole-gland HIFU (Sonablate 500) between 1 February 2005 and 15 May 2007 was carried out in two centres. Outcome data (side-effects using validated patient questionnaires, biochemical, histology) were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 172 men were treated under general anaesthetic as day-case procedures with 78% discharged a mean 5 h after treatment. Mean follow-up was 346 days (range 135-759 days). Urethral stricture was significantly lower in those with suprapubic catheter compared with urethral catheters (19.4 vs 40.4%, P=0.005). Antibiotics were given to 23.8% of patients for presumed urinary tract infection and the rate of epididymitis was 7.6%. Potency was maintained in 70% by 12 months, whereas mild stress urinary incontinence (no pads) was reported in 7.0% (12 out of 172) with a further 0.6% (1 out of 172) requiring pads. There was no rectal toxicity and no recto-urethral fistulae. In all, 78.3% achieved a PSA nadir &lt; or =0.5 microg ml(-1) at 12 months, with 57.8% achieving &lt; or =0.2 microg ml(-1). Then, 8 out of 13 were retreated with HIFU, one had salvage external beam radiotherapy and four chose active surveillance for small-volume low-risk disease. Overall, there was no evidence of disease (PSA &lt;0.5 microg ml(-1) or negative biopsy if nadir not achieved) after one HIFU session in 92.4% (159 out of 172) of patients. CONCLUSION: HIFU is a minimally invasive, day-case ablative technique that can achieve good biochemical outcomes in the short term with minimal urinary incontinence and acceptable levels of erectile dysfunction. Long-term outcome needs further evaluation and the inception of an international registry for cases treated using HIFU will significantly aid this health technology assessment."
18700816,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,"Dasatinib synergizes with doxorubicin to block growth, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells.","BACKGROUND: Src family kinases control multiple cancer cell properties including cell cycle progression, survival, and metastasis. Recent studies suggest that the Src inhibitor dasatinib blocks these critical cancer cell functions. METHODS: Because the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib in breast cancers has not been investigated, we evaluated the effects of dasatinib as a single agent and in combination with the commonly used chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, on the proliferation, viability, and invasive capacity of breast cancer cells lines earlier categorised as dasatinib-sensitive (MDA-MB-231) and moderately resistant (MCF7 and T47D). We also tested the effects of these drugs on the actin cytoskeleton and associated signalling pathways. RESULTS: The cell lines tested varied widely in sensitivity to growth inhibition (IC(50)=0.16-12.3 microM), despite comparable Src kinase inhibition by dasatinib (IC(50)=17-37 nM). In the most sensitive cell line, MDA-MB-231, dasatinib treatment induced significant G(1) accumulation with little apoptosis, disrupted cellular morphology, blocked migration, inhibited invasion through Matrigel (P&lt;0.01), and blocked the formation of invadopodia (P&lt;0.001). Importantly, combination treatment with doxorubicin resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in all cell lines and blocked the migration and invasion of the highly metastatic, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line. CONCLUSION: The observed synergy between dasatinib and doxorubicin warrants the re-evaluation of dasatinib as an effective agent in multi-drug regimens for the treatment of invasive breast cancers."

Invest.,7802877,2009,A dyad of lymphoblastic lysosomal cysteine proteases degrades the antileukemic drug L-asparaginase.,"l-Asparaginase is a key therapeutic agent for treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). There is wide individual variation in pharmacokinetics, and little is known about its metabolism. The mechanisms of therapeutic failure with l-asparaginase remain speculative. Here, we now report that 2 lysosomal cysteine proteases present in lymphoblasts are able to degrade l-asparaginase. Cathepsin B (CTSB), which is produced constitutively by normal and leukemic cells, degraded asparaginase produced by Escherichia coli (ASNase) and Erwinia chrysanthemi. Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), which is overexpressed predominantly in high-risk subsets of ALL, specifically degraded ASNase. AEP thereby destroys ASNase activity and may also potentiate antigen processing, leading to allergic reactions. Using AEP-mediated cleavage sequences, we modeled the effects of the protease on ASNase and created a number of recombinant ASNase products. The N24 residue on the flexible active loop was identified as the primary AEP cleavage site. Sole modification at this site rendered ASNase resistant to AEP cleavage and suggested a key role for the flexible active loop in determining ASNase activity. We therefore propose what we believe to be a novel mechanism of drug resistance to ASNase. Our results may help to identify alternative therapeutic strategies with the potential of further improving outcome in childhood ALL."

Invest.,7802877,2009,Cellular effectors mediating Th17-dependent clearance of pneumococcal colonization in mice.,"Microbial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be an initial event in the progression to disease, and it is often a transient process. For the extracellular pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae studied in a mouse model, nasopharyngeal carriage is eliminated over a period of weeks and requires cellular rather than humoral immunity. Here, we demonstrate that primary infection led to TLR2-dependent recruitment of monocyte/macrophages into the upper airway lumen, where they engulfed pneumococci. Pharmacologic depletion of luminal monocyte/macrophages by intranasal instillation of liposomal clodronate diminished pneumococcal clearance. Efficient clearance of colonization required TLR2 signaling to generate a population of pneumococcal-specific IL-17-expressing CD4+ T cells. Depletion of either IL-17A or CD4+ T cells was sufficient to block the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages that allowed for effective late pneumococcal clearance. In contrast with naive mice, previously colonized mice showed enhanced early clearance that correlated with a more robust influx of luminal neutrophils. As for primary colonization, these cellular responses required Th17 immunity. Our findings demonstrate that monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils recruited to the mucosal surface are key effectors in clearing primary and secondary bacterial colonization, respectively."
18704118,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Phosphorylation of plant translation initiation factors by CK2 enhances the in vitro interaction of multifactor complex components.,"CK2 phosphorylates a wide variety of substrates, including translation initiation factors. A mass spectrometric approach was used to identify residues phosphorylated by CK2, which may regulate the activity of initiation factors during the translation initiation process in plants. CK2 in vitro phosphorylation sites were identified in wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana eIF2alpha, eIF2beta, eIF5, and wheat eIF3c. Native wheat eIF5 and eIF2alpha were found to have phosphorylation sites that corresponded to some of the in vitro CK2 phosphorylation sites. A large number of the CK2 sites identified in this study are in conserved binding domains that have been implicated in the yeast multifactor complex (eIF1-eIF3-eIF5-eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA(i)(Met)). This is the first study to demonstrate that plant initiation factors are capable of forming a multifactor complex in vitro. In addition, the interaction of factors within these complexes was enhanced both in vitro and in native extracts by phosphorylation of one or more initiation factors by CK2. The importance of CK2 phosphorylation of eIF5 was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis of eIF5 to remove CK2 phosphorylation sites. Removal of CK2 phosphorylation sites from eIF5 inhibits the CK2-mediated increase in eIF5 interaction with eIF1 and eIF3c in pulldown assays and reduces the eIF5-mediated stimulation of translation initiation in vitro. These results suggest a functional role for CK2 phosphorylation in the initiation of plant translation."
18713950,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Mechanisms associated with HIV-1 resistance to acyclovir by the V75I mutation in reverse transcriptase.,"It has recently been demonstrated that the anti-herpetic drug acyclovir (ACV) also displays antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The triphosphate form of ACV is accepted by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), and subsequent incorporation leads to classical chain termination. Like all approved nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs), the selective pressure of ACV is associated with the emergence of resistance. The V75I mutation in HIV-1 RT appears to be dominant in this regard. By itself, this mutation is usually not associated with resistance to currently approved NRTIs. Here we studied the underlying biochemical mechanism. We demonstrate that V75I is also selected under the selective pressure of a monophosphorylated prodrug that was designed to bypass the bottleneck in drug activation to the triphosphate form (ACV-TP). Pre-steady-state kinetics reveal that V75I discriminates against the inhibitor at the level of catalysis, whereas binding of the inhibitor remains largely unaffected. The incorporated ACV-monophosphate (ACV-MP) is vulnerable to excision in the presence of the pyrophosphate donor ATP. V75I compromises binding of the next nucleotide that can otherwise provide a certain degree of protection from excision. Collectively, the results of this study suggest that ACV is sensitive to two different resistance pathways, which warrants further investigation regarding the detailed resistance profile of ACV. Such studies will be crucial in assessing the potential clinical utility of ACV and its derivatives in combination with established NRTIs."
18715118,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Does vegetation prevent wave erosion of salt marsh edges?,"This study challenges the paradigm that salt marsh plants prevent lateral wave-induced erosion along wetland edges by binding soil with live roots and clarifies the role of vegetation in protecting the coast. In both laboratory flume studies and controlled field experiments, we show that common salt marsh plants do not significantly mitigate the total amount of erosion along a wetland edge. We found that the soil type is the primary variable that influences the lateral erosion rate and although plants do not directly reduce wetland edge erosion, they may do so indirectly via modification of soil parameters. We conclude that coastal vegetation is best-suited to modify and control sedimentary dynamics in response to gradual phenomena like sea-level rise or tidal forces, but is less well-suited to resist punctuated disturbances at the seaward margin of salt marshes, specifically breaking waves."
18719252,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,CcsBA is a cytochrome c synthetase that also functions in heme transport.,"Little is known about trafficking of heme from its sites of synthesis to sites of heme-protein assembly. We describe an integral membrane protein that allows trapping of endogenous heme to elucidate trafficking mechanisms. We show that CcsBA, a representative of a superfamily of integral membrane proteins involved in cytochrome c biosynthesis, exports and protects heme from oxidation. CcsBA has 10 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and reconstitutes cytochrome c synthesis in the Escherichia coli periplasm; thus, CcsBA is a cytochrome c synthetase. Purified CcsBA contains heme in an &quot;external heme binding domain&quot; for which two external histidines are shown to serve as axial ligands that protect the heme iron from oxidation. This is likely the active site of the synthetase. Furthermore, two conserved histidines in TMDs are required for heme to travel to the external heme binding domain. Remarkably, the function of CcsBA with mutations in these TMD histidines is corrected by exogenous imidazole, a result analogous to correction of heme binding by myoglobin when its proximal histidine is mutated. These data suggest that CcsBA has a heme binding site within the bilayer and that CcsBA is a heme channel."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Tie2cre-induced inactivation of the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer disrupts invariant NKT cell development.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs that are increasingly being recognized as important regulators of gene expression. The ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer is essential for the processing of miRNAs. CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are potent regulators of diverse immune responses. The role of Dicer-generated miRNAs in the development and function of immune regulatory iNKT cells is unknown. Here, we generated a mouse strain with a tissue-specific disruption of Dicer, and showed that lack of miRNAs after the deletion of Dicer by Tie2-Cre (expressed in hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells) interrupted the development and maturation of iNKT cells in the thymus and significantly decreased the number of iNKT cells in different immune organs. Thymic and peripheral iNKT cell compartments were changed in miRNA-deficient mice, with a significantly increased frequency of CD4(+)CD8(+) iNKT cells in the thymus and a significantly decreased frequency of CD4(+) iNKT cells in the spleen. MiRNA-deficient iNKT cells display profound defects in alpha-GalCer-induced activation and cytokine production. Bone marrow (BM) from miRNA-deficient mice poorly reconstituted iNKT cells compared to BM from WT mice. Also, using a thymic iNKT cell transfer model, we found that iNKT cell homeostasis was impaired in miRNA-deficient recipient mice. Our data indicate that miRNAs expressed in hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells are potent regulators of iNKT cell development, function, and homeostasis."
18724936,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of single-mismatch discrimination using single-molecule imaging.,"A single-molecule detection setup based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has been used to investigate association and dissociation kinetics of unlabeled 30mer DNA strands. Single-molecule sensitivity was accomplished by letting unlabeled DNA target strands mediate the binding of DNA-modified and fluorescently labeled liposomes to a DNA-modified surface. The liposomes, acting as signal enhancer elements, enabled the number of binding events as well as the residence time for high affinity binders (K(d) &lt; 1 nM, k(off) &lt; 0.01 s(-1)) to be collected under equilibrium conditions at low pM concentrations. The mismatch discrimination obtained from the residence time data was shown to be concentration and temperature independent in intervals of 1-100 pM and 23-46 degrees C, respectively. This suggests the method as a robust means for detection of point mutations at low target concentrations in, for example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis."
18762578,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,p73 plays a role in erythroid differentiation through GATA1 induction.,"The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis."
18769030,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,"CMTM3, located at the critical tumor suppressor locus 16q22.1, is silenced by CpG methylation in carcinomas and inhibits tumor cell growth through inducing apoptosis.","Closely located at the tumor suppressor locus 16q22.1, CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 3 and 4 (CMTM3 and CMTM4) encode two CMTM family proteins, which link chemokines and the transmembrane-4 superfamily. In contrast to the broad expression of both CMTM3 and CMTM4 in normal human adult tissues, only CMTM3 is silenced or down-regulated in common carcinoma (gastric, breast, nasopharyngeal, esophageal, and colon) cell lines and primary tumors. CMTM3 methylation was not detected in normal epithelial cell lines and tissues, with weak methylation present in only 5 of 35 (14%) gastric cancer adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that CMTM3 protein was absent in 12 of 35 (34%) gastric and 1 of 2 colorectal tumors, which was well correlated with its methylation status. The silencing of CMTM3 is due to aberrant promoter CpG methylation that could be reversed by pharmacologic demethylation. Ectopic expression of CMTM3 strongly suppressed the colony formation of carcinoma cell lines. In addition, CMTM3 inhibited tumor cell growth and induced apoptosis with caspase-3 activation. Thus, CMTM3 exerts tumor-suppressive functions in tumor cells, with frequent epigenetic inactivation by promoter CpG methylation in common carcinomas."
18772192,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Rock2 controls TGFbeta signaling and inhibits mesoderm induction in zebrafish embryos.,"The Rho-associated serine/threonine kinases Rock1 and Rock2 play important roles in cell contraction, adhesion, migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Here we report that Rock2 acts as a negative regulator of the TGFbeta signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Rock2 binds to and accelerates the lysosomal degradation of TGFbeta type I receptors internalized from the cell surface in mammalian cells. The inhibitory effect of Rock2 on TGFbeta signaling requires its kinase activity. In zebrafish embryos, injection of rock2a mRNA attenuates the expression of mesodermal markers during late blastulation and blocks the induction of mesoderm by ectopic Nodal signals. By contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative form of zebrafish rock2a, dnrock2a, has an opposite effect on mesoderm induction, suggesting that Rock2 proteins are endogenous inhibitors for mesoderm induction. Thus, our data have unraveled previously unidentified functions of Rock2, in controlling TGFbeta signaling as well as in regulating embryonic patterning."
18775313,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,A mutation in the Arabidopsis gamma-tubulin-containing complex causes helical growth and abnormal microtubule branching.,"Plant cortical microtubules are mainly nucleated on previously established microtubules, grow at a narrow range of angles to the wall of mother microtubules, and eventually are released from the nucleation sites. These nucleation events are thought to be regulated by gamma-tubulin-containing complexes. We here show that a null mutation of Arabidopsis GCP2, a core subunit of the gamma-tubulin-containing complex, severely impaired the development of male and female gametophytes. However, a missense mutation in the conserved grip1 motif, called spiral3, caused a left-handed helical organization of cortical microtubule arrays, and severe right-handed helical growth. The spiral3 mutation compromises interaction between GCP2 and GCP3, another subunit of the complex, in yeast. In the spiral3 mutant, microtubule dynamics and nucleation efficiency were not markedly affected, but nucleating angles were wider and more divergently distributed. A spiral3 katanin double mutant had swollen and twisted epidermal cells, and showed that the microtubule minus ends were not released from the nucleation sites, although the nucleating angles distributed in a similar manner to those in spiral3. These results show that Arabidopsis GCP2 has an important role in precisely positioning the gamma-tubulin-containing complex on pre-existing microtubules and in the proper organization of cortical arrays."
18775314,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Functional homology of mammalian syntaxin 16 and yeast Tlg2p reveals a conserved regulatory mechanism.,"Membrane fusion in all eukaryotic cells is regulated by the formation of specific SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complexes. The molecular mechanisms that control this process are conserved through evolution and require several protein families, including Sec1p/Munc18 (SM) proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian SNARE protein syntaxin 16 (Sx16, also known as Syn16) is a functional homologue of the yeast SNARE Tlg2p, in that its expression fully complements the mutant phenotypes of tlg2Delta mutant yeast. We have used this functional homology to demonstrate that, as observed for Tlg2p, the function of Sx16 is regulated by the SM protein Vps45p. Furthermore, in vitro SNARE-complex assembly studies demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of Tlg2p is inhibitory to the formation of SNARE complexes, and that this inhibition can be lifted by the addition of purified Vps45p. By combining these cell-biological and biochemical analyses, we propose an evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism for Vps45p function. Our data support a model in which the SM protein is required to facilitate a switch of Tlg2p and Sx16 from a closed to an open conformation, thus allowing SNARE-complex assembly and membrane fusion to proceed."
18775702,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Distinct roles for isoforms of the catalytic subunit of class-IA PI3K in the regulation of behaviour of murine embryonic stem cells.,"Self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is essential for maintenance of pluripotency, which is defined as the ability to differentiate into any specialised cell type comprising the adult organism. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate ESC self-renewal and proliferation is required before ESCs can fulfil their potential in regenerative therapies, and murine ESCs (mESCs) have been widely used as a model. Members of the class-IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family of lipid kinases regulate a variety of physiological responses, including cell migration, proliferation and survival. PI3Ks have been reported to regulate both proliferation and self-renewal of mESCs. Here we investigate the contribution of specific class-IA PI3K isoforms to the regulation of mESC fate using small-molecule inhibitors with selectivity for particular class-IA PI3K catalytic isoforms, and siRNA-mediated knockdown. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of p110beta promoted mESC differentiation, accompanied by a decrease in expression of Nanog. By comparison, pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110alpha had no effect on mESC self-renewal per se, but instead appeared to reduce proliferation, which was accompanied by inhibition of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and insulin-induced PI3K signalling. Our results suggest that PI3Ks contribute to the regulation of both mESC pluripotency and proliferation by differential coupling to selected p110 catalytic isoforms."

In this study, an anti-IL-33 antibody was evaluated against pulmonary inflammation in mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. The anti-IL-33 or a control antibody (150 microg/mouse) was given intraperitoneally as five doses before the sensitization and antigen challenge. Treatment with anti-IL-33 significantly reduced serum IgE secretion, the numbers of eosinophils and lymphocytes, and concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with administration of a control antibody. Histological examination of lung tissue demonstrated that anti-IL-33 significantly inhibited allergen-induced lung eosinophilic inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. Our data demonstrate for the first time that anti-IL-33 antibody can prevent the development of asthma in a mouse model and indicate that blockade of IL-33 may be a new therapeutic strategy for allergic asthma."
18781224,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Local alignment of two-base encoded DNA sequence.,"BACKGROUND: DNA sequence comparison is based on optimal local alignment of two sequences using a similarity score. However, some new DNA sequencing technologies do not directly measure the base sequence, but rather an encoded form, such as the two-base encoding considered here. In order to compare such data to a reference sequence, the data must be decoded into sequence. The decoding is deterministic, but the possibility of measurement errors requires searching among all possible error modes and resulting alignments to achieve an optimal balance of fewer errors versus greater sequence similarity. RESULTS: We present an extension of the standard dynamic programming method for local alignment, which simultaneously decodes the data and performs the alignment, maximizing a similarity score based on a weighted combination of errors and edits, and allowing an affine gap penalty. We also present simulations that demonstrate the performance characteristics of our two base encoded alignment method and contrast those with standard DNA sequence alignment under the same conditions. CONCLUSION: The new local alignment algorithm for two-base encoded data has substantial power to properly detect and correct measurement errors while identifying underlying sequence variants, and facilitating genome re-sequencing efforts based on this form of sequence data."
18786399,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,The 5' terminal uracil of let-7a is critical for the recruitment of mRNA to Argonaute2.,"Small RNAs modulate gene expression by forming a ribonucleoprotein complex with Argonaute proteins and directing them to specific complementary sites in target nucleic acids. However, the interactions required for the recruitment of the target nucleic acid to the ribonucleoprotein complex are poorly understood. In the present manuscript we have investigated this question by using let-7a, Argonaute2 and a fully complementary mRNA target. Importantly, we have found that recombinant Argonaute2 is sufficient to direct let-7a guided cleavage of mRNA. Thus this model system has allowed us to investigate the mechanistic basis of silencing in vitro and in vivo. Current models suggest that Argonaute proteins bind to both the 5' and 3' termini of the guide RNA. We have found that the termini of the let-7a microRNA are indeed critical, since circular let-7a does not support mRNA cleavage. However, the 5' end is the key determinant, since its deletion abrogates activity. Surprisingly, we have found that alteration of the 5' terminal uracil compromises mRNA cleavage. Importantly, we have found that substitution of this base has little effect upon the formation of the binary let-7a-Argonaute2 complex, but inhibits the formation of the ternary let-7a-Argonaute2-mRNA complex. Thus we conclude that the interaction of the 5' uracil base with Argonaute2 plays a critical and novel role in the recruitment of mRNA."

Widespread use of PPARgamma agonists has been prevented due to adverse effects including weight gain, edema, and increased risk of congestive heart failure. Selective PPARgamma modulators (SPPARgammaMs) have been identified that have antidiabetic efficacy and reduced toxicity in preclinical species. In comparison with PPARgamma full agonists, SPPARgammaM 6 (MK0533) displayed diminished maximal activity (partial agonism) in cell-based transcription activation assays and attenuated gene signatures in adipose tissue. Compound 6 exhibited comparable efficacy to rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in vivo. However, with regard to the induction of untoward events, 6 displayed no cardiac hypertrophy, attenuated increases in brown adipose tissue, minimal increases in plasma volume, and no increases in extracellular fluid volume in vivo. Further investigation of 6 is warranted to determine if the improvement in mechanism-based side effects observed in preclinical species will be recapitulated in humans."
18786403,1,Nature,410462,2009,A soma-to-germline transformation in long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants.,"Unlike the soma, which ages during the lifespan of multicellular organisms, the germ line traces an essentially immortal lineage. Genomic instability in somatic cells increases with age, and this decline in somatic maintenance might be regulated to facilitate resource reallocation towards reproduction at the expense of cellular senescence. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with increased longevity exhibit a soma-to-germline transformation of gene expression programs normally limited to the germ line. Decreased insulin-like signalling causes the somatic misexpression of the germline-limited pie-1 and pgl family of genes in intestinal and ectodermal tissues. The forkhead boxO1A (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16, the major transcriptional effector of insulin-like signalling, regulates pie-1 expression by directly binding to the pie-1 promoter. The somatic tissues of insulin-like mutants are more germline-like and protected from genotoxic stress. Gene inactivation of components of the cytosolic chaperonin complex that induce increased longevity also causes somatic misexpression of PGL-1. These results indicate that the acquisition of germline characteristics by the somatic cells of C. elegans mutants with increased longevity contributes to their increased health and survival."

Despite enormous conceptual strides, these two fields have developed largely along separate paths. Two widely employed theories are the resonating valence bond theory for high-temperature superconductivity and the composite fermion theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect. The goal of this perspective article is to note that they subscribe to a common underlying paradigm: They both connect these exotic quantum liquids to certain ordinary Fermi liquids residing in unphysical Hilbert spaces. Such a relation yields numerous nontrivial experimental consequences, exposing these theories to rigorous and definitive tests."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Starch as a major integrator in the regulation of plant growth.,"Rising demand for food and bioenergy makes it imperative to breed for increased crop yield. Vegetative plant growth could be driven by resource acquisition or developmental programs. Metabolite profiling in 94 Arabidopsis accessions revealed that biomass correlates negatively with many metabolites, especially starch. Starch accumulates in the light and is degraded at night to provide a sustained supply of carbon for growth. Multivariate analysis revealed that starch is an integrator of the overall metabolic response. We hypothesized that this reflects variation in a regulatory network that balances growth with the carbon supply. Transcript profiling in 21 accessions revealed coordinated changes of transcripts of more than 70 carbon-regulated genes and identified 2 genes (myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, a Kelch-domain protein) whose transcripts correlate with biomass. The impact of allelic variation at these 2 loci was shown by association mapping, identifying them as candidate lead genes with the potential to increase biomass production."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Implementation of National Fire Plan treatments near the wildland-urban interface in the western United States.,"Because of increasing concern about the effects of catastrophic wildland fires throughout the western United States, federal land managers have been engaged in efforts to restore historical fire behavior and mitigate wildfire risk. During the last 5 years (2004-2008), 44,000 fuels treatments were implemented across the western United States under the National Fire Plan (NFP). We assessed the extent to which these treatments were conducted in and near the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where they would have the greatest potential to reduce fire risk in neighboring homes and communities. Although federal policies stipulate that significant resources should be invested in the WUI, we found that only 3% of the area treated was within the WUI, and another 8% was in an additional 2.5-km buffer around the WUI, totaling 11%. Only 17% of this buffered WUI is under federal ownership, which significantly limits the ability of federal agencies to implement fire-risk reduction treatments near communities. Although treatments far from the WUI may have some fire mitigation benefits, our findings suggest that greater priority must be given to locating treatments in and near the WUI, rather than in more remote settings, to satisfy NFP goals of reducing fire risk to communities. However, this may require shifting management and policy emphasis from public to private lands."
18799746,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Setting the pace of the Neurospora circadian clock by multiple independent FRQ phosphorylation events.,"Protein phosphorylation plays essential roles in eukaryotic circadian clocks. Like PERIOD in animals, the Neurospora core circadian protein FRQ is progressively phosphorylated and becomes extensively phosphorylated before its degradation. In this study, by using purified FRQ protein from Neurospora, we identified 43 in vivo FRQ phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, we show that CK-1a and CKII are responsible for most FRQ phosphorylation events and identify an additional 33 phosphorylation sites by in vitro kinase assays. Whole-cell metabolic isotope labeling and quantitative MS analyses suggest that circadian oscillation of the FRQ phosphorylation profile is primarily due to progressive phosphorylation at the majority of these newly discovered phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, systematic mutations of the identified FRQ phosphorylation sites led to either long or short period phenotypes. These changes in circadian period are attributed to increases or decreases in FRQ stability, respectively. Together, this comprehensive study of FRQ phosphorylation reveals that regulation of FRQ stability by multiple independent phosphorylation events is a major factor that determines the period length of the clock. A model is proposed to explain how FRQ stability is regulated by multiple phosphorylation events."
18805088,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,The glutamate receptor subunit delta2 is capable of gating its intrinsic ion channel as revealed by ligand binding domain transplantation.,"The family of ionotropic glutamate receptors includes 2 subunits, delta1 and delta2, the physiological relevance of which remains poorly understood. Both are nonfunctional in heterologous expression systems, although the isolated, crystallized ligand binding domain (LBD) of delta2 is capable of binding D-serine. To investigate these seemingly contradictory observations we tested whether delta receptors can be ligand gated at all. We used a strategy that replaced the native LBD of delta2 by a proven glutamate-binding LBD. Test transplantations between alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainate receptors (GluR1 and GluR6, respectively) showed that this approach can produce functional chimeras even if only one part of the bipartite LBD is swapped. Upon outfitting delta2 with the LBD of GluR6, the chimera formed glutamate-gated ion channels with low Ca(2+) permeability and unique rectification properties. Ligand-induced conformational changes can thus gate delta2, suggesting that the LBD of this receptor works fundamentally differently from that of other ionotropic glutamate receptors."
18805089,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Enhanced cytoprotective effects of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cellular IAP1 through stabilization with TRAF2.,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are key regulators of intracellular signaling that interact with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily members as well as proapoptotic molecules such as Smac/DIABLO and caspases. Whereas the X-linked IAP is an established caspase inhibitor, the protective mechanisms utilized by the cellular IAP (c-IAP) proteins are less clear because c-IAPs bind to but do not inhibit the enzymatic activities of caspases. In this study, c-IAPs are shown to be highly unstable molecules that undergo autoubiquitination. The autoubiquitination of c-IAP1 is blocked upon coexpression with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, and this is achieved by inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity intrinsic to the RING of c-IAP1. Consistent with these observations, loss of TRAF2 results in a decrease in c-IAP1 levels. Stabilized c-IAP1 was found to sequester and prevent Smac/DIABLO from antagonizing X-linked IAP and protect against cell death. Therefore, this study describes an intriguing cytoprotective mechanism utilized by c-IAP1 and provides critical insight into how IAP proteins function to alter the apoptotic threshold."
18805092,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Rdh12 activity and effects on retinoid processing in the murine retina.,"RDH12 mutations are responsible for early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy, which results in profound retinal pathology and severe visual handicap in patients. To investigate the function of RDH12 within the network of retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (RDHs) present in retina, we studied the retinal phenotype of Rdh12-deficient mice. In vivo rates of all-trans-retinal reduction and 11-cis-retinal formation during recovery from bleaching were similar in Rdh12-deficient and wild-type mice matched for an Rpe65 polymorphism that impacts visual cycle efficiency. However, retinal homogenates from Rdh12-deficient mice exhibited markedly decreased capacity to reduce exogenous retinaldehydes in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo levels of the bisretinoid compound diretinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A2E) were increased in Rdh12-deficient mice of various genetic backgrounds. Conversely, in vivo levels of retinoic acid and total retinol were significantly decreased. Rdh12 transcript levels in wild-type mice homozygous for the Rpe65-Leu(450) polymorphism were greater than in Rpe65-Met(450) mice and increased during postnatal development in wild-type mice and Nrl-deficient mice having an all-cone retina. Rdh12-deficient mice did not exhibit increased retinal degeneration relative to wild-type mice at advanced ages, when bred on the light-sensitive BALB/c background, or when heterozygous for a null allele of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2(+/-)). Our findings suggest that a critical function of RDH12 is the reduction of all-trans-retinal that exceeds the reductive capacity of the photoreceptor outer segments."
18805093,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Glutamine 57 at the complementary binding site face is a key determinant of morantel selectivity for {alpha}7 nicotinic receptors.,"Nicotinic receptors (AChRs) play key roles in synaptic transmission. We explored activation of neuronal alpha7 and mammalian muscle AChRs by morantel and oxantel. Our results revealed a novel action of morantel as a high efficacy and more potent agonist than ACh of alpha7 receptors. The EC(50) for activation by morantel of both alpha7 and alpha7-5HT(3A) receptors is 7-fold lower than that determined for ACh. The minimum morantel concentration required to activate alpha7-5HT(3A) channels is 6-fold lower than that of ACh, and activation episodes are more prolonged than in the presence of ACh. By contrast, oxantel is a weak agonist of alpha7 and alpha7-5HT(3A), and both drugs are very low efficacy agonists of muscle AChRs. The replacement of Gln(57) in alpha7 by glycine, which is found in the equivalent position of the muscle AChR, decreases the efficacy for activation and turns morantel into a partial agonist. The reverse mutation in the muscle AChR (epsilonG57Q) increases 7-fold the efficacy of morantel. The mutations do not affect activation by ACh or oxantel, indicating that this position is selective for morantel. In silico studies show that the tetrahydropyrimidinyl group, common to both drugs, is close to Trp(149) of the principal face of the binding site, whereas the other cyclic group is proximal to Gln(57) of the complementary face in morantel but not in oxantel. Thus, position 57 at the complementary face is a key determinant of the high selectivity of morantel for alpha7. These results provide new information for further progress in drug design."
18812496,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,The incorporation of the novel histone variant H2AL2 confers unusual structural and functional properties of the nucleosome.,"In this work we have studied the properties of the novel mouse histone variant H2AL2. H2AL2 was used to reconstitute nucleosomes and the structural and functional properties of these particles were studied by a combination of biochemical approaches, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron cryo-microscopy. DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting as well as micrococcal and exonuclease III digestion demonstrated an altered structure of the H2AL2 nucleosomes all over the nucleosomal DNA length. Restriction nuclease accessibility experiments revealed that the interactions of the H2AL2 histone octamer with the ends of the nucleosomal DNA are highly perturbed. AFM imaging showed that the H2AL2 histone octamer was complexed with only approximately 130 bp of DNA. H2AL2 reconstituted trinucleosomes exhibited a type of a 'beads on a string' structure, which was quite different from the equilateral triangle 3D organization of conventional H2A trinucleosomes. The presence of H2AL2 affected both the RSC and SWI/SNF remodeling and mobilization of the variant particles. These unusual properties of the H2AL2 nucleosomes suggest a specific role of H2AL2 during mouse spermiogenesis."
18812497,1,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Extensive DNA mimicry by the ArdA anti-restriction protein and its role in the spread of antibiotic resistance.,"The ardA gene, found in many prokaryotes including important pathogenic species, allows associated mobile genetic elements to evade the ubiquitous Type I DNA restriction systems and thereby assist the spread of resistance genes in bacterial populations. As such, ardA contributes to a major healthcare problem. We have solved the structure of the ArdA protein from the conjugative transposon Tn916 and find that it has a novel extremely elongated curved cylindrical structure with defined helical grooves. The high density of aspartate and glutamate residues on the surface follow a helical pattern and the whole protein mimics a 42-base pair stretch of B-form DNA making ArdA by far the largest DNA mimic known. Each monomer of this dimeric structure comprises three alpha-beta domains, each with a different fold. These domains have the same fold as previously determined proteins possessing entirely different functions. This DNA mimicry explains how ArdA can bind and inhibit the Type I restriction enzymes and we demonstrate that 6 different ardA from pathogenic bacteria can function in Escherichia coli hosting a range of different Type I restriction systems."
18817453,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,The recombination protein RAD52 cooperates with the excision repair protein OGG1 for the repair of oxidative lesions in mammalian cells.,"Oxidized bases are common types of DNA modifications. Their accumulation in the genome is linked to aging and degenerative diseases. These modifications are commonly repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) initiates BER of oxidized purine bases. A small number of protein interactions have been identified for OGG1, while very few appear to have functional consequences. We report here that OGG1 interacts with the recombination protein RAD52 in vitro and in vivo. This interaction has reciprocal functional consequences as OGG1 inhibits RAD52 catalytic activities and RAD52 stimulates OGG1 incision activity, likely increasing its turnover rate. RAD52 colocalizes with OGG1 after oxidative stress to cultured cells, but not after the direct induction of double-strand breaks by ionizing radiation. Human cells depleted of RAD52 via small interfering RNA knockdown, and mouse cells lacking the protein via gene knockout showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, cells depleted of RAD52 show higher accumulation of oxidized bases in their genome than cells with normal levels of RAD52. Our results indicate that RAD52 cooperates with OGG1 to repair oxidative DNA damage and enhances the cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Our observations suggest a coordinated action between these proteins that may be relevant when oxidative lesions positioned close to strand breaks impose a hindrance to RAD52 catalytic activities."
18817773,1,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,Directed mutagenesis of the Rickettsia prowazekii pld gene encoding phospholipase D.,"Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus, is an obligately intracytoplasmic bacterium, a lifestyle that imposes significant barriers to genetic manipulation. The key to understanding how this unique bacterium evades host immunity is the mutagenesis of selected genes hypothesized to be involved in virulence. The R. prowazekii pld gene, encoding a protein with phospholipase D activity, has been associated with phagosomal escape. To demonstrate the feasibility of site-directed knockout mutagenesis of rickettsial genes and to generate a nonrevertible vaccine strain, we utilized homologous recombination to generate a pld mutant of the virulent R. prowazekii strain Madrid Evir. Using linear DNA for transformation, a double-crossover event resulted in the replacement of the rickettsial wild-type gene with a partially deleted pld gene. Linear DNA was used to prevent potentially revertible single-crossover events resulting in plasmid insertion. Southern blot and PCR analyses were used to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to demonstrate clonality. While no phenotypic differences were observed between the mutant and wild-type strains when grown in tissue culture, the pld mutant exhibited attenuated virulence in the guinea pig model. In addition, animals immunized with the mutant strain were protected against subsequent challenge with the virulent Breinl strain, suggesting that this transformant could serve as a nonrevertible, attenuated vaccine strain. This study demonstrates the feasibility of generating site-directed rickettsial gene mutants, providing a new tool for understanding rickettsial biology and furthering advances in the prevention of epidemic typhus."
18818666,1,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,Reintroduction of two deleted virulence loci restores full virulence to the live vaccine strain of Francisella tularensis.,"A disadvantage of several old vaccines is that the genetic events resulting in the attenuation are often largely unknown and reversion to virulence cannot be excluded. In the 1950s, a live vaccine strain, LVS, was developed from a type B strain of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. LVS, which is highly attenuated for humans but still virulent for mice by some infection routes, has been extensively studied and found to protect staff from laboratory-acquired tularemia. The efforts to improve biopreparedness have identified a demand for a vaccine against tularemia. Recently the rapid progress in genomics of different Francisella strains has led to identification of several regions of differences (RDs). Two genes carried within RDs, pilA, encoding a putative type IV pilin, and FTT0918, encoding an outer membrane protein, have been linked to virulence. Interestingly, LVS has lost these two genes via direct repeat-mediated deletions. Here we show that reintroduction of the two deleted regions restores virulence of LVS in a mouse infection model to a level indistinguishable from that of virulent type B strains. The identification of the two attenuating deletion events could facilitate the licensing of LVS for use in humans."

Immun.,246127,2009,Streptococcus mitis phage-encoded adhesins mediate attachment to {alpha}2-8-linked sialic acid residues on platelet membrane gangliosides.,"The direct binding of bacteria to human platelets contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Platelet binding by Streptococcus mitis strain SF100 is mediated in part by two bacteriophage-encoded proteins, PblA and PblB. However, the platelet membrane receptor for these adhesins has been unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that these proteins mediate attachment of bacterial cells to sialylated gangliosides on the platelet cell surface. Desialylation of human platelet monolayers reduced adherence of SF100, whereas treatment of the platelets with N- or O-glycanases did not affect platelet binding. Treatment of platelets with sialidases having different linkage specificities showed that removal of alpha2-8-linked sialic acids resulted in a marked reduction in bacterial binding. Preincubation of SF100 with ganglioside GD3, a glycolipid containing alpha2-8-linked sialic acids that is present on platelet membranes, blocked subsequent binding of this strain to these cells. In contrast, GD3 had no effect on the residual binding of platelets by strain PS344, an isogenic DeltapblA DeltapblB mutant. Preincubating platelets with specific monoclonal antibodies to ganglioside GD3 also inhibited binding of SF100 to platelets, but again, they had no effect on binding by PS344. When the direct binding of S. mitis strains SF100 and PS344 to immobilized gangliosides was tested, binding of PS344 to GD3 was reduced by 70% compared to the parent strain. These results indicated that platelet binding by SF100 is mediated by the interaction of PblA and PblB with alpha2-8-linked sialic acids on ganglioside GD3."
18827182,1,Retrovirology,101216893,2009,Nef gene evolution from a single transmitted strain in acute SIV infection.,"BACKGROUND: The acute phase of immunodeficiency virus infection plays a crucial role in determining steady-state virus load and subsequent progression of disease in both humans and nonhuman primates. The acute period is also the time when vaccine-mediated effects on host immunity are likely to exert their major effects on virus infection. Recently we developed a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation with mathematical analysis of viral evolution during primary HIV-1 infection that enables classification of new HIV-1 infections originating from multiple versus single transmitted viral strains and the estimation of time elapsed following infection. RESULTS: A total of 322 SIV nef SIV sequences, collected during the first 3 weeks following experimental infection of two rhesus macaques with the SIVmac239 clone, were analyzed and found to display a comparable level of genetic diversity, 0.015% to 0.052%, with that of env sequences from acute HIV-1 infection, 0.005% to 0.127%. We confirmed that the acute HIV-1 infection model correctly identified the experimental SIV infections in rhesus macaques as &quot;homogenous&quot; infections, initiated by a single founder strain. The consensus sequence of the sampled strains corresponded to the transmitted sequence as the model predicted. However, measured sequential decrease in diversity at day 7, 11, and 18 post infection violated the model assumption, neutral evolution without any selection. CONCLUSION: While nef gene evolution over the first 3 weeks of SIV infection originating from a single transmitted strain showed a comparable rate of sequence evolution to that observed during acute HIV-1 infection, a purifying selection for the founder nef gene was observed during the early phase of experimental infection of a nonhuman primate."

The sodalite-type structure of the framework consists of BTTri(3-)-linked [Cu(4)Cl](7+) square clusters in which each Cu(II) center has a terminal DMF ligand directed toward the interior of a large pore. The framework exhibits a high thermal stability of up to 270 degrees C, as well as exceptional chemical stability in air, boiling water, and acidic media. Following exchange of the guest solvent and bound DMF molecules for methanol to give 1-MeOH, complete desolvation of the framework at 180 degrees C generated H(3)[(Cu(4)Cl)(3)(BTTri)(8)] (1) with exposed Cu(II) sites on its surface. Following a previously reported protocol, ethylenediamine molecules were grafted onto these sites to afford 1-en, featuring terminal alkylamine groups. The N(2) adsorption isotherms indicate a reduction in the BET surface area from 1770 to 345 m(2)/g following grafting. The H(2) adsorption data at 77 K for 1 indicate a fully reversible uptake of 1.2 wt % at 1.2 bar, while the CO(2) isotherm at 195 K shows a maximal uptake of 90 wt % at 1 bar. Compared to 1, the alkylamine-functionalized framework 1-en exhibits a higher uptake of CO(2) at 298 K and pressures up to ca. 0.1 bar, as well as a higher CO(2)/N(2) selectivity at all measured pressures. Significantly, 1-en also exhibits an isosteric heat of CO(2) adsorption of 90 kJ/mol, which is much higher than the 21 kJ/mol observed for 1. This chemisorption interaction is the strongest reported to date for a metal-organic framework and points toward the potential utility of alkylamine-appended frameworks for the postcombustion capture of CO(2) from low-pressure flue gas streams."

The biomimetic model of the bacterial &quot;special pair&quot; donor, a cofacial zinc phthalocyanine dimer, was formed via potassium ion induced dimerization of 4,5,4',5',4'', 5'',4''',5'''-zinc tetrakis(1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxatridecamethylene)phthalocyanine. The dimer was subsequently self-assembled with functionalized fullerenes via &quot;two-point&quot; binding involving axial coordination and crown ether-alkyl ammonium cation complexation to form the donor-acceptor pair, mimicking the noncovalently bound entities of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center. The adopted self-assembly methodology yielded a supramolecular complex of higher stability with defined geometry and orientation as revealed by the binding constant and computational optimized structure. Unlike the previously reported porphyrin analog, the present phthalocyanine macrocycle based model system exhibited superior electron-transfer properties including formation of a long-lived charge-separated state, a key step of the photosynthetic light energy conversion process. Detailed analysis of the kinetic data in light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer revealed that small reorganization energy of the relatively rigid phthalocyanine is primarily responsible for slower charge-recombination process. The importance of the cofacial dimer in stabilizing the charge-separated state is borne out in the present all-supramolecular &quot;reaction center&quot; donor-acceptor mimic."
18836139,1,J. Proteome Res.,101128775,2009,Multiple products monitoring as a robust approach for peptide quantification.,"Quantification of target peptides and proteins is crucial for biomarker discovery. Approaches such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) rely on liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis of defined peptide product ions. These methods are not very widespread because the determination of quantifiable product ion using either SRM or MRM is a very time-consuming process. We developed a novel approach for quantifying target peptides without such an arduous process of ion selection. This method is based on monitoring multiple product ions (multiple products monitoring: MpM) from full-range MS2 spectra of a target precursor. The MpM method uses a scoring system that considers both the absolute intensities of product ions and the similarities between the query MS2 spectrum and the reference MS2 spectrum of the target peptide. Compared with conventional approaches, MpM greatly improves sensitivity and selectivity of peptide quantification using an ion-trap mass spectrometer."

Recently, computational prediction of sumoylation sites has attracted much attention for its cost-efficiency and power in genomic data mining. In this work, we developed SUMOsp 2.0, an accurate computing program with an improved group-based phosphorylation scoring algorithm. Our analysis demonstrated that SUMOsp 2.0 has greater prediction accuracy than SUMOsp 1.0 and other existing tools, with a sensitivity of 88.17% and a specificity of 92.69% under the medium threshold. Previously, several large-scale experiments have identified a list of potential sumoylated substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens; however, the exact sumoylation sites in most of these proteins remain elusive. We have predicted potential sumoylation sites in these proteins using SUMOsp 2.0, which provides a great resource for researchers and an outline for further mechanistic studies of sumoylation in cellular plasticity and dynamics. The online service and local packages of SUMOsp 2.0 are freely available at: http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/."
18849490,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,SpaK/SpaR two-component system characterized by a structure-driven domain-fusion method and in vitro phosphorylation studies.,"Here we introduce a quantitative structure-driven computational domain-fusion method, which we used to predict the structures of proteins believed to be involved in regulation of the subtilin pathway in Bacillus subtilis, and used to predict a protein-protein complex formed by interaction between the proteins. Homology modeling of SpaK and SpaR yielded preliminary structural models based on a best template for SpaK comprising a dimer of a histidine kinase, and for SpaR a response regulator protein. Our LGA code was used to identify multi-domain proteins with structure homology to both modeled structures, yielding a set of domain-fusion templates then used to model a hypothetical SpaK/SpaR complex. The models were used to identify putative functional residues and residues at the protein-protein interface, and bioinformatics was used to compare functionally and structurally relevant residues in corresponding positions among proteins with structural homology to the templates. Models of the complex were evaluated in light of known properties of the functional residues within two-component systems involving His-Asp phosphorelays. Based on this analysis, a phosphotransferase complexed with a beryllofluoride was selected as the optimal template for modeling a SpaK/SpaR complex conformation. In vitro phosphorylation studies performed using wild type and site-directed SpaK mutant proteins validated the predictions derived from application of the structure-driven domain-fusion method: SpaK was phosphorylated in the presence of (32)P-ATP and the phosphate moiety was subsequently transferred to SpaR, supporting the hypothesis that SpaK and SpaR function as sensor and response regulator, respectively, in a two-component signal transduction system, and furthermore suggesting that the structure-driven domain-fusion approach correctly predicted a physical interaction between SpaK and SpaR. Our domain-fusion algorithm leverages quantitative structure information and provides a tool for generation of hypotheses regarding protein function, which can then be tested using empirical methods."
18854157,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Sulindac enhances the killing of cancer cells exposed to oxidative stress.,"BACKGROUND: Sulindac is an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that affects prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2. Sulindac has also been of interest for more than decade as a chemopreventive for adenomatous colorectal polyps and colon cancer. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pretreatment of human colon and lung cancer cells with sulindac enhances killing by an oxidizing agent such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or hydrogen peroxide. This effect does not involve cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. However, under the conditions used, there is a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cancer cells and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that cell death is due to apoptosis, which was confirmed by Tunel assay. In contrast, this enhanced killing was not observed with normal lung or colon cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that normal and cancer cells handle oxidative stress in different ways and sulindac can enhance this difference. The combination of sulindac and an oxidizing agent could have therapeutic value."

These members are divided into membrane-type and secretory-type proteins. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel Ly-6 domain protein, secreted protein of Ly-6 domain 1 (SOLD1), from bovine placenta. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SOLD1 mRNA was expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells and the protein was secreted into and localized in the extracellular matrix of the mesenchyme in cotyledonary villi. SOLD1 bound mainly with type I collagen telopeptide. We confirmed secretion of SOLD1 from the basolateral surface of a bovine trophoblast cell line (BT-1). It may be related to the organization of the extra-cellular matrix in the mesenchyme of fetal villi. Since trophoblast mononucleate cells are epithelial cells, their polar organization is expected to have a crucial role in the SOLD1 secretion system. We established that SOLD1 is an intronless bovine gene containing the Alu retrotransposon, which was integrated via cytoplasmic reverse transcription. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel retrotransposon-like Ly-6 domain protein in bovine placenta. SOLD1 is a crucial secreted protein that is involved in the organization of the mesenchyme of the cotyledonary villi. Furthermore, the gene encoding SOLD1 has an interesting genomic structure."
18854161,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of ataxin-3.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), is one of many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated genes. Disease protein misfolding and aggregation, often within the nucleus of affected neurons, characterize polyglutamine disorders. Several evidences have implicated the nucleus as the primary site of pathogenesis for MJD. However, the molecular determinants for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of human ataxin-3 (Atx3), the protein which is mutated in patients with MJD, are not characterized. In order to characterize the nuclear shuttling activity of Atx3, we performed yeast nuclear import assays and found that Atx3 is actively imported into the nucleus, by means of a classical nuclear localizing sequence formed by a cluster of lysine and arginine residues. On the other hand, when active nuclear export was inhibited using leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, both endogenous Atx3 and transfected GFP-Atx3 accumulated inside the nucleus of a subpopulation of COS-7 cells, whereas both proteins are normally predominant in the cytoplasm. Additionally, using a Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay, we performed an extensive analysis of six putative aliphatic nuclear export motifs identified in Atx3 amino acid sequence. Although none of the tested peptide sequences were found to drive nuclear export when isolated, we have successfully mapped the region of Atx3 responsible for its CRM1-independent nuclear export activity. Curiously, the N-terminal Josephin domain alone is exported into the cytoplasm, but the nuclear export activity of Atx3 is significantly enhanced in a longer construct that is truncated after the two ubiquitin interaction motifs, upstream from the polyQ tract. Our data show that Atx3 is actively imported to and exported from the cell nucleus, and that its nuclear export activity is dependent on a motif located at its N-terminal region. Since pathological Atx3 aggregates in the nucleus of affected neurons in MJD, and there is in vivo evidence that nuclear localization of Atx3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in MJD, defects in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein may be involved in the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of expanded Atx3."
18854162,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,WNT/beta-catenin signalling and epithelial patterning in the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella.,"Sponges branch basally in the metazoan phylogenetic tree and are thus well positioned to provide insights into the evolution of mechanisms controlling animal development, likely to remain active in adult sponges. Of the four sponge clades, the Homoscleromorpha are of particular interest as they alone show the &quot;true&quot; epithelial organization seen in other metazoan phyla (the Eumetazoa). We have examined the deployment in sponges of Wnt signalling pathway components, since this pathway is an important regulator of many developmental patterning processes. We identified a reduced repertoire of three divergent Wnt ligand genes in the recently-sequenced Amphimedon queenslandica (demosponge) genome and two Wnts from our EST collection from the homoscleromorph Oscarella lobularis, along with well-conserved genes for intracellular pathway components (beta-catenin, GSK3beta). Remarkably, the two O. lobularis Wnt genes showed complementary expression patterns in relation to the evenly spaced ostia (canal openings) of the exopinacoderm (ectoderm), highly reminiscent of Wnt expression during skin appendage formation in vertebrates. Furthermore, experimental activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway using GSK3beta inhibitors provoked formation of ectopic ostia, as has been shown for epithelial appendages in Eumetazoa. We thus suggest that deployment of Wnt signalling is a common and perhaps ancient feature of metazoan epithelial patterning and morphogenesis."
18923139,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Cross-talk between TLR4 and FcgammaReceptorIII (CD16) pathways.,"Pathogen-pattern-recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pathogen clearance after immune complex formation via engagement with Fc receptors (FcRs) represent central mechanisms that trigger the immune and inflammatory responses. In the present study, a linkage between TLR4 and FcgammaR was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Most strikingly, in vitro activation of phagocytes by IgG immune complexes (IgGIC) resulted in an association of TLR4 with FcgammaRIII (CD16) based on co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Neutrophils and macrophages from TLR4 mutant (mut) mice were unresponsive to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IgGIC in vitro, as determined by cytokine production. This phenomenon was accompanied by the inability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the FcRgamma-subunit. To transfer these findings in vivo, two different models of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by intratracheal administration of either LPS or IgGIC were employed. As expected, LPS-induced ALI was abolished in TLR4 mut and TLR4(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, TLR4 mut and TLR4(-/-) mice were also resistant to development of ALI following IgGIC deposition in the lungs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TLR4 and FcgammaRIII pathways are structurally and functionally connected at the receptor level and that TLR4 is indispensable for FcgammaRIII signaling via FcRgamma-subunit activation."
18927509,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,Pervasive natural selection in the Drosophila genome?,"Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike."
18927584,1,Oncogene,8711562,2009,Reactive oxygen species and lipoxygenases regulate the oncogenicity of NPM-ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas.,"The chimera nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), the tyrosine kinase activity of which is constitutively upregulated, is the causative agent of 75% of the anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs). We have demonstrated that NPM-ALK induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a pathway involving the arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family. The use of the LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) demonstrated that ROS are important in maintaining the ALK kinase active. Consistent with this, NDGA treatment resulted in the inhibition of key pathways, such as Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are involved in NPM-ALK antiapoptotic and pro-mitogenic functions. Conversely, the stress-activated kinase p38, described in some instances as a mediator of apoptosis, was activated. Interestingly, 5-LOX, an isoform involved in many cancers, was found to be activated in NPM-ALK(+) cells. Functional studies have shown that transforming properties, namely proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, were abrogated by treatment with either NDGA or the 5-LOX inhibitor (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)-acetohydroxamic acid) (BW A4C). Together, these data point to the ROS/LOX pathway as a potential new target for therapy in NPM-ALK-positive tumors."

18957204,1,Nat. Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,Cell shape changes indicate a role for extrinsic tensile forces in Drosophila germ-band extension.,"Drosophila germ-band extension (GBE) is an example of the convergence and extension movements that elongate and narrow embryonic tissues. To understand the collective cell behaviours underlying tissue morphogenesis, we have continuously quantified cell intercalation and cell shape change during GBE. We show that the fast, early phase of GBE depends on cell shape change in addition to cell intercalation. In antero-posterior patterning mutants such as those for the gap gene Krüppel, defective polarized cell intercalation is compensated for by an increase in antero-posterior cell elongation, such that the initial rate of extension remains the same. Spatio-temporal patterns of cell behaviours indicate that an antero-posterior tensile force deforms the germ band, causing the cells to change shape passively. The rate of antero-posterior cell elongation is reduced in twist mutant embryos, which lack mesoderm. We propose that cell shape change contributing to germ-band extension is a passive response to mechanical forces caused by the invaginating mesoderm."
18977328,1,Cell Cycle,101137841,2009,Cancer cells harboring MET gene amplification activate alternative signaling pathways to escape MET inhibition but remain sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors.,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor c-Met is implicated in growth, invasion and metastasis of many tumors. Tumor cells harboring MET gene amplification are initially sensitive to c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but escape from long-term treatment has not been investigated. C-Met is a client of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and is destabilized by Hsp90 inhibitors, suggesting that these drugs may inhibit tumors driven by MET amplification, although tumor escape under these conditions also has not been explored. Here, we evaluated the initial inhibitory effects of, and the likelihood of escape from, the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and the c-Met TKI SU11274, using two cell lines harboring MET gene amplification. 17-AAG inhibited cell growth in both cell lines and induced substantial apoptosis, whereas SU11274 was only growth inhibitory in one cell line. In both cell lines, c-Met-dependent Akt, Erk and/or STAT3 signaling, as well as activation of the EGFR family, resumed shortly after treatment with c-Met TKI despite sustained c-Met inhibition. PKC delta upregulation may participate in reactivation of c-Met downstream signaling in both cell lines. In contrast to c-Met TKI, 17-AAG destabilized c-Met protein and durably blocked reactivation of downstream signaling pathways and EGFR family members. Our data demonstrate that downstream signaling in tumor cells overexpressing c-Met is not stably suppressed by c-Met TKI, even though c-Met remains fully inhibited. In contrast, Hsp90 inhibitors provide long-lasting suppression of c-Met-dependent signaling, and these drugs should be further evaluated in tumors driven by MET gene amplification."
18984164,1,Cell Cycle,101137841,2009,Cell cycle checkpoint defects contribute to genomic instability in PTEN deficient cells independent of DNA DSB repair.,"Chromosomes in PTEN deficient cells display both numerical as well as structural alterations including regional amplification. We found that PTEN deficient cells displayed a normal DNA damage response (DDR) as evidenced by the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced phosphorylation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) as well as its effectors. PTEN deficient cells also had no defect in Rad51 expression or DNA damage repair kinetics post irradiation. In contrast, caffeine treatment specifically increased IR-induced chromosome aberrations and mitotic index only in cells with PTEN, and not in cells deficient for PTEN, suggesting that their checkpoints were defective. Furthermore, PTEN-deficient cells were unable to maintain active spindle checkpoint after taxol treatment. Genomic instability in PTEN deficient cells could not be attributed to lack of PTEN at centromeres, since no interaction was detected between centromeric DNA and PTEN in wild type cells. These results indicate that PTEN deficiency alters multiple cell cycle checkpoints possibly leaving less time for DNA damage repair and/or chromosome segregation as evidenced by the increased structural as well as numerical alterations seen in PTEN deficient cells."

Biochem.,9205717,2009,Specific inhibitors of mammalian DNA polymerase species.,"In screening of selective inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA polymerases (pols) for 15 years, more than 100 inhibitors have been discovered from natural and chemical sources. Some compounds selectively inhibit the activities of mammalian pols, and in particular, dehydroaltenusin and curcumin derivatives, such as monoacetyl-curcumin, were found to be specific inhibitors of pol alpha and pol lambda, respectively. Dehydroaltenusin was isolated from a fungus (Alternaria tennuis), and this compound inhibited cell proliferation of human cancer cell lines by arresting the cells at the S-phase, and was effective in suppressing the growth on nude mice of solid tumors of human cervical cancer cell line HeLa. Curcumin derivatives had anti-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammatory activity with the same tendency as pol lambda inhibitory activity. These compounds might be useful not only as &quot;molecular probes&quot; for pol research, but also as biomedical and chemotherapeutic drugs for anti-cancer or anti-inflammation."

Biochem.,9205717,2009,"High-performance liquid chromatographic purification of oligomeric procyanidins, trimers up to nonamers, derived from the bark of Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril).",Procyanidin oligomers with different degrees of polymerization (up to nonamers) were efficiently purified from the bark of Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril) by using a recently developed chromatographic separation method. Purification relied on a hydrogen bonding interaction between phenolic hydroxyl groups of the procyanidins and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated resin in a packed column. The individual procyanidins were identified by using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and verified by a thiolytic degradation analysis. Our results demonstrate that Jatoba bark contained a large amount of procyanidins from monomer to nonamers or higher polymers composed of only B-type linked units (flavan-3-ol units linked through C-4 to C-8 (or C-6)) of epicatechin (EC) without gallate esters.

Biochem.,9205717,2009,Species-specific glucosylation of DIMBOA in larvae of the rice Armyworm.,"DIMBOA [2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one] is a benzoxazinoid (Bx), part of the chemical defense system of graminaceous plants such as maize, wheat, and rye. When Bombyx mori larvae were fed artificial diets containing DIMBOA, they died in three days. In contrast, Mythimna separata larvae, a serious pest of rice, maize, sorghum, wheat etc., grew well on the same diets. Three kinds of glucosides [1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-beta-glucopyranoside-1,2-carbamate (methoxy glucoside carbamate), 2-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA-2-O-Glc), and 2-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (HMBOA-2-O-Glc)] were identified by LC-MS and NMR analyses from the frass of M. separata that had been fed on a DIMBOA-containing diet. Furthermore, the incubation of DIMBOA with a midgut tissue suspension of M. separata in the presence of UDP-D-glucose generated DIMBOA-2-O-Glc. These findings strongly suggest that glucosylation by UDP-glucosyltransferase(s) was important for detoxification to circumvent the defenses of host plants against M. separata larvae."

We used streptozocin to induce diabetic rats. GSPEs (250 mg/kg of body weight) were administrated to diabetic rats for 24 weeks. Aortic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were determined in anesthetized rats. Serum glycated hemoglobin and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were determined. An electronic microscope was used to observe the changes in aortic ultrastructure. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the receptor of advanced glycation end product (RAGE) protein expression in aortic tissue. GSPEs significantly decreased aortic PWV, blood pressure, and aortic medial thickness (P&lt;0.05), and inhibited the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. GSPEs significantly reduced the AGEs (P&lt;0.05) and the expression of RAGE in aortas of diabetic rats. GSPEs play an important role against diabetic macrovascular complications. This study may provide a new recognition of natural medicine for the treatment of diabetic macrovascular complications."

When approximately 800 yeast strains expressing GFP-tagged proteins were grown to stationary phase, a surprising number of proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and stress response were observed to form punctate cytoplasmic foci. The formation of these discrete physical structures was confirmed by immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry of untagged proteins. The purine biosynthetic enzyme Ade4-GFP formed foci in the absence of adenine, and cycling between punctate and diffuse phenotypes could be controlled by adenine subtraction and addition. Similarly, glutamine synthetase (Gln1-GFP) foci cycled reversibly in the absence and presence of glucose. The structures were neither targeted for vacuolar or autophagosome degradation nor colocalized with P bodies or major organelles. Thus, upon nutrient depletion we observe widespread protein assemblies displaying nutrient-specific formation and dissolution."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Natural colonization and adaptation of a mosquito species in Galapagos and its implications for disease threats to endemic wildlife.,"Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife have been recognized as a major threat to global biodiversity. Endemic species on isolated oceanic islands, such as the Galápagos, are particularly at risk in the face of introduced pathogens and disease vectors. The black salt-marsh mosquito (Aedes taeniorhynchus) is the only mosquito widely distributed across the Galápagos Archipelago. Here we show that this mosquito naturally colonized the Galápagos before the arrival of man, and since then it has evolved to represent a distinct evolutionary unit and has adapted to habitats unusual for its coastal progenitor. We also present evidence that A. taeniorhynchus feeds on reptiles in Galápagos in addition to previously reported mammal and bird hosts, highlighting the important role this mosquito might play as a bridge-vector in the transmission and spread of extant and newly introduced diseases in the Galápagos Islands. These findings are particularly pertinent for West Nile virus, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality in mammals (including humans), birds, and reptiles, and which recently has spread from an introductory focus in New York to much of the North and South American mainland and could soon reach the Galápagos Islands. Unlike Hawaii, there are likely to be no highland refugia free from invading mosquito-borne diseases in Galápagos, suggesting bleak outcomes to possible future pathogen introduction events."
19039327,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Comparative genomic analysis of ten Streptococcus pneumoniae temperate bacteriophages.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that often carries temperate bacteriophages. As part of a program to characterize the genetic makeup of prophages associated with clinical strains and to assess the potential roles that they play in the biology and pathogenesis in their host, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 10 temperate pneumococcal phages. All of the genomes are organized into five major gene clusters: lysogeny, replication, packaging, morphogenesis, and lysis clusters. All of the phage particles observed showed a Siphoviridae morphology. The only genes that are well conserved in all the genomes studied are those involved in the integration and the lysis of the host in addition to two genes, of unknown function, within the replication module. We observed that a high percentage of the open reading frames contained no similarities to any sequences catalogued in public databases; however, genes that were homologous to known phage virulence genes, including the pblB gene of Streptococcus mitis and the vapE gene of Dichelobacter nodosus, were also identified. Interestingly, bioinformatic tools showed the presence of a toxin-antitoxin system in the phage phiSpn_6, and this represents the first time that an addition system in a pneumophage has been identified. Collectively, the temperate pneumophages contain a diverse set of genes with various levels of similarity among them."
19039328,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Contribution of citrulline ureidase to Francisella tularensis strain Schu S4 pathogenesis.,"The citrulline ureidase (CTU) activity has been shown to be associated with highly virulent Francisella tularensis strains, including Schu S4, while it is absent in avirulent or less virulent strains. A definitive role of the ctu gene in virulence and pathogenesis of F. tularensis Schu S4 has not been assessed; thus, an understanding of the significance of this phenotype is long overdue. CTU is a carbon-nitrogen hydrolase encoded by the citrulline ureidase (ctu) gene (FTT0435) on the F. tularensis Schu S4 genome. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the ctu gene in the virulence of category A agent F. tularensis Schu S4 by generating a nonpolar deletion mutant, the Deltactu mutant. The deletion of the ctu gene resulted in loss of CTU activity, which was restored by transcomplementing the ctu gene. The Deltactu mutant did not exhibit any growth defect under acellular growth conditions; however, it was impaired for intramacrophage growth in resting as well as gamma interferon-stimulated macrophages. The Deltactu mutant was further tested for its virulence attributes in a mouse model of respiratory tularemia. Mice infected intranasally with the Deltactu mutant showed significantly reduced bacterial burden in the lungs, liver, and spleen compared to wild-type (WT) Schu S4-infected mice. The reduced bacterial burden in mice infected with the Deltactu mutant was also associated with significantly lower histopathological scores in the lungs. Mice infected with the Deltactu mutant succumbed to infection, but they survived longer and showed significantly extended median time to death compared to that shown by WT Schu S4-infected mice. To conclude, this study demonstrates that ctu contributes to intracellular survival, in vivo growth, and pathogenesis. However, ctu is not an absolute requirement for the virulence of F. tularensis Schu S4 in mice."
19057511,1,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,The StkP/PhpP signaling couple in Streptococcus pneumoniae: cellular organization and physiological characterization.,"In Streptococcus pneumoniae, stkP and phpP, encoding the eukaryotic-type serine-threonine kinase and PP2C phosphatase, respectively, form an operon. PhpP has the features of a so-called &quot;soluble&quot; protein, whereas StkP protein is membrane associated. Here we provide the first genetic and physiological evidence that PhpP and StkP, with antagonist enzymatic activities, constitute a signaling couple. The StkP-PhpP couple signals competence upstream of the competence-specific histidine kinase ComD, receptor for the oligopeptide pheromone &quot;competence stimulating peptide.&quot; We show that PhpP activity is essential in a stkP(+) genetic background, suggesting tight control of StkP activity by PhpP. Proteins PhpP and StkP colocalized to the cell membrane subcellular fraction and likely belong to the same complex, as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation in cellular extracts. Specific coimmunoprecipitation of the N-kinase domain of StkP and PhpP recombinant proteins by PhpP-specific antibodies demonstrates direct interaction between these proteins. Consistently, flow cytometry analysis allowed the determination of the cytoplasmic localization of PhpP and of the N-terminal kinase domain of StkP, in contrast to the periplasmic localization of the StkP C-terminal PASTA (penicillin-binding protein and serine-threonine kinase associated) domain. A signaling route involving interplay between serine, threonine, and histidine phosphorylation is thus described for the first time in this human pathogen."
19060904,1,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,Ragweed pollen-mediated IgE-independent release of biogenic amines from mast cells via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Normal functions of mitochondria are required for physiological dynamics of cells, while their dysfunction contributes to development of various disorders including those of immune system. Here we demonstrate that exposure of mast cells to ragweed pollen extract increases production of H(2)O(2) via mitochondrial respiratory complex III. These mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) enhance secretion of histamine and serotonin from mast cells, but not enzymes such as beta-hexosaminidase, independently from FcvarepsilonRI-generated stimuli. The release of biogenic amines is associated with inhibition of secretory granules' H(+)-ATPase activity, activation of PKC-delta and microtubule-dependent motility, and it is independent from intracellular free Ca(2+) levels. To asses differences from IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation we show that mtROS decrease antigen-triggered beta-hexosaminidase release, while they are synergistic with antigen-induced IL-4 production in sensitized cells. Taken together, these data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction can act independently from adaptive immunity, as well as augments Th2-type responses. Pharmacological maintenance of physiological mitochondrial function could have clinical benefits in prevention and treatment of allergic diseases."

Therefore, it has been postulated that both types of stem cells might be involved in the regeneration of dental hard tissues. Recently, mesenchymal dental pulp stem cells that have odontogenic potential were identified from human dental pulp. However, the existence of epithelial cells has never been reported in human dental pulp. In the present study, we isolated and characterized epithelial cell-like cells from human deciduous dental pulp. They had characteristic epithelial morphology and expressed epithelial markers. Moreover, they expressed epithelial stem cell-related genes such as ABCG2, Bmi-1, DeltaNp63, and p75. Taken together, our findings suggest that epithelial stem cell-like cells might exist in human deciduous dental pulp and might play a role as an epithelial component for the repair or regeneration of teeth."

Previous studies have reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulate mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human airway cells. Moreover, this production was shown to depend on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is increased in COPD patients' serum. In the present study we investigated the signaling pathway mediating LPS-stimulated secretion and activation of MMP-9, and the regulatory effects of this pathway on the production of MUC5AC in the human airway cells NCI-H292. Using specific inhibitors, we found that LPS-stimulated cells secreted and activated MMP-9 via EGFR. Our results also indicate that signaling events downstream of EGFR involved PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1, which mediated the NADPH-generated reactive oxygen species responsible for MMP-9 secretion and activation. Finally, we observed that EGFR/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH/ROS/MMP-9 regulate MUC5AC production in LPS-challenged NCI-H292 cells."

The exact mechanism how the combination of 8-methoxypsoralen plus UV-A irradiation (PUVA) acts is still unclear. We investigated the cell death of activated and non-activated lymphocytes after PUVA treatment as well as the rate of released blebs and their antigen composition. RESULTS: In presence of 8-MOP, UV-A light highly significantly increased the cell death of activated lymphocytes. The same was observed to a lesser extent in non-activated cells. Blebs derived from activated lymphocytes after PUVA treatment showed the highest surface exposition of phosphatidylserine. These blebs also displayed a high exposure of the antigens CD5 and CD8 as well as a low exposure of CD28 and CD86. CONCLUSION: PUVA treatment exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inducing apoptosis and apoptotic cell-derived blebs with immune suppressive surface composition."
19079254,1,Curr. Biol.,9107782,2009,Mechanical forces of fission yeast growth.,"Mechanical properties contribute to the control of cell size, morphogenesis, development, and lifestyle of fungal cells. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoplastic model, in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell-wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we devised femtoliter cylindrical polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 +/- 6.1 N.m(-1). By analyzing the growth of the cells as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 +/- 0.15 MPa and a growth-stalling force of 11 +/- 3 muN. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene, gpd1(+) (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterizes mechanisms of force generation that contribute to fungal invasion into host tissues."

Deregulation of the FGFR2 gene has been identified in a number of cancer sites. Overexpression of the FGFR4 protein has been linked to cutaneous melanoma progression. Previous studies reported associations between genetic variants in the FGFR2 and FGFR4 genes and development of various cancers. METHODS: We evaluated the associations of four genetic variants in the FGFR2 gene highly related to breast cancer risk and the three common tag-SNPs in the FGFR4 gene with skin cancer risk in a nested case-control study of Caucasians within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) among 218 melanoma cases, 285 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases, 300 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases, and 870 controls. RESULTS: We found no evidence for associations between these seven genetic variants and the risks of melanoma and nonmelanocytic skin cancer. CONCLUSION: Given the power of this study, we did not detect any contribution of genetic variants in the FGFR2 or FGFR4 genes to inherited predisposition to skin cancer among Caucasian women."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Thiourea-catalyzed highly enantio- and diastereoselective additions of oxindoles to nitroolefins: application to the formal synthesis of (+)-physostigmine.,"Oxindoles and their indoline derivatives are common structural motifs found in a wide array of natural and biologically active molecules. Most catalytic methods for the asymmetric syntheses of these compounds rely heavily on the use of transition-metal catalysts. In contrast, alternative catalytic procedures involving organocatalysis are scarce. Herein we disclose a conceptually novel organocatalytic approach to the syntheses of these materials using thiourea-catalyzed asymmetric 1,4-additions of oxindole derivatives to nitroolefins as a key step. These addition reactions create up to two stereogenic centers, one of which is a quaternary center. These reactions are broad in scope with respect to both the oxindole and nitroolefin substrates and provide the desired products in good yields with enantioselectivities of up to 99% and diastereoselectivities of up to &gt;20:1. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, (+)-esermethole was synthesized in good overall yield over 3 steps starting from the 1,4-addition product, thereby providing a formal synthesis of (+)-physostigmine."
19098711,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Selective class II HDAC inhibitors impair myogenesis by modulating the stability and activity of HDAC-MEF2 complexes.,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are promising new epi-drugs, but the presence of both class I and class II enzymes in HDAC complexes precludes a detailed elucidation of the individual HDAC functions. By using the class II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, we separated class I- and class II-dependent effects and defined the roles of class II enzymes in muscle differentiation in cultured cells and in vivo. MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation. In vivo MC1568 shows an apparent tissue-selective HDAC inhibition. In skeletal muscle and heart, MC1568 inhibits the activity of HDAC4 and HDAC5 without affecting HDAC3 activity, thereby leaving MEF2-HDAC complexes in a repressed state. Our results suggest that HDAC class II-selective inhibitors might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscle and heart diseases."
19103756,1,Science,404511,2009,"RIP3, an energy metabolism regulator that switches TNF-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis.","Necrosis can be induced by stimulating death receptors with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or other agonists; however, the underlying mechanism differentiating necrosis from apoptosis is largely unknown. We identified the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) as a molecular switch between TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis in NIH 3T3 cells and found that RIP3 was required for necrosis in other cells. RIP3 did not affect RIP1-mediated apoptosis but was required for RIP1-mediated necrosis and the enhancement of necrosis by the caspase inhibitor zVAD. By activating key enzymes of metabolic pathways, RIP3 regulates TNF-induced reactive oxygen species production, which partially accounts for RIP3's ability to promote necrosis. Our data suggest that modulation of energy metabolism in response to death stimuli has an important role in the choice between apoptosis and necrosis."
19109893,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Reversing a tree regeneration crisis in an endangered ecoregion.,"Global food demand is growing rapidly. Livestock grazing can provide a valuable source of protein, but conventional grazing is often unsustainable. We studied an 800,000-ha section of a threatened ecoregion in southeastern Australia. Conventional management in the region involves continuous livestock grazing with few rest periods and regular fertilizer application. By using remotely sensed data on tree cover and extensive field data on livestock grazing regimes, soil chemistry, tree diameters, and tree regeneration, we show that the region is facing a tree regeneration crisis. Under conventional management, across the region, millions of hectares of land currently supporting tens of millions of trees will be treeless within decades from now. This would have severe negative ramifications for biodiversity and key ecosystem services, including water infiltration and shade provision for livestock. However, we identified an unexpected win-win solution for tree regeneration and commercial grazing. A relatively new practice in the region is fast-rotational grazing, characterized by prolonged rest periods in between short, intensive grazing events. The probability of regeneration under fast-rotational grazing was up to 4-fold higher than under conventional grazing, and it did not differ significantly from the probability of regeneration in ungrazed areas. In addition, trees were more likely to regenerate where soil nutrient levels were low. These findings suggest that the tree regeneration crisis can be reversed by applying low-input, fast-rotational grazing. New policy settings supporting these practices could signal a turning point for the region, from ecological decline to ecological recovery."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Dynamic histone H3 epigenome marking during the intraerythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Epigenome profiling has led to the paradigm that promoters of active genes are decorated with H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks. To explore the epigenome of Plasmodium falciparum asexual stages, we performed MS analysis of histone modifications and found a general preponderance of H3/H4 acetylation and H3K4me3. ChIP-on-chip profiling of H3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K9ac from asynchronous parasites revealed an extensively euchromatic epigenome with heterochromatin restricted to variant surface antigen gene families (VSA) and a number of genes hitherto unlinked to VSA. Remarkably, the vast majority of the genome shows an unexpected pattern of enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. Analysis of synchronized parasites revealed significant developmental stage specificity of the epigenome. In rings, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are homogenous across the genes marking active and inactive genes equally, whereas in schizonts, they are enriched at the 5' end of active genes. This study reveals an unforeseen and unique plasticity in the use of the epigenetic marks and implies the presence of distinct epigenetic pathways in gene silencing/activation throughout the erythrocytic cycle."
19131967,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Environmental transmission of low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses and its implications for pathogen invasion.,"Understanding the transmission dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in the wild is an important scientific and public health challenge because this system represents both a reservoir for recombination and a source of novel, potentially human-pathogenic strains. The current paradigm locates all important transmission events on the nearly direct fecal/oral bird-to-bird pathway. In this article, on the basis of overlooked evidence, we propose that an environmental virus reservoir gives rise to indirect transmission. This transmission mode could play an important epidemiological role. Using a stochastic model, we demonstrate how neglecting environmentally generated transmission chains could underestimate the explosiveness and duration of AIV epidemics. We show the important pathogen invasion implications of this phenomenon: the nonnegligible probability of outbreak even when direct transmission is absent, the long-term infectivity of locations of prior outbreaks, and the role of environmental heterogeneity in risk."
19135240,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,The magnitude of the light-induced conformational change in different rhodopsins correlates with their ability to activate G proteins.,"Light converts rhodopsin, the prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, into a form capable of activating G proteins. Recent work has shown that the light-activated state of different rhodopsins can possess different molecular properties, especially different abilities to activate G protein. For example, bovine rhodopsin is approximately 20-fold more effective at activating G protein than parapinopsin, a non-visual rhodopsin, although these rhodopsins share relatively high sequence similarity. Here we have investigated possible structural aspects that might underlie this difference. Using a site-directed fluorescence labeling approach, we attached the fluorescent probe bimane to cysteine residues introduced in the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane helices V and VI in both rhodopsins. The fluorescence spectra of these probes as well as their accessibility to aqueous quenching agents changed dramatically upon photoactivation in bovine rhodopsin but only moderately so in parapinopsin. We also compared the relative movement of helices V and VI upon photoactivation of both rhodopsins by introducing a bimane label and the bimane-quenching residue tryptophan into helices VI and V, respectively. Both receptors showed movement in this region upon activation, although the movement appears much greater in bovine rhodopsin than in parapinopsin. Together, these data suggest that a larger conformational change in helices V and VI of bovine rhodopsin explains why it has greater G protein activation ability than other rhodopsins. The different amplitude of the helix movement may also be responsible for functional diversity of G protein-coupled receptors."

The mechanism of repeat instability is not yet defined, but in mice it requires MutSbeta, a complex of MSH2 and MSH3. We showed previously that transcription through a CAG repeat tract induces repeat instability in human cells via a pathway that requires the mismatch repair (MMR) components, MSH2 and MSH3, and the entire transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway [Y. Lin, V. Dion, J.H. Wilson, Transcription promotes contraction of CAG repeat tracts in human cells, Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 13 (2006) 179-180; Y. Lin, J.H. Wilson, Transcription-induced CAG repeat contraction in human cells is mediated in part by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, Mol. Cell Biol. 27 (2007) 6209-6217]. Here, we examine the role of downstream MMR processing components on transcription-induced CAG instability, using our selection assay for repeat contraction. In contrast to knockdowns of MSH2 or MSH3, which reduce repeat contractions, we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of MLH1 or PMS2 increases contraction frequency. Knockdown of DNMT1, which has been identified as an MMR factor in genetic studies, also elevates the frequency of contraction. Simultaneous knockdowns of MLH1 or DNMT1 along with MSH2, XPA, or BRCA1, whose individual knockdowns each decrease CAG contraction, yield intermediate frequencies. In sharp contrast, double knockdown of MLH1 and DNMT1 additively increases the frequency of CAG contraction. These results show that MMR components can alter repeat stability in diverse ways, either enhancing or suppressing CAG contraction, and they provide insight into the influence of MMR components on transcription-induced CAG repeat instability."
19135889,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Acute activation of acid ceramidase affects cytokine-induced cytotoxicity in rat islet beta-cells.,"Ceramidase hydrolyzes ceramide and produces sphingosine as a substrate of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), which transforms sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate. It has been reported that cytokines elicit SPHK activation in rat beta-cells. As a sphingosine provider, ceramidase should also be activated. In our previous work, we showed that the increase in mRNA and protein levels in cytokine-treated INS-1 rat beta-cells resulted in chronic activation of neutral ceramidase. Here we found that acid ceramidase (AC) is activated by cytokines at an early stage via tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, basal AC activity was first detected in INS-1 cells and isolated rat islets, and cytokine-induced cell growth was significantly repressed when AC was pharmacologically inhibited."

Based primarily on monosaccharide linkage analysis, but also on the limited use of linkage-specific glucan hydrolases and solvent fractionation, the walls consist predominantly of (1,3/1,6)-beta-D-glucans, (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucans, galactomannans of (1,2;1,6)-Manp residues and (1,5)-galactofuranosyl [(1,5)-Galf] side chains, rhamnomannans of (1,6)-Manp residues and rhamnopyranosyl [(1,2)-Rhap] side chains, and chitin; the walls also contain approximately 23% (w/w) protein. Electron microscopy shows the presence of distinct inner and outer wall layers. Treatment of wall preparations with guanidine hydrochloride dissolves the outer layer and enables separate analysis of the inner and outer walls. The insoluble, inner wall layer is composed of (1,3/1,6)-beta-D-glucans, galacto- and rhamnomannans, (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucans and chitin, whereas the soluble outer wall material contains a high proportion of rhamnomannan, and smaller proportions of galactomannan, (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan and (1,3/1,6)-beta-D-glucan with only trace levels of chitin. It was confirmed by immunochemical and enzymatic analysis that at least a portion of the (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan component of the inner wall exists as a (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan. The analyses not only provide information that is important for a complete understanding of the interactions between R. secalis and barley, but they also identify potential targets for the development of fungicides or resistant transgenic barley varieties."
19139101,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Morphology and electronic structure of the oxide shell on the surface of iron nanoparticles.,"An iron (Fe) nanoparticle exposed to air at room temperature will be instantly covered by an oxide shell that is typically approximately 3 nm thick. The nature of this native oxide shell, in combination with the underlying Fe(0) core, determines the physical and chemical behavior of the core-shell nanoparticle. One of the challenges of characterizing core-shell nanoparticles is determining the structure of the oxide shell, that is, whether it is FeO, Fe(3)O(4), gamma-Fe(2)O(3), alpha-Fe(2)O(3), or something else. The results of prior characterization efforts, which have mostly used X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and transmission electron microscopic imaging, have been framed in terms of one of the known Fe-oxide structures, although it is not necessarily true that the thin layer of Fe oxide is a known Fe oxide. In this Article, we probe the structure of the oxide shell on Fe nanoparticles using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) at the oxygen (O) K-edge with a spatial resolution of several nanometers (i.e., less than that of an individual particle). We studied two types of representative particles: small particles that are fully oxidized (no Fe(0) core) and larger core-shell particles that possess an Fe core. We found that O K-edge spectra collected for the oxide shell in nanoparticles show distinct differences from those of known Fe oxides. Typically, the prepeak of the spectra collected on both the core-shell and the fully oxidized particles is weaker than that collected on standard Fe(3)O(4). Given the fact that the origin of this prepeak corresponds to the transition of the O 1s electron to the unoccupied state of O 2p hybridized with Fe 3d, a weak pre-edge peak indicates a combination of the following four factors: a higher degree of occupancy of the Fe 3d orbital; a longer Fe-O bond length; a decreased covalency of the Fe-O bond; and a measure of cation vacancies. These results suggest that the coordination configuration in the oxide shell on Fe nanoparticles is defective as compared to that of their bulk counterparts. Implications of these defective structural characteristics on the properties of core-shell structured iron nanoparticles are discussed."
19153599,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Characterization of the covalent and noncovalent adducts of Agp1 phytochrome assembled with biliverdin and phycocyanobilin by circular dichroism and flash photolysis.,"The functional role of the covalent attachment of the bilin chromophores biliverdin (BV) and phycocyanobilin (PCB) was investigated for phytochrome Agp1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens using circular dichroism (CD) and transient absorption spectroscopy. Covalent and noncovalent adducts with these chromophores were prepared by using wild-type (WT) Agp1 (covalent BV and noncovalent PCB binding), mutant C20A in which the covalent BV binding site is eliminated, and mutant V249C in which the covalent PCB binding site is introduced. While the CD spectra of the P(r) forms of all these photochromic adducts are qualitatively the same, the CD spectrum of the P(fr) form of the covalent PCB adduct is unique in having a positive rotational strength in the Q-band which we assign to the Z-E isomerization of the C-D methine bridge. In the three other adducts, the Q-band CD in the P(fr) state is almost zero, suggesting that upon photoconversion a negative contribution from an out-of-plane rotation of the A ring of the chromophore compensates for the positive contribution from ring D. The contribution from ring A is absent or strongly reduced in the shorter pi-conjugation system of the covalent PCB adduct. The results from CD spectroscopy are consistent with a uniform geometry of the bilin chromophore in the covalent and noncovalent adducts. Transient absorption spectroscopy showed that the spectral changes and the kinetics of the P(r) to P(fr) photoconversion are not substantially affected by the covalent attachment of BV and PCB. The kinetics in the BV and PCB adducts mainly differ in the formation of P(fr) that is accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude in the PCB adducts, whereas the sequence of spectral transitions and the associated proton transfer processes are quite similar. We conclude that the P(r) to P(fr) photoconversion in the BV and PCB adducts of Agp1 involves the same relaxation processes and is thus governed by specific protein-cofactor interactions rather than by the chemical structure of the chromophore or the mode of attachment. The strongly reduced photostability of the noncovalent BV adduct suggests that covalent attachment in native Agp1 phytochrome prevents irreversible photobleaching and stabilizes the chromophore. The N-terminal peptide segment including amino acids 2-19 is essential for covalent attachment of the chromophore but dispensable for the spectral and kinetic properties of Agp1."
19153600,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Molecularly imprinted tunable binding sites based on conjugated prosthetic groups and ion-paired cofactors.,"A molecular imprinting technique was applied to the construction of prosthetic group-coupled tunable binding cavities for bisphenol A (BPA). A novel template molecule, with a structure consisting of BPA covalently conjugated with two allyl(4-carboxyphenyl)disulfides through ester bonds (BPA-D), was designed. After copolymerization of BPA-D with styrene and divinylbenzene, the BPA di(4-mercaptobenzoate) moieties were removed by reductive cleavage of the disulfide bonds, resulting in apo-type molecularly imprinted cavities bearing two thiol residues. 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid was introduced into the apo-type cavities as a prosthetic group through a disulfide bond by addition of 4,4'-dithiodibenzoic acid, which transformed the apo-type cavities into holo-type cavities with two carboxylic acid residues for binding BPA. When pyridyl prosthetic groups were introduced instead of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid by using 4,4'-dithiodipyridine, BPA recognition ability was maintained but with improved selectivity. The binding affinity was successfully altered several times by attaching and detaching these prosthetic groups, which showed that the apo-type scaffold could be reused. Furthermore, noncovalent-type ion-paired cofactors could be introduced, when the two thiol groups in the apo-type cavities were oxidized to sulfonic acid groups. When 1,2-diaminoethane (DAE) was added to the oxidized apo-type scaffold as a noncovalent-type cofactor, the binding activity was regulated successively, depending upon the concentrations of DAE added. By using various prosthetic groups and cofactors, the binding properties of the holo-type cavities could be tuned in a similar way to those found in biological systems."
19153604,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus: report of two cases with immunohistochemical and molecular genetic study of KIT and PDGFRA.,"The author reports herein two cases of amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus. Case 1 is an 87-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital because of nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic examination revealed an ulcerated tumor of the distal esophagus, and a biopsy was taken. The biopsy showed malignant polygonal and spindle cells. No melanin pigment was recognized. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for melanosome (HMB45), S100 protein, KIT and Platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA). The patient was treated by chemotherapy and radiation, but died of systemic metastasis 12 mo after the presentation. Case 2 is a 56-year-old man presenting with dysphagia. Endoscopic examination revealed a polypoid tumor in the middle esophagus, and a biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed malignant spindle cells without melanin pigment. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positively labeled for melanosome, S100 protein, KIT and PDGFRA. The patient refused operation, and was treated by palliative chemotherapy and radiation. He died of metastasis 7 mo after the admission. In both cases, molecular genetic analyses of KIT gene (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) and PDGFRA gene (exons 12 and 18) were performed by the PCR direct sequencing method, which showed no mutations of KIT and PDGFRA genes. This is the first report of esophageal malignant melanoma with an examination of the expression of KIT and PDGFRA and the mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA genes."
19153607,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Major complications after radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors: analysis of 255 patients.,"AIM: To investigate the major complications after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of liver tumors and analyze possible risk factors that precipitate these complications. METHODS: From March 2001 to April 2008, 255 patients with liver tumors (205 male, 50 female; age range, 18-89 years; mean age, 56.0 years) who received RFA were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 212 had hepatocellular carcinoma, 39 had metastatic liver tumors and four had cholangiocellular carcinoma. One hundred and forty eight patients had a single tumor, and 107 had multiple tumors. Maximum diameter of the tumors ranged 1.3-20 cm (mean, 5.1 cm). All patients were treated with a cooled-tip perfusion electrode attached to a radiofrequency generator (Radionics, Burlington, MA, USA). RFA was performed via the percutaneous approach (n = 257), laparoscopy (n = 7), or open surgical treatment (n = 86). The major complications related to RFA were recorded. The resultant data were analyzed to determine risk factors associated these complications. RESULTS: Among the 255 patients, 425 liver tumors were treated and 350 RFA sessions were performed. Thirty-seven (10%) major complications were observed which included 13 cases of liver failure, 10 cases of hydrothorax requiring drainage, three cases of tumor seeding, one case of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, one case of intrahepatic abscess, one case of bile duct injury, one case of cardiac arrest, and five cases of hyperglycemia. Seven patients had more than two complications. Liver failure was the most severe complication and was associated with the highest mortality. Eleven patients died due to worsening liver decompensation. Child-Pugh classification (P = 0.001) and choice of approach (P = 0.045) were related to post-treatment liver failure, whereas patient age, tumor size and number were not significant factors precipitating this complication. CONCLUSION: RFA can be accepted as a relatively safe procedure for the treatment of liver tumors. However, attention should be paid to possible complications even though the incidences of these complications are rare. Careful patient selection and the best approach choice (percutaneous, laparoscopy, or laparotomy) will help to minimize the incidence and morbidity rate of complications which occur after RFA."
19153608,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Effective use of FibroTest to generate decision trees in hepatitis C.,"AIM: To assess the usefulness of FibroTest to forecast scores by constructing decision trees in patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: We used the C4.5 classification algorithm to construct decision trees with data from 261 patients with chronic hepatitis C without a liver biopsy. The FibroTest attributes of age, gender, bilirubin, apolipoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha2 macroglobulin, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were used as predictors, and the FibroTest score as the target. For testing, a 10-fold cross validation was used. RESULTS: The overall classification error was 14.9% (accuracy 85.1%). FibroTest's cases with true scores of F0 and F4 were classified with very high accuracy (18/20 for F0, 9/9 for F0-1 and 92/96 for F4) and the largest confusion centered on F3. The algorithm produced a set of compound rules out of the ten classification trees and was used to classify the 261 patients. The rules for the classification of patients in F0 and F4 were effective in more than 75% of the cases in which they were tested. CONCLUSION: The recognition of clinical subgroups should help to enhance our ability to assess differences in fibrosis scores in clinical studies and improve our understanding of fibrosis progression."
19156129,1,Cell Stress Chaperones,9610925,2010,Core temperature correlates with expression of selected stress and immunomodulatory genes in febrile patients with sepsis and noninfectious SIRS.,"Environmental hyperthermia and exercise produce extensive changes in gene expression in human blood cells, but it is unknown whether this also happens during febrile-range hyperthermia. We tested the hypothesis that heat shock protein (HSP) and immunomodulatory stress gene expression correlate with fever in intensive care unit patients. Whole blood messenger RNA was obtained over consecutive days from 100 hospitalized patients suffering from sepsis or noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as defined by conventional criteria. The most abnormal body temperature in the preceding 24 h was recorded for each sample. Expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix U133 chip. ANCOVA followed by correlation analysis was performed on a subset of 278 prospectively identified sequences of interest. Temperature affected expression of 60 sequences, either independently or as a function of clinical diagnosis. Forty-eight of these (representing 38 genes) were affected by temperature only, including several HSPs, transcription factors heat shock factor (HSF)-1 and HSF-4, cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM1/CD54 and JAM3, toll receptors TLR-6 and TLR-7, ribosomal proteins, and a number of molecules involved in inflammatory pathways. Twelve sequences demonstrated temperature-dependent responses that differed significantly between patients with sepsis and noninfectious SIRS: CXCL-13; heat shock proteins DNAJB12 and DNAJC4; the F11 receptor; folate hydrolase 1; HSF-2; HSP 70 proteins HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L; interleukin 8; lipopolysaccharide binding protein; and prostaglandin E synthase. Febrile-range temperatures achieved during sepsis and noninfectious SIRS correlate with detectable changes in stress gene expression in vivo, suggesting that fever can activate HSP gene expression and modify innate immune responses. For some genes, it appears that clinical condition can alter temperature-sensitive gene expression. Collectively, these data underscore the potential importance of body temperature in shaping the immune response to infection and injury."
19158663,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Digit ratio (2Dratio4D) differences between 20 strains of inbred mice.,"The second to fourth digit ratio (2Dratio4D) is sexually differentiated in a variety of species, including humans, rats, birds, and lizards. In humans, this ratio tends to be lower in males than in females. Lower digit ratios are believed to indicate increased prenatal testosterone exposure, and are associated with more masculinized behavior across a range of traits. The story seems more complicated in laboratory mice. We have previously shown that there is no sex difference in the digit ratios of inbred mice, but found behavioral evidence to suggest that higher 2Dratio4D is associated with more masculinized behaviors. Work examining intrauterine position effects show that neighbouring males raise pup digit ratio, suggesting again that higher digit ratios are associated with increased developmental androgens. Other work has suggested that masculinization is associated with lower digit ratios in lab mice. Here, we examine the fore- and hindlimb digit ratios of 20 inbred mouse strains. We find large inter-strain differences, but no sexual dimorphism. Digit ratios also did not correlate with mice behavioral traits. This result calls into question the use of this trait as a broadly applicable indicator for prenatal androgen exposure. We suggest that the inbred mice model presents an opportunity for researchers to investigate the genetic, and gene-environmental influence on the development of digit ratios."
19165144,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"N-Myc regulates expression of pluripotency genes in neuroblastoma including lif, klf2, klf4, and lin28b.","myc genes are best known for causing tumors when overexpressed, but recent studies suggest endogenous myc regulates pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. For example, N-myc is associated with a number of tumors including neuroblastoma, but also plays a central role in the function of normal neural stem and precursor cells (NSC). Both c- and N-myc also enhance the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and are linked to neural tumor stem cells. The mechanisms by which myc regulates normal and neoplastic stem-related functions remain largely open questions. Here from a global, unbiased search for N-Myc bound genes using ChIP-chip assays in neuroblastoma, we found lif as a putative N-Myc bound gene with a number of strong N-Myc binding peaks in the promoter region enriched for E-boxes. Amongst putative N-Myc target genes in expression microarray studies in neuroblastoma we also found lif and three additional important embryonic stem cell (ESC)-related factors that are linked to production of iPSC: klf2, klf4, and lin28b. To examine the regulation of these genes by N-Myc, we measured their expression using neuroblastoma cells that contain a Tet-regulatable N-myc transgene (TET21N) as well as NSC with a nestin-cre driven N-myc knockout. N-myc levels closely correlated with the expression of all of these genes in neuroblastoma and all but lif in NSC. Direct ChIP assays also indicate that N-Myc directly binds the lif promoter. N-Myc regulates trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 in the promoter of lif and possibly in the promoters of several other stem-related genes. Together these findings indicate that N-Myc regulates overlapping stem-related gene expression programs in neuroblastoma and NSC, supporting a novel model by which amplification of the N-myc gene may drive formation of neuroblastoma. They also suggest mechanisms by which Myc proteins more generally contribute to maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of ESC as well as to iPSC formation."
19165148,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,An integrated genetic and cytogenetic map of the cucumber genome.,"The Cucurbitaceae includes important crops such as cucumber, melon, watermelon, squash and pumpkin. However, few genetic and genomic resources are available for plant improvement. Some cucurbit species such as cucumber have a narrow genetic base, which impedes construction of saturated molecular linkage maps. We report herein the development of highly polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers originated from whole genome shotgun sequencing and the subsequent construction of a high-density genetic linkage map. This map includes 995 SSRs in seven linkage groups which spans in total 573 cM, and defines approximately 680 recombination breakpoints with an average of 0.58 cM between two markers. These linkage groups were then assigned to seven corresponding chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH assays also revealed a chromosomal inversion between Cucumis subspecies [C. sativus var. sativus L. and var. hardwickii (R.) Alef], which resulted in marker clustering on the genetic map. A quarter of the mapped markers showed relatively high polymorphism levels among 11 inbred lines of cucumber. Among the 995 markers, 49%, 26% and 22% were conserved in melon, watermelon and pumpkin, respectively. This map will facilitate whole genome sequencing, positional cloning, and molecular breeding in cucumber, and enable the integration of knowledge of gene and trait in cucurbits."
19167329,1,Nature,410462,2009,Attrition of memory CD8 T cells.,"An important role for the immune system is to maintain protective immunological memory to a wide variety of pathogens encountered over one's lifetime, while still leaving the host able to respond to newly encountered pathogens. Vezys et al. make the interesting observation that it is possible to repeatedly immunize mice in ways that allow for development of high numbers of memory CD8 T cells without depleting pre-existing memory cells specific for other pathogens. This study, which offers promise in developing potent vaccination schemes, is seemingly at odds with work published by us in the 1990s showing a loss in CD8 memory cells after a series of infections. In their reply, Vezys et al. mention that we may have misinterpreted our data because we reported the putative loss of memory T cells as per cent rather than total number, but here we represent the data in those studies as total cell number. We show here in Fig. 1 that a series of infections can indeed reduce the total number of memory cells, indicating that vaccination strategies need to consider this issue."
19167333,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,The fungal RNA-binding protein Rrm4 mediates long-distance transport of ubi1 and rho3 mRNAs.,"Cytoskeletal transport promotes polar growth in filamentous fungi. In Ustilago maydis, the RNA-binding protein Rrm4 shuttles along microtubules and is crucial for polarity in infectious filaments. Mutations in the RNA-binding domain cause loss of function. However, it was unclear which RNAs are bound and transported. Here, we applied in vivo RNA binding studies and live imaging to determine the molecular function of Rrm4. This new combination revealed that Rrm4 mediates microtubule-dependent transport of distinct mRNAs encoding, for example, the ubiquitin fusion protein Ubi1 and the small G protein Rho3. These transcripts accumulate in ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) that move bidirectionally along microtubules and co-localise with Rrm4. Importantly, the 3' untranslated region of ubi1 containing a CA-rich binding site functions as zipcode during mRNA transport. Furthermore, motile mRNPs are not formed when the RNA-binding domain of Rrm4 is deleted, although the protein is still shuttling. Thus, Rrm4 constitutes an integral component of the transport machinery. We propose that microtubule-dependent mRNP trafficking is crucial for hyphal growth introducing U. maydis as attractive model for studying mRNA transport in higher eukaryotes."
19167335,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Hypoxia prolongs monocyte/macrophage survival and enhanced glycolysis is associated with their maturation under aerobic conditions.,"In chronic inflammatory lesions macrophages are abundant and adapt to the low oxygen concentrations often present there. In low oxygen some cell types die by apoptosis, as reported for macrophage cell lines, while others survive better as they shift their metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis. It was found here that hypoxia prolongs the survival of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, either in the absence or presence of low CSF-1 (M-CSF) concentrations. Although Akt activity increased in bone marrow-derived macrophages in the low oxygen conditions, the levels of both anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members decreased. Glycolysis was enhanced as judged by increased glucose uptake, glucose transporter expression, lactate dehydrogenase mRNA expression, and lactate secretion. Human monocytes responded similarly to low oxygen, and a number of genes associated with glycolysis were shown by microarray analysis and quantitative PCR to be up-regulated. Interestingly, human monocyte-derived macrophages showed evidence of enhanced glycolysis even under aerobic conditions. It is proposed that certain monocyte/macrophage populations survive better under conditions of low oxygen, thereby contributing to their increased numbers at sites of chronic inflammation and tumors; it is also proposed that as macrophages differentiate from monocytes they begin to adopt a glycolytic metabolism allowing them to adapt readily when exposed to low oxygen conditions."
19174163,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Steel factor enhances supraoptimal antigen-induced IL-6 production from mast cells via activation of protein kinase C-beta.,"Ag-triggered mast cell (MC) activation follows a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Reduced activation in response to supraoptimal Ag concentrations is thought to be due to preferential engagement of inhibitory-acting proteins like SHIP1, Lyn, and protein kinase C (PKC)-delta. We show in this study that short-term prestimulation with Steel factor (SF) prevents supraoptimal Ag inhibition, resulting in synergistic MC degranulation and IL-6 secretion. These events are preceded by synergistic phosphorylation/activation of numerous signaling proteins, e.g., Erk, p38, and LAT. However, these effects of prestimulation with SF appear not to be due to reduced engagement of the attenuator SHIP1. Pharmacological analyses suggest that the activation of conventional PKCs is important for this synergy. Specifically, although we found that the conventional PKC inhibitor, Gö6976, likely has some PKC-independent targets in MCs, it led us to further studies that established SF plus Ag-induced IL-6 secretion was severely impaired in PKC-beta(-/-) MCs, but not PKC-alpha(-/-) MCs. Thus, PKC-beta joins PI3K and Btk as important players in this synergistic MC activation."
19180116,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Dok-4 is a novel negative regulator of T cell activation.,"Dok-4 (downstream of tyrosine kinase-4) is a recently identified member of the Dok family of adaptor proteins, which are characterized by an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing several tyrosines and poly-proline-rich motifs. Two members of the Dok family, Dok-1 and Dok-2, have already been described as negative regulators in T cells. However, the function of Dok-4, which is also expressed in T cells, remains unknown. In this study, we report that Dok-4 is phosphorylated after TCR engagement and shuttled within the cytoplasm of T cells before being recruited to the polarized microtubule organizing center after the formation of the immunological synapse. Loss-of-function experiments using RNA interference constructs show that Dok-4 is a negative regulator of ERK phosphorylation, IL-2 promoter activity, and T cell proliferation. Exogenous expression of wild-type Dok-4 induces a significant activation of Rap1, which is involved in the regulation of ERK. The pleckstrin homology domain of Dok-4 is required both for its cytoplasmic shuttling and relocalization as well as for its inhibitory properties on T cell activation. Thus, Dok-4 represents a novel negative regulator of T cells."
19197339,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Ectodomain shedding of FLT3 ligand is mediated by TNF-alpha converting enzyme.,"FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) has diverse roles in the hematopoietic system, which include stimulating proliferation of hematopoietic precursors and development of NK cells and dendritic cells. FLT3L is initially synthesized as a membrane-bound protein, which must be cleaved to become a soluble growth factor. However, little is known about the enzyme involved in the proteolytic release of FLT3L. In the current study, we show that shedding of FLT3L is metalloprotease-dependent, and that this proteolytic activity was abolished in fibroblasts lacking TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) and could be rescued by reintroducing wild-type TACE in these cells. Moreover, we found that cells derived from the thymus of conditional TACE-deficient mice produce less FLT3L, and that serum FLT3L levels in these TACE mutant mice are significantly lower, both after LPS treatment and in the absence of such a challenge, further corroborating the relevance of TACE as FLT3L sheddase in vivo. Considering the involvements of FLT3 and FLT3L in hematopoietic malignancies and stem cell mobilization, the identification of the enzyme involved in FLT3L shedding may have important clinical implications."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Identification and biochemical characterization of human plasma soluble IL-7R: lower concentrations in HIV-1-infected patients.,"The IL-7R alpha-chain and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)) are both components of IL-7R. Human plasma harbors soluble forms of IL-7R (sIL-7Ralpha and sgamma(c)) that are detected and assayed by Western blotting, showing that the levels of sIL-7Ralpha are higher than the levels of sgamma(c) (47.5 ng/ml and 1.5 ng/ml, respectively). Gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry used to analyze deglycosylated, affinity-purified protein showed that sIL-7Ralpha is generated through differentially spliced mRNA, not by membrane receptor shedding. Plasma sIL-7Ralpha and sgamma(c) are present as heterocomplexes and sgamma(c) was found to be mainly associated with sIL-7Ralpha. The affinities of two IL-7 binding sites (K(d) = 35 +/- 8 pM and K(d) = 3 +/- 1 nM) were similar to that of the membrane receptor, suggesting that the sIL-7Ralpha/sgamma(c) complex retains high affinity for IL-7. sIL-7Ralpha mRNA is constitutively present among peripheral T lymphocytes and is down-modulated in vitro by IL-7. Chronically HIV-1-infected patients (n = 20) showed no significant (p &gt; 0.714) variation in sgamma(c) levels and a significant (p &lt; 0.0014) 2-fold decrease in plasma sIL-7Ralpha levels compared with those in control healthy individuals. Plasma IL-7 and sIL-7Ralpha levels did not show any obvious relationship."
19218396,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,"Regulation of T cell activation by Notch ligand, DLL4, promotes IL-17 production and Rorc activation.","The activation and differentiation of T cells are dependent upon numerous initiating events that are influenced by the immune environment, nature of the Ag, as well as the activation state of APCs. In the present studies we have investigated the role of a specific notch ligand, delta-like 4 (Dll4). In particular, our data have indicated that Dll4 is inducible by pathogen-associated signals through TLR activation on dendritic cells but not early response inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-18 that also activate cells via MyD88 adapter pathway. Our observations from in vitro cultures confirmed earlier reports demonstrating that Dll4 inhibits Th2 cytokine production. Furthermore, Dll4 influences the generation of IL-17-producing T cells in the presence of additional skewing cytokines, IL-6 and TGF-beta. In the absence of notch signals, IL-17 production was significantly inhibited even under specific skewing conditions. These studies further demonstrate that Dll4 up-regulates Rorc expression in T cells and that both Rorc and Il17 gene promoters are direct transcriptional notch targets that further enhance the differentiation of Th17 cell populations. Thus, facilitation of efficient T cell differentiation may depend upon the activation of T cells via specific notch ligand stimulation."

The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of glaucoma filtration surgery on retinal vessel oxygen saturation. METHODS: A noninvasive spectrophotometric retinal oximeter was used to measure hemoglobin oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules before and after glaucoma filtration surgery. Twenty-five consecutive patients were recruited, and 19 had adequate image quality. Fourteen underwent trabeculectomy and five glaucoma tube surgery. Twelve had primary open-angle glaucoma and seven had exfoliative glaucoma. IOP decreased from 23 +/- 7 to 10 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, P = 0.0001). RESULTS: Oxygen saturation increased in retinal arterioles from 97% +/- 4% to 99% +/- 6% (n = 19; P = 0.046) after surgery and was unchanged in venules (63% +/- 5% before surgery and 64% +/- 6% after, P = 0.76). There were no significant changes in saturation in the fellow eyes (P &gt; 0.60). The arteriovenous difference was 34% before and 36% after surgery (P = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma filtration surgery had almost no effect on retinal vessel oxygen saturation."
19225519,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha in ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid and its effect on conjunctival fibroblasts.,"PURPOSE: First, to determine whether tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-alpha is expressed in the conjunctiva of ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) and the consequences of systemic immunosuppressive treatment on this expression. Second, to investigate the in vitro effects of TNFalpha on human conjunctival fibroblasts. METHODS: The expression of TNFalpha in conjunctival tissues of patients with actively inflamed ocular MMP (n = 10), patients with clinically noninflamed ocular MMP after systemic immunosuppressive treatment (n = 10), and normal subjects (n = 10) was studied by immunohistochemistry. The effect of TNFalpha on functional assays of human conjunctival fibroblast activity were investigated, including migration, collagen lattice contraction, matrix metalloproteinase (mmp), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (timp) secretion, proliferation, and surface expression of HLA-DR, ICAM, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD40-ligand. RESULTS: In active ocular MMP, TNFalpha is expressed by a large number of stromal infiltrating cells (234 cells/mm(2)), and although the level of stromal TNFalpha expression is significantly reduced after immunosuppressive treatment (90 cells/mm(2)), these levels are still significantly elevated compared with normal conjunctiva (10 cells/mm(2), P &lt; 0.05). TNFalpha stimulates increased migration by conjunctival fibroblasts (P &lt; 0.001), increased production of mmp-9 (P = 0.01), decreased production of timp-2 (P = 0.01) and timp-4 (P = 0.04), and upregulated expression of CD40 and ICAM (P = 0.04). No significant effects of TNFalpha on fibroblast proliferation or collagen lattice contraction were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Increased conjunctival expression of TNFalpha in ocular MMP suggests that systemic TNFalpha antagonists are likely to be effective in controlling severe disease unresponsive to conventional systemic immunosuppression. Residual TNFalpha expression persists in clinically noninflamed disease. TNFalpha appears to have profibrotic and proinflammatory effects on human conjunctival fibroblasts."
19228333,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,"Stimulation of movement in a quiescent, hibernation-like form of Caenorhabditis elegans by dopamine signaling.","One of the characteristics of animals in hibernation is reduced behavioral activity. The Caenorhabditis elegans dauer state is a hibernation-like state of diapause that displays a dramatic reduction in spontaneous locomotion. A similar dauer-like quiescent state is produced in adults by relatively strong mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor homolog daf-2. In this study, we show that mutations affecting the neurotransmitter dopamine, which regulates voluntary movement in many organisms, can stimulate movement in dauers and dauer-like quiescent adults. Surprisingly, the movement of quiescent animals is stimulated by conditions that reduce dopamine signaling and also by conditions predicted to increase dopamine signaling. Reducing dopamine signaling is likely to stimulate movement by activating a foraging response also seen in nondauers after withdrawal of food. In contrast, the stimulation of movement by increased dopamine is much more pronounced in quiescent daf-2(-) dauer and dauer-like adult animals than in nondauaer animals. This altered response to dopamine is primarily attributable to activity of the FOXO (forkhead box O) transcription factor DAF-16 in neurons. We suggest that dauers and dauer-like quiescent adults may have underlying changes in the dopamine system that enable them to respond differently to environmental stimulation."
19233177,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Lateral intraparietal cortex and reinforcement learning during a mixed-strategy game.,"Activity of the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) displays a mixture of sensory, motor, and memory signals. Moreover, they often encode signals reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence that certain eye movements might lead to a desirable outcome. However, when the environment changes dynamically, animals are also required to combine the information about its previously chosen actions and their outcomes appropriately to update continually the desirabilities of alternative actions. Here, we investigated whether LIP neurons encoded signals necessary to update an animal's decision-making strategies adaptively during a computer-simulated matching-pennies game. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, we estimated the value functions that best predicted the animal's choices on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that, immediately before the animal revealed its choice, approximately 18% of LIP neurons changed their activity according to the difference in the value functions for the two targets. In addition, a somewhat higher fraction of LIP neurons displayed signals related to the sum of the value functions, which might correspond to the state value function or an average rate of reward used as a reference point. Similar to the neurons in the prefrontal cortex, many LIP neurons also encoded the signals related to the animal's previous choices. Thus, the posterior parietal cortex might be a part of the network that provides the substrate for forming appropriate associations between actions and outcomes."
19245811,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Transcriptional control of behavior: engrailed knock-out changes cockroach escape trajectories.,"The cerci of the cockroach are covered with identified sensory hairs that detect air movements. The sensory neurons that innervate these hairs synapse with giant interneurons in the terminal ganglion that in turn synapse with interneurons and leg motor neurons in thoracic ganglia. This neural circuit mediates the animal's escape behavior. The transcription factor Engrailed (En) is expressed only in the medially born sensory neurons, which suggested that it could work as a positional determinant of sensory neuron identity. Previously, we used double-stranded RNA interference to abolish En expression and found that the axonal arborization and synaptic outputs of an identified En-positive sensory neuron changed so that it came to resemble a nearby En-negative cell, which was itself unaffected. We thus demonstrated directly that En controls synaptic choice, as well as axon projections. Is escape behavior affected as a result of this miswiring? We showed recently that adult cockroaches keep each escape unpredictable by running along one of a set of preferred escape trajectories (ETs) at fixed angles from the direction of the threatening stimulus. The probability of selecting a particular ET is influenced by wind direction. In this present study, we show that early instar juvenile cockroaches also use those same ETs. En knock-out significantly perturbs the animals' perception of posterior wind, altering the choice of ETs to one more appropriate for anterior wind. This is the first time that it has been shown that knock-out of a transcription factor controlling synaptic connectivity can alter the perception of a directional stimulus."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Chronic nicotine blunts hypoxic sensitivity in perinatal rat adrenal chromaffin cells via upregulation of KATP channels: role of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha.,"Fetal nicotine exposure blunts hypoxia-induced catecholamine secretion from neonatal adrenomedullary chromaffin cells (AMCs), providing a link between maternal smoking, abnormal arousal responses, and risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Here, we show that the mechanism is attributable to upregulation of K(ATP) channels via stimulation of alpha7 nicotinic ACh receptors (AChRs). These K(ATP) channels open during hypoxia, thereby suppressing membrane excitability. After in utero exposure to chronic nicotine, neonatal AMCs show a blunted hypoxic sensitivity as determined by inhibition of outward K(+) current, membrane depolarization, rise in cytosolic Ca(2+), and catecholamine secretion. However, hypoxic sensitivity could be unmasked in nicotine-exposed AMCs when glibenclamide, a blocker of K(ATP) channels, was present. Both K(ATP) current density and K(ATP) channel subunit (Kir 6.2) expression were significantly enhanced in nicotine-exposed cells relative to controls. The entire sequence could be reproduced in culture by exposing neonatal rat AMCs or immortalized fetal chromaffin (MAH) cells to nicotine for approximately 1 week, and was prevented by coincubation with selective blockers of alpha7 nicotinic AChRs. Additionally, coincubation with inhibitors of protein kinase C and CaM kinase, but not protein kinase A, prevented the effects of chronic nicotine in vitro. Interestingly, chronic nicotine failed to blunt hypoxia-evoked responses in MAH cells bearing short hairpin knockdown (&gt;90%) of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha), suggesting involvement of the HIF pathway. The therapeutic potential of K(ATP) channel blockers was validated in experiments in which hypoxia-induced neonatal mortality in nicotine-exposed pups was significantly reduced after pretreatment with glibenclamide."
19269369,1,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Lipin is required for efficient breakdown of the nuclear envelope in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double lipid bilayer that separates nucleus and cytoplasm. In metazoa, NE breakdown (NEBD) occurs during prophase and NE reformation around segregated chromatids occurs at anaphase-telophase. We identified Caenorhabditis elegans Lipin homologue (called Lpin-1) as an essential factor with roles in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) organization and NEBD. RNAi-mediated downregulation of Lpin-1 had no effect on timely entry into mitosis or on the early steps of NEBD, but Lpin-1 was required for disassembly of the nuclear lamina during late NEBD. This Lpin-1 requirement appears to be separable from the effect of Lpin-1 on the peripheral ER."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Properties of arsenite efflux permeases (Acr3) from Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Corynebacterium glutamicum.,"Members of the Acr3 family of arsenite permeases confer resistance to trivalent arsenic by extrusion from cells, with members in every phylogenetic domain. In this study bacterial Acr3 homologues from Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Corynebacterium glutamicum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Modification of a single cysteine residue that is conserved in all analyzed Acr3 homologues resulted in loss of transport activity, indicating that it plays a role in Acr3 function. The results of treatment with thiol reagents suggested that the conserved cysteine is located in a hydrophobic region of the permease. A scanning cysteine accessibility method was used to show that Acr3 has 10 transmembrane segments, and the conserved cysteine would be predicted to be in the fourth transmembrane segment."
19290556,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Runx1 is a co-activator with FOXO3 to mediate transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced Bim transcription in hepatic cells.,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates essential cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins has been implicated as mediators of TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that TGFbeta induces the expression of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a member of the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of TGFbeta-mediated Bim expression in two hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apoptosis with TGFbeta, AML-12 and Hep3B. We show that TGFbeta induces Bim protein and mRNA levels, and its expression is sufficient to induce cell death. Gene array results revealed that Runx1, a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, was induced by TGFbeta, and this induction was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TGFbeta specifically induced the expression of Runx1 protein from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent, cap-independent, mRNA transcript, and its overexpression was sufficient to induce hepatocyte apo pto sis. Deletion and mutation analyses of the murine Bim promoter identified a putative forkhead binding element, at position -174 to -168 from the transcription start site, as the mediator of Runx1 induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Runx1 does not bind directly to the identified forkhead binding element but rather binds the transcriptional regulator FOXO3, which occupies this site. Finally, small interfering RNA knockdown of Runx1 or FOXO3 decreased TGFbeta-induced Bim expression. Our results support a mechanism in which TGFbeta stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3, and the two cooperate in the transcriptional induction of Bim."
19293187,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Red fluorescent protein pH biosensor to detect concentrative nucleoside transport.,"Human concentrative nucleoside transporter, hCNT3, mediates Na+/nucleoside and H+/nucleoside co-transport. We describe a new approach to monitor H+/uridine co-transport in cultured mammalian cells, using a pH-sensitive monomeric red fluorescent protein variant, mNectarine, whose development and characterization are also reported here. A chimeric protein, mNectarine fused to the N terminus of hCNT3 (mNect.hCNT3), enabled measurement of pH at the intracellular surface of hCNT3. mNectarine fluorescence was monitored in HEK293 cells expressing mNect.hCNT3 or mNect.hCNT3-F563C, an inactive hCNT3 mutant. Free cytosolic mNect, mNect.hCNT3, and the traditional pH-sensitive dye, BCECF, reported cytosolic pH similarly in pH-clamped HEK293 cells. Cells were incubated at the permissive pH for H(+)-coupled nucleoside transport, pH 5.5, under both Na(+)-free and Na(+)-containing conditions. In mNect.hCNT3-expressing cells (but not under negative control conditions) the rate of acidification increased in media containing 0.5 mm uridine, providing the first direct evidence for H(+)-coupled uridine transport. At pH 5.5, there was no significant difference in uridine transport rates (coupled H+ flux) in the presence or absence of Na+ (1.09 +/- 0.11 or 1.18 +/- 0.32 mm min(-1), respectively). This suggests that in acidic Na(+)-containing conditions, 1 Na+ and 1 H+ are transported per uridine molecule, while in acidic Na(+)-free conditions, 1 H+ alone is transported/uridine. In acid environments, including renal proximal tubule, H+/nucleoside co-transport may drive nucleoside accumulation by hCNT3. Fusion of mNect to hCNT3 provided a simple, self-referencing, and effective way to monitor nucleoside transport, suggesting an approach that may have applications in assays of transport activity of other H(+)-coupled transport proteins."
19303846,1,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Chromatin-dependent transcription factor accessibility rather than nucleosome remodeling predominates during global transcriptional restructuring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Several well-studied promoters in yeast lose nucleosomes upon transcriptional activation and gain them upon repression, an observation that has prompted the model that transcriptional activation and repression requires nucleosome remodeling of regulated promoters. We have examined global nucleosome positioning before and after glucose-induced transcriptional reprogramming, a condition under which more than half of all yeast genes significantly change expression. The majority of induced and repressed genes exhibit no change in promoter nucleosome arrangement, although promoters that do undergo nucleosome remodeling tend to contain a TATA box. Rather, we found multiple examples where the pre-existing accessibility of putative transcription factor binding sites before glucose addition determined whether the corresponding gene would change expression in response to glucose addition. These results suggest that selection of appropriate transcription factor binding sites may be dictated to a large extent by nucleosome prepositioning but that regulation of expression through these sites is dictated not by nucleosome repositioning but by changes in transcription factor activity."
19303847,1,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Cisternal organization of the endoplasmic reticulum during mitosis.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of animal cells is a single, dynamic, and continuous membrane network of interconnected cisternae and tubules spread out throughout the cytosol in direct contact with the nuclear envelope. During mitosis, the nuclear envelope undergoes a major rearrangement, as it rapidly partitions its membrane-bound contents into the ER. It is therefore of great interest to determine whether any major transformation in the architecture of the ER also occurs during cell division. We present structural evidence, from rapid, live-cell, three-dimensional imaging with confirmation from high-resolution electron microscopy tomography of samples preserved by high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution, unambiguously showing that from prometaphase to telophase of mammalian cells, most of the ER is organized as extended cisternae, with a very small fraction remaining organized as tubules. In contrast, during interphase, the ER displays the familiar reticular network of convolved cisternae linked to tubules."
19303851,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,The nucleoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus facilitates spread of persistent infection through stabilization of the keratin network.,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a prototypic arenavirus containing a bisegmented single-stranded RNA genome with an ambisense coding strategy. MX is a noncytolytic LCMV strain with an in vitro host range restricted to only few cell lines. MX LCMV spreads via cell-cell contacts and causes persistent infection with high production of viral nucleoprotein (NP). Using a proteomic approach, we identified keratin 1 (K1), an intermediate filament network component, as a binding partner of the viral NP. The functional significance of this interaction has been examined by chemical disruption of the keratin network, resulting in a reduced spread of MX LCMV in HeLa cells. However, K1 disassembly was considerably lower in MX LCMV-infected cells than in noninfected counterparts, indicating that NP can stabilize the keratin network and thereby support the integrity of cytoskeleton. The presence of NP also resulted in increased formation of desmosomes and stronger cell-cell adhesion. Similar effects were observed in HeLa cells persistently infected with LCMV strain Armstrong. Our findings suggest that the keratin network is important for the intercellular transmission of persistent LCMV infection in epithelial cells and show that the virus can actively facilitate its own intercellular spread through the interaction between the viral NP and K1 and stimulation of cell-cell contacts."
19345186,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Introduction of exogenous epitopes in the variable regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein: effect on viral infectivity and the neutralization phenotype.,"In this study we examined whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is equally susceptible to neutralization by a given antibody when the epitope of this antibody is introduced at different positions within the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). To this end, we introduced two exogenous &quot;epitope tags&quot; at different locations within three major Env regions in two distinct HIV-1 isolates. We examined how the introduction of the exogenous epitopes affects Env expression, Env incorporation into virions, Env fusogenic potential, and viral susceptibility to neutralization. Our data indicate that even within the same Env region, the exact positioning of the epitope impacts the susceptibility of the virus to neutralization by the antibody that binds to that epitope. Our data also indicate that even if the same epitope is introduced in the exact same position on two different Envs, its exposure and, as a result, the neutralization susceptibility of the virus, can be very different. In contrast to the findings of previous studies conducted with HIV-1 isolates other than those used here, but in agreement with results obtained with simian immunodeficiency virus, we observed that tagging of the fourth variable region of Env (V4) did not result in neutralization by the anti-tag antibodies. Our data indicate that epitopes in V4 are not properly exposed within the functional HIV-1 trimeric Env spike, suggesting that V4 may not be a good target for vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies."
19345190,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,"Simian immunodeficiency virus SIVrcm, a unique CCR2-tropic virus, selectively depletes memory CD4+ T cells in pigtailed macaques through expanded coreceptor usage in vivo.","Simian immunodeficiency virus SIVrcm, which naturally infects red-capped mangabeys (RCMs), is the only SIV that uses CCR2 as its main coreceptor due to the high frequency of a CCR5 deletion in RCMs. We investigated the dynamics of SIVrcm infection to identify specific pathogenic mechanisms associated with this major difference in SIV biology. Four pigtailed macaques (PTMs) were infected with SIVrcm, and infection was monitored for over 2 years. The dynamics of in vivo SIVrcm replication in PTMs was similar to that of other pathogenic and nonpathogenic lymphotropic SIVs. Plasma viral loads (VLs) peaked at 10(7) to 10(9) SIVrcm RNA copies/ml by day 10 postinoculation (p.i.). A viral set point was established by day 42 p.i. at 10(3) to 10(5) SIVrcm RNA copies/ml and lasted up to day 180 p.i., when plasma VLs decreased below the threshold of detection, with blips of viral replication during the follow-up. Intestinal SIVrcm replication paralleled that of plasma VLs. Up to 80% of the CD4(+) T cells were depleted by day 28 p.i. in the gut. The most significant depletion (&gt;90%) involved memory CD4(+) T cells. Partial CD4(+) T-cell restoration was observed in the intestine at later time points. Effector memory CD4(+) T cells were the least restored. SIVrcm strains isolated from acutely infected PTMs used CCR2 coreceptor, as reported, but expansion of coreceptor usage to CCR4 was also observed. Selective depletion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells is in contrast with predicted in vitro tropism of SIVrcm for macrophages and is probably due to expansion of coreceptor usage. Taken together, these findings emphasize the importance of understanding the selective forces driving viral adaptation to a new host."
19345194,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Investigation of the mechanism by which herpes simplex virus type 1 LAT sequences modulate preferential establishment of latent infection in mouse trigeminal ganglia.,"We previously demonstrated that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) preferentially establishes latent infection in monoclonal antibody (MAb) A5-positive ganglionic neurons and that a 2.8-kb portion of the HSV-1 genome, corresponding to the 5' end of the LAT (latency-associated transcript) coding region, is responsible for this phenotype (38, 65). In the current study we carried out further genetic mapping of this latency phenotype and investigated some of the mechanisms that might be responsible. Studies with the chimeric virus HSV-1 17syn+/LAT2, an HSV-1 virus engineered to express HSV-2 LAT, demonstrated that this virus exhibited an HSV-2 latency phenotype, preferentially establishing latency in MAb KH10-positive neurons. This result is complementary to that previously described for the chimeric virus HSV-2 333/LAT1 and indicate that the HSV-1 latency phenotype can be changed to that of HSV-2 by substitution of a 2.8-kb piece of complementary viral DNA. Sequential studies in which we evaluated the pattern of HSV-1 latent infection of the mouse trigeminal ganglion following ocular inoculation with viruses with deletions of functional thymidine kinase, glycoprotein E, ICP0, and US9 protein demonstrate that preferential establishment of HSV-1 latent infection in A5-positive neurons is not a consequence of (i) differential access of HSV-1 to A5-positive neurons,(ii) differential cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1 to A5-positive neurons, (iii) differential &quot;round-trip&quot; spread of HSV-1 to A5-positive neurons, or (iv) expression of ICP0. Additional mapping studies with the HSV-1 LAT deletion viruses dLAT371, 17DeltaSty, and 17Delta348 indicate that most of the LAT 5' exon is not required for HSV-1 to preferentially establish latent infection in A5-positive neurons."

Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Activation of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway reduces phasic contractions in neonatal rat bladder strips via protein kinase G.,"Nitric oxide (NO), a neurotransmitter in the lower urinary tract, stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and in turn cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) to modulate a number of downstream targets. NO donors reduce bladder hyperactivity in some pathological models but do not affect normal bladder activity in the adult rat. In this study, the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP; 100 microM) decreased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and carbachol-enhanced contractions in neonatal rat bladder strips, which are intrinsically hyperactive. This effect was blocked by inhibition of sGC and mimicked by application of a membrane-permeable cGMP analog (8-bromo-cGMP, 100 microM). Inhibition of PKG prevented or reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-bromo-cGMP. A portion of the SNAP-mediated inhibition was also dependent upon PKG; however, a short-lasting, sGC-dependent inhibitory effect of SNAP was still present after PKG inhibition. Inhibition of NO synthase with L-NAME (100 microM) did not change the amplitude or frequency of contractions. However, inhibition of endogenous phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 with zaprinast (25 microM) reduced the amplitude and frequency of phasic contractions and increased the magnitude of inhibition produced by maximal concentrations of SNAP, suggesting that endogenous PDEs are constitutively active and regulate cGMP production. These results suggest that the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway may be involved in inhibitory control of the neonatal rat bladder."

Our laboratory previously showed that K deficiency in rats leads to increased abundance in the proximal tubule BBM of the apical Na-P(i) cotransporter NaPi-IIa, but that the activity, diffusion, and clustering of NaPi-IIa could be modulated by the altered lipid composition of the K-deficient BBM (Zajicek HK, Wang H, Puttaparthi K, Halaihel N, Markovich D, Shayman J, Beliveau R, Wilson P, Rogers T, Levi M. Kidney Int 60: 694-704, 2001; Inoue M, Digman MA, Cheng M, Breusegem SY, Halaihel N, Sorribas V, Mantulin WW, Gratton E, Barry NP, Levi M. J Biol Chem 279: 49160-49171, 2004). Here we investigated the role of the renal Na-P(i) cotransporters NaPi-IIc and PiT-2 in K deficiency. Using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR, we found that, in rats and in mice, K deficiency is associated with a dramatic decrease in the NaPi-IIc protein abundance in proximal tubular BBM and in NaPi-IIc mRNA. In addition, we documented the presence of a third Na-coupled P(i) transporter in the renal BBM, PiT-2, whose abundance is also decreased by dietary K deficiency in rats and in mice. Finally, electron microscopy showed subcellular redistribution of NaPi-IIc in K deficiency: in control rats, NaPi-IIc immunolabel was primarily in BBM microvilli, whereas, in K-deficient rats, NaPi-IIc BBM label was reduced, and immunolabel was prevalent in cytoplasmic vesicles. In summary, our results demonstrate that decreases in BBM abundance of the phosphate transporter NaPi-IIc and also PiT-2 might contribute to the phosphaturia of dietary K deficiency, and that the three renal BBM phosphate transporters characterized so far can be differentially regulated by dietary perturbations."
19407143,1,BMC Struct. Biol.,101088689,2009,Modelling substrate specificity and enantioselectivity for lipases and esterases by substrate-imprinted docking.,"BACKGROUND: Previously, ways to adapt docking programs that were developed for modelling inhibitor-receptor interaction have been explored. Two main issues were discussed. First, when trying to model catalysis a reaction intermediate of the substrate is expected to provide more valid information than the ground state of the substrate. Second, the incorporation of protein flexibility is essential for reliable predictions. RESULTS: Here we present a predictive and robust method to model substrate specificity and enantioselectivity of lipases and esterases that uses reaction intermediates and incorporates protein flexibility. Substrate-imprinted docking starts with covalent docking of reaction intermediates, followed by geometry optimisation of the resulting enzyme-substrate complex. After a second round of docking the same substrate into the geometry-optimised structures, productive poses are identified by geometric filter criteria and ranked by their docking scores. Substrate-imprinted docking was applied in order to model (i) enantioselectivity of Candida antarctica lipase B and a W104A mutant, (ii) enantioselectivity and substrate specificity of Candida rugosa lipase and Burkholderia cepacia lipase, and (iii) substrate specificity of an acetyl- and a butyrylcholine esterase toward the substrates acetyl- and butyrylcholine. CONCLUSION: The experimentally observed differences in selectivity and specificity of the enzymes were reproduced with an accuracy of 81%. The method was robust toward small differences in initial structures (different crystallisation conditions or a co-crystallised ligand), although large displacements of catalytic residues often resulted in substrate poses that did not pass the geometric filter criteria."
19410543,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,NADPH oxidase plays a central role in cone cell death in retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a collection of diseases in which rod photoreceptors die from a variety of mutations. After rods die, the level of tissue oxygen in the outer retina becomes elevated and there is progressive oxidative damage to cones that ultimately triggers apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase (Nox) and/or xanthine oxidase serve as critical intermediaries between increased tissue oxygen and the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative damage to cones. Apocynin, a blocker of Nox, but not allopurinol, a blocker of xanthine oxidase, markedly reduced the superoxide radicals visualized by hydroethidine in the outer retina in the retinal degeneration-1 (rd1(+/+)) model of RP. Compared to rd1(+/+) mice treated with vehicle, those treated with apocynin, but not those treated with allopurinol, had significantly less oxidative damage in the retina measured by ELISA for carbonyl adducts. Apocynin-treated, but not allopurinol-treated, rd1(+/+) mice had preservation of cone cell density, increased mRNA levels for m- and s-cone opsin, and increased mean photopic b-wave amplitude. In Q344ter mice, a model of dominant RP in which mutant rhodopsin is expressed, apocynin treatment preserved photopic electroretinogram b-wave amplitude compared to vehicle-treated controls. These data indicate that Nox, but not xanthine oxidase, plays a critical role in generation of the oxidative stress that leads to cone cell death in RP and inhibition of Nox provides a new treatment strategy."
19410544,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors mediate neuromodulatory functions in the CNS.,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a ubiquitous, lipophilic cellular mediator that acts in part by activation of G-protein-coupled receptor. Modulation of S1P signaling is an emerging pharmacotherapeutic target for immunomodulatory drugs. Although multiple S1P receptor types exist in the CNS, little is known about their function. Here, we report that S1P stimulated G-protein activity in the CNS, and results from [(35)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography using the S1P(1)-selective agonist SEW2871 and the S1P(1/3)-selective antagonist VPC44116 show that in several regions a majority of this activity is mediated by S1P(1) receptors. S1P receptor activation inhibited glutamatergic neurotransmission as determined by electrophysiological recordings in cortical neurons in vitro, and this effect was mimicked by SEW2871 and inhibited by VPC44116. Moreover, central administration of S1P produced in vivo effects resembling the actions of cannabinoids, including thermal antinociception, hypothermia, catalepsy and hypolocomotion, but these actions were independent of CB(1) receptors. At least one of the central effects of S1P, thermal antinociception, is also at least partly S1P(1) receptor mediated because it was produced by SEW2871 and attenuated by VPC44116. These results indicate that CNS S1P receptors are part of a physiologically relevant and widespread neuromodulatory system, and that the S1P(1) receptor contributes to S1P-mediated antinociception."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,"Characterization of prion protein-enriched domains, isolated from rat cerebellar granule cells in culture.","The biological functions of prion protein (PrP(C)) and its possible interaction with other specific molecular membrane partners remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to gain information on the molecular environment of PrP(C) by analyzing the lipid and protein composition of a PrP(C)-enriched membrane subfraction, called prion domain, PrD. This domain was obtained by immunoprecipitation of detergent-resistant microdomains (DRM) of rat cerebellar granule cells under conditions designed to preserve lipid-mediated membrane organization. The electrophoretic pattern of PrD, after staining with Coomassie blue, showed the enrichment of some protein bands in comparison with DRM. microLiquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (microLC-ESI-MS)/MS analysis showed that Thy-1 and different types of myosin were strongly enriched in PrD and, in a lesser extent, also OBCAM, LSAMP and tubulin, present altogether in a single band. Experiments using the chemical cross-linker BS(3) suggested the existence of an interaction between PrP(C) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Concerning lipids, the comparison between PrD and DRM showed a similar phospholipid/sphingolipid ratio, a phospholipid/cholesterol ratio doubled, and a strong decrease of plasmenilethanolamine (19.7 +/- 3.5% vs. 38.3 +/- 1.2%). In conclusion, the peculiar lipid composition and in particular the presence of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton regulation and signalling, suggest an important physiological role in neurons of Prion Domain."
19410549,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,Hypothiocyanous acid reactivity with low-molecular-mass and protein thiols: absolute rate constants and assessment of biological relevance.,"MPO (myeloperoxidase) catalyses the oxidation of chloride, bromide and thiocyanate by H(2)O(2) to HOCl (hypochlorous acid), HOBr (hypobromous acid) and HOSCN (hypothiocyanous acid, also know as cyanosulfenic acid) respectively. Specificity constants indicate that thiocyanate, SCN-, is a major substrate for MPO. HOSCN is also a major oxidant generated by other peroxidases including salivary, gastric and eosinophil peroxidases. Whereas HOCl and HOBr are powerful oxidizing agents, HOSCN appears to be a less reactive, but more thiol-specific oxidant. Although it is established that HOSCN selectively targets thiols, absolute kinetic data for the reactions of thiols with HOSCN are absent from the literature. This study shows for the first time that the reactions of HOSCN with low-molecular-mass thiol residues occur with rate constants in the range from 7.3 x 10(3) M(-1).s(-1) (for N-acetyl-cysteine at pH 7.4) to 7.7 x 10(6) M(-1).s(-1) (for 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at pH 6.0). An inverse relationship between the rate of reaction and the pKa of the thiol group was observed. The rates of reaction of HOSCN with thiol-containing proteins were also investigated for four proteins (creatine kinase, BSA, beta-lactoglobulin and beta-L-crystallins). The values obtained for cysteine residues on these proteins are in the range 1 x 10(4)- 7 x 10(4) M(-1).s(-1). These second-order rate constants indicate that HOSCN is a major mediator of thiol oxidation in biological systems exposed to peroxidase/H(2)O(2) systems at (patho)physiological concentrations of halide and SCN- ions, and that HOSCN may play an important role in inflammation-induced oxidative damage."

Here we describe the directed evolution and characterization of recombinant variants of serum paraoxonase PON3 that express in an active and soluble manner in Escherichia coli. These variants were obtained by combining family shuffling and phylogeny-based mutagenesis: the limited diversity of accessible, cloned PON3 genes was complemented by spiking the shuffling reaction with ancestor/consensus mutations, mutations to residues that comprise the consensus or appear in the predicted ancestors of the PON family. We screened the resulting libraries for PON3's lactonase activity while ensuring that the selected variants retained the substrate specificity of wild-type mammalian PON3s. The availability of highly stable, recombinant PON3 that is free of all other serum components enabled us to explore unknown biochemical features of PON3, including its binding to HDL particles, the effect of HDL on PON3's stability and enzymatic activity, and ex vivo tests of its anti-atherogenic properties. Overall, it appears that PON3 possesses properties very similar to those of PON1: the enzyme's lactonase activity is selectively stimulated by binding to apoAI-HDL, with a concomitant increase in its stability. PON3 also exhibits potentially anti-atherogenic functions, although at levels lower than those of PON1."

Chem.,9716531,2009,Vibriobactin antibodies: a vaccine strategy.,"A new target strategy in the development of bacterial vaccines, the induction of antibodies to microbial outer membrane ferrisiderophore complexes, is explored. A vibriobactin (VIB) analogue, with a thiol tether, 1-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-5,9-bis[[(4S,5R)-2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxazolyl]carbonyl]-14-(3-mercaptopropanoyl)-1,5,9,14-tetraazatetradecane, was synthesized and linked to ovalbumin (OVA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The antigenicity of the VIB microbial iron chelator conjugates and their iron complexes was evaluated. When mice were immunized with the resulting OVA-VIB conjugate, a selective and unequivocal antigenic response to the VIB hapten was observed; IgG monoclonal antibodies specific to the vibriobactin fragment of the BSA and OVA conjugates were isolated. The results are consistent with the idea that the isolated adducts of siderophores covalently linked to their bacterial outer membrane receptors represent a credible target for vaccine development."

Amino alcohol-based parathyroid hormone secretagogues.,"Functional screening of the former SmithKline Beecham compound collection against the human calcium receptor (CaR) resulted in the identification of the amino alcohol-based hit 2 (IC(50) = 11 microM). Structure-activity studies of 2 focused on the optimization of the right- and left-hand side aromatic moieties as well as the amino alcohol linker region. Critical to the optimization of this antagonist template was the discovery that the chirality of the C-2 secondary alcohol played a key role in enhancing both CaR potency as well as selectivity over the beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. These SAR studies ultimately led to the identification of 38 (NPS 2143; SB-262470A), a potent and orally active CaR antagonist. Pharmacokinetic characterization of 38 in the rat revealed that this molecule had a large volume of distribution (11 L/kg), which resulted in a prolonged systemic exposure, protracted increases in the plasma levels of PTH, and an overall lack of net bone formation effect in a rodent model of osteoporosis."

19414022,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,FTIR evidence that the PsbP extrinsic protein induces protein conformational changes around the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II.,"Extrinsic proteins of photosystem II (PSII) regulate the oxygen-evolving reaction performed at the Mn cluster by controlling the binding properties of the indispensable cofactors Ca(2+) and Cl(-). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not yet understood. We have investigated the structural couplings of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ of higher plants with the Mn cluster using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Light-induced FTIR difference spectra upon the S(1) --&gt; S(2) transition were measured using spinach PSII membranes, and the effects of the selective depletion of extrinsic proteins were examined. Depletion of the PsbP and PsbQ proteins by NaCl washing revealed clear changes in the amide I bands with no appreciable changes in the bands of carboxylate and imidazole groups, whereas the depletion of all three proteins by CaCl(2) washing did not cause further changes. The original amide I features were recovered by reconstitution of the NaCl-washed PSII with PsbP, and the same recovery was observed with (13)C-labeled PsbP. These results indicate that the PsbP protein, but not PsbQ and PsbO, affects the protein conformation around the Mn cluster in the intrinsic proteins without changing the ligand structure. Reconstitution with Delta15-PabP, in which the 15 N-terminal residues were truncated, did not restore the amide I bands, indicating that the interaction of the N-terminal region induces the conformational changes. This observation correlates well with a previous finding that Delta15-PabP did not restore the Ca(2+) and Cl(-) retention ability upon rebinding to PSII [Ifuku, K., et al. (2005) Photosynth. Res. 84, 251-255]. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that protein conformational changes around the Mn cluster induced by PsbP through its N-terminal region affect the binding properties of Ca(2+) and Cl(-) and enhance their retention."
19414563,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Gene-network analysis identifies susceptibility genes related to glycobiology in autism.,"The recent identification of copy-number variation in the human genome has opened up new avenues for the discovery of positional candidate genes underlying complex genetic disorders, especially in the field of psychiatric disease. One major challenge that remains is pinpointing the susceptibility genes in the multitude of disease-associated loci. This challenge may be tackled by reconstruction of functional gene-networks from the genes residing in these loci. We applied this approach to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and identified the copy-number changes in the DNA of 105 ASD patients and 267 healthy individuals with Illumina Humanhap300 Beadchips. Subsequently, we used a human reconstructed gene-network, Prioritizer, to rank candidate genes in the segmental gains and losses in our autism cohort. This analysis highlighted several candidate genes already known to be mutated in cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, including RAI1, BRD1, and LARGE. In addition, the LARGE gene was part of a sub-network of seven genes functioning in glycobiology, present in seven copy-number changes specifically identified in autism patients with limited co-morbidity. Three of these seven copy-number changes were de novo in the patients. In autism patients with a complex phenotype and healthy controls no such sub-network was identified. An independent systematic analysis of 13 published autism susceptibility loci supports the involvement of genes related to glycobiology as we also identified the same or similar genes from those loci. Our findings suggest that the occurrence of genomic gains and losses of genes associated with glycobiology are important contributors to the development of ASD."
19414565,0,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Brain anatomical network and intelligence.,"Intuitively, higher intelligence might be assumed to correspond to more efficient information transfer in the brain, but no direct evidence has been reported from the perspective of brain networks. In this study, we performed extensive analyses to test the hypothesis that individual differences in intelligence are associated with brain structural organization, and in particular that higher scores on intelligence tests are related to greater global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. We constructed binary and weighted brain anatomical networks in each of 79 healthy young adults utilizing diffusion tensor tractography and calculated topological properties of the networks using a graph theoretical method. Based on their IQ test scores, all subjects were divided into general and high intelligence groups and significantly higher global efficiencies were found in the networks of the latter group. Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence."
19414586,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"A sequence and structure based method to predict putative substrates, functions and regulatory networks of endo proteases.","BACKGROUND: Proteases play a central role in cellular homeostasis and are responsible for the spatio-temporal regulation of function. Many putative proteases have been recently identified through genomic approaches, leading to a surge in global profiling attempts to characterize their function. Through such efforts and others it has become evident that many proteases play non-traditional roles. Accordingly, the number and the variety of the substrate repertoire of proteases are expected to be much larger than previously assumed. In line with such global profiling attempts, we present here a method for the prediction of natural substrates of endo proteases (human proteases used as an example) by employing short peptide sequences as specificity determinants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our method incorporates specificity determinants unique to individual enzymes and physiologically relevant dual filters namely, solvent accessible surface area--a parameter dependent on protein three-dimensional structure and subcellular localization. By incorporating such hitherto unused principles in prediction methods, a novel ligand docking strategy to mimic substrate binding at the active site of the enzyme, and GO functions, we identify and perform subjective validation on putative substrates of matriptase and highlight new functions of the enzyme. Using relative solvent accessibility to rank order we show how new protease regulatory networks and enzyme cascades can be created. CONCLUSION: We believe that our physiologically relevant computational approach would be a very useful complementary method in the current day attempts to profile proteases (endo proteases in particular) and their substrates. In addition, by using functional annotations, we have demonstrated how normal and unknown functions of a protease can be envisaged. We have developed a network which can be integrated to create a proteolytic world. This network can in turn be extended to integrate other regulatory networks to build a system wide knowledge of the proteome."
19414590,1,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2009,Regulation of mammary stem/progenitor cells by PTEN/Akt/beta-catenin signaling.,"Recent evidence suggests that many malignancies, including breast cancer, are driven by a cellular subcomponent that displays stem cell-like properties. The protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is inactivated in a wide range of human cancers, an alteration that is associated with a poor prognosis. Because PTEN has been reported to play a role in the maintenance of embryonic and tissue-specific stem cells, we investigated the role of the PTEN/Akt pathway in the regulation of normal and malignant mammary stem/progenitor cell populations. We demonstrate that activation of this pathway, via PTEN knockdown, enriches for normal and malignant human mammary stem/progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of PTEN in normal human mammary epithelial cells enriches for the stem/progenitor cell compartment, generating atypical hyperplastic lesions in humanized NOD/SCID mice. Akt-driven stem/progenitor cell enrichment is mediated by activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through the phosphorylation of GSK3-beta. In contrast to chemotherapy, the Akt inhibitor perifosine is able to target the tumorigenic cell population in breast tumor xenografts. These studies demonstrate an important role for the PTEN/PI3-K/Akt/beta-catenin pathway in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell populations and suggest that agents that inhibit this pathway are able to effectively target tumorigenic breast cancer cells."
19414601,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Novel application of fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence microscopy enables quantitative access to subcellular dynamics in plant cells.,"BACKGROUND: Optical and spectroscopic technologies working at subcellular resolution with quantitative output are required for a deeper understanding of molecular processes and mechanisms in living cells. Such technologies are prerequisite for the realisation of predictive biology at cellular and subcellular level. However, although established in the physical sciences, these techniques are rarely applied to cell biology in the plant sciences. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we present a combined application of one-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy and wavelength-selective fluorescence microscopy to analyse the function of a GFP fusion of the Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 Receptor (BRI1-GFP) with high spatial and temporal resolution in living Arabidopsis cells in their tissue environment. We show a rapid, brassinolide-induced cell wall expansion and a fast BR-regulated change in the BRI1-GFP fluorescence lifetime in the plasmamembrane in vivo. Both cell wall expansion and changes in fluorescence lifetime reflect early BR-induced and BRI1-dependent physiological or signalling processes. Our experiments also show the potential of one-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy for the in vivo monitoring of the biochemical and biophysical subcellular environment using GFP fusion proteins as probes. SIGNIFICANCE: One-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy, combined with wavelength-specific fluorescence microscopy, opens up new frontiers for in vivo dynamic and quantitative analysis of cellular processes at high resolution which are not addressable by pure imaging technologies or transmission electron microscopy."
19414745,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Genetic diversity of staphylocoagulase genes (coa): insight into the evolution of variable chromosomal virulence factors in Staphylococcus aureus.,"BACKGROUND: The production of staphylocoagulase (SC) causing the plasma coagulation is one of the important characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus. Although SCs have been classified into 10 serotypes based on the differences in the antigenicity, genetic bases for their diversities and relatedness to chromosome types are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the nucleotide sequences of 105 SC genes (coa), 59 of which were determined in this study. D1 regions, which contain prothrombin-activating and -binding domains and are presumed to be the binding site of each type-specific antiserum, were classified into twelve clusters having more than 90% nucleotide identities, resulting to create two novel SC types, XI and XII, in addition to extant 10 types. Nine of the twelve SC types were further subdivided into subtypes based on the differences of the D2 or the central regions. The phylogenetical relations of the D1 regions did not correlate exactly with either one of agr types and multilocus sequence types (STs). In addition, genetic analysis showed that recombination events have occurred in and around coa. So far tested, STs of 126 S. aureus strains correspond to the combination of SC type and agr type except for the cases of CC1 and CC8, which contained two and three different SC types, respectively. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the evolution of coa was not monophyletic in the species. Chromosomal recombination had occurred at coa and agr loci, resulting in the carriage of the combinations of allotypically different important virulence determinants in staphylococcal chromosome."
19414746,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Differential role of autophagy in CD4 T cells and macrophages during X4 and R5 HIV-1 infection.,"BACKGROUND: HIV-1 can infect and replicate in both CD4 T cells and macrophages. In these cell types, HIV-1 entry is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, Env) to the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor, principally CCR5 or CXCR4, depending on the viral strain (R5 or X4, respectively). Uninfected CD4 T cells undergo X4 Env-mediated autophagy, leading to their apoptosis, a mechanism now recognized as central to immunodeficiency. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate here that autophagy and cell death are also induced in the uninfected CD4 T cells by HIV-1 R5 Env, while autophagy is inhibited in productively X4 or R5-infected CD4 T cells. In contrast, uninfected macrophages, a preserved cell population during HIV-1 infection, do not undergo X4 or R5 Env-mediated autophagy. Autophagosomes, however, are present in macrophages exposed to infectious HIV-1 particles, independently of coreceptor use. Interestingly, we observed two populations of autophagic cells: one highly autophagic and the other weakly autophagic. Surprisingly, viruses could be detected in the weakly autophagic cells but not in the highly autophagic cells. In addition, we show that the triggering of autophagy in macrophages is necessary for viral replication but addition of Bafilomycin A1, which blocks the final stages of autophagy, strongly increases productive infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a complex, but essential, role in HIV pathology by regulating both viral replication and the fate of the target cells."
19414755,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Dealing with feelings: characterization of trait alexithymia on emotion regulation strategies and cognitive-emotional processing.,"BACKGROUND: Alexithymia, or &quot;no words for feelings&quot;, is a personality trait which is associated with difficulties in emotion recognition and regulation. It is unknown whether this deficit is due primarily to regulation, perception, or mentalizing of emotions. In order to shed light on the core deficit, we tested our subjects on a wide range of emotional tasks. We expected the high alexithymics to underperform on all tasks. METHOD: Two groups of healthy individuals, high and low scoring on the cognitive component of the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire, completed questionnaires of emotion regulation and performed several emotion processing tasks including a micro expression recognition task, recognition of emotional prosody and semantics in spoken sentences, an emotional and identity learning task and a conflicting beliefs and emotions task (emotional mentalizing). RESULTS: The two groups differed on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire and Empathy Quotient. Specifically, the Emotion Regulation Quotient showed that alexithymic individuals used more suppressive and less reappraisal strategies. On the behavioral tasks, as expected, alexithymics performed worse on recognition of micro expressions and emotional mentalizing. Surprisingly, groups did not differ on tasks of emotional semantics and prosody and associative emotional-learning. CONCLUSION: Individuals scoring high on the cognitive component of alexithymia are more prone to suppressive emotion regulation strategies rather than reappraisal strategies. Regarding emotional information processing, alexithymia is associated with reduced performance on measures of early processing as well as higher order mentalizing. However, difficulties in the processing of emotional language were not a core deficit in our alexithymic group."
19414770,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Unc5B interacts with FLRT3 and Rnd1 to modulate cell adhesion in Xenopus embryos.,"The FLRT family of transmembrane proteins has been implicated in the regulation of FGF signalling, neurite outgrowth, homotypic cell sorting and cadherin-mediated adhesion. In an expression screen we identified the Netrin receptors Unc5B and Unc5D as high-affinity FLRT3 interactors. Upon overexpression, Unc5B phenocopies FLRT3 and both proteins synergize in inducing cell deadhesion in Xenopus embryos. Morpholino knock-downs of Unc5B and FLRT3 synergistically affect Xenopus development and induce morphogenetic defects. The small GTPase Rnd1, which transmits FLRT3 deadhesion activity, physically and functionally interacts with Unc5B, and mediates its effect on cell adhesion. The results suggest that FLRT3, Unc5B and Rnd1 proteins interact to modulate cell adhesion in early Xenopus development."

Therefore, we investigated the clinical significance of ID1 mRNA expression in bone marrow and peripheral samples in patients with gastric cancer. Two hundred and eighty-nine bone marrow and 196 peripheral blood samples from gastric cancer patients were collected and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR for ID1. The ID1 protein expression in one bone marrow, three metastatic lymph nodes and three peritoneal disseminated tumours was examined by immunohistochemical methods. In both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples, ID1 mRNA expression in the metastatic group was significantly higher than in any other group (P=0.003, P=0.0001, respectively) and significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination. The cells in bone marrow with metastatic cancer stained strongly with ID1 compared with those of healthy volunteers. The expression of ID1 mRNA in bone marrow and peripheral blood was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination, and therefore constitutes a predictable marker for lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination."
19414779,0,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Serum oestrogen receptor alpha and beta bioactivity are independently associated with breast cancer: a proof of principle study.,"BACKGROUND: Oestrogens play a crucial role in breast carcinogenesis. Earlier studies have analysed the serum levels of endogenous hormones measured by conventional assays. In this study, we analysed the capacity of serum from breast cancer cases and controls to transactivate the oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and beta (ER-beta). METHODS: We used a receptor oestrogen-responsive element (ERE) -- the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter test system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Oestrogen receptor-alpha or ER-beta bioactivity was determined in serum from 182 randomly chosen postmenopausal women with breast cancer and from 188 age-matched controls. RESULTS: High serum ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity were independently associated with the presence of breast cancer. Women whose levels of serum ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity were in the highest quintile among controls had a 7.57-(95% confidence interval (CI): 2.46-23.32; P=0.0004) and a 10.14 (95% CI: 3.19-32.23; P&lt;0.0001)-fold risk for general and oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of serum ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity assays as clinical tools in the management of breast cancer warrants further research. Future studies will dictate whether surrogate markers of ER-alpha and ER-beta bioactivity will provide a means to monitor the efficacy of anti-endocrine, adjuvant and chemopreventive strategies."

We have developed a fusion protein that targets TEM8 and disrupts tumor vasculature by promoting localized thrombosis. Fusion protein specificity and function were evaluated using Western blot analysis, ELISA, and enzymatic assays. A xenograft model of colorectal carcinoma was used to test the efficacy of targeted and control fusion proteins. Mice treated with the gene encoding anti-TEM8/truncated tissue factor exhibited a 53% reduction in tumor volume when compared with the untreated animals (P &lt; 0.0001; n = 10) and achieved a 49% increase in tumor growth delay by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.0367; n = 6). Immunohistochemistry confirmed tumor endothelial expression of TEM8, fusion protein homing to tumor vasculature, decrease in vessel density, and localized areas of thrombosis. These data support the hypothesis that targeting TEM8 can be an effective approach to influence tumor development by disrupting tumor vasculature. [Cancer Res 2009;69(12):5126-32]."
19415658,0,Cell,413066,2009,RhoBTB3: a Rho GTPase-family ATPase required for endosome to Golgi transport.,"Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin-based cytoskeleton; Rab GTPases are key regulators of membrane traffic. We report here that the atypical Rho GTPase family member, RhoBTB3, binds directly to Rab9 GTPase and functions with Rab9 in protein transport from endosomes to the trans Golgi network. Gene replacement experiments show that RhoBTB3 function in cultured cells requires both RhoBTB3's N-terminal, Rho-related domain and C-terminal sequences that are important for Rab9 interaction. Biochemical analysis reveals that RhoBTB3 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rather than GTP. Rab9 binding opens the autoinhibited RhoBTB3 protein to permit maximal ATP hydrolysis. Because RhoBTB3 interacts with TIP47 on membranes, we propose that it may function to release this cargo selection protein from vesicles to permit their efficient docking and fusion at the Golgi."
19415667,0,Cell,413066,2009,Proteasome-mediated turnover of the transcription coactivator NPR1 plays dual roles in regulating plant immunity.,"Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a broad-spectrum plant immune response involving profound transcriptional changes that are regulated by the coactivator NPR1. Nuclear translocation of NPR1 is a critical regulatory step, but how the protein is regulated in the nucleus is unknown. Here, we show that turnover of nuclear NPR1 protein plays an important role in modulating transcription of its target genes. In the absence of pathogen challenge, NPR1 is continuously cleared from the nucleus by the proteasome, which restricts its coactivator activity to prevent untimely activation of SAR. Surprisingly, inducers of SAR promote NPR1 phosphorylation at residues Ser11/Ser15, and then facilitate its recruitment to a Cullin3-based ubiquitin ligase. Turnover of phosphorylated NPR1 is required for full induction of target genes and establishment of SAR. These in vivo data demonstrate dual roles for coactivator turnover in both preventing and stimulating gene transcription to regulate plant immunity."
19415921,0,Cell,413066,2009,A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies multiple synthetic lethal interactions with the Ras oncogene.,"Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase Ras are highly prevalent in cancer, but an understanding of the vulnerabilities of these cancers is lacking. We undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the KRAS oncogene. We discovered a diverse set of proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and the proteasome that, when inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature. Our results suggest a previously underappreciated role for Ras in mitotic progression and demonstrate a pharmacologically tractable pathway for the potential treatment of cancers harboring Ras mutations."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 regulates cell adhesion and synaptic morphology via modulation of N-cadherin expression.,"An increase in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels is closely related to the pathogenesis of major depression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism between this increase and impairment of brain function remains elusive. To better understand TNF-alpha/TNF receptor 1 signaling in the brain, we analyzed the brain distribution and function of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1). Here we show that TRAP1 is broadly expressed in neurons in the mouse brain, including regions that are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depression. We demonstrate that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TRAP1 in a neuronal cell line decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, followed by a reduction of the transcription factor E2F1, resulting in a down-regulation of N-cadherin, and affects the adhesive properties of the cells. In addition, in cultured hippocampal neurons, reduced expression of N-cadherin by TRAP1 knockdown influences the morphology of dendritic spines. We also report a significant association between several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TRAP1 gene and major depression. Our findings indicate that TRAP1 mediates TNF-alpha/TNF receptor 1 signaling to modulate N-cadherin expression and to regulate cell adhesion and synaptic morphology, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of major depression."

Crystal structures of VioC were determined in complexes with the cofactor Fe(II), the substrate L-arginine, the product (2S,3S)-hydroxyarginine and the coproduct succinate at 1.1-1.3 A resolution. The overall structure reveals a beta-helix core fold with two additional helical subdomains that are common to nonheme iron oxygenases of the clavaminic acid synthase-like superfamily. In contrast to other clavaminic acid synthase-like oxygenases, which catalyze the formation of threo diastereomers, VioC produces the erythro diastereomer of Cbeta-hydroxylated L-arginine. This unexpected stereospecificity is caused by conformational control of the bound substrate, which enforces a gauche(-) conformer for chi(1) instead of the trans conformers observed for the asparagine oxygenase AsnO and other members of the clavaminic acid synthase-like superfamily. Additionally, the substrate specificity of VioC was investigated. The side chain of the L-arginine substrate projects outwards from the active site by undergoing interactions mainly with the C-terminal helical subdomain. Accordingly, VioC exerts broadened substrate specificity by accepting the analogs L-homoarginine and L-canavanine for Cbeta-hydroxylation."
19416726,0,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Post-translational modifications of the linker histone variants and their association with cell mechanisms.,"In recent years, a considerable amount of research has been focused on establishing the epigenetic mechanisms associated with DNA and the core histones. This effort is driven by the fact that epigenetics is intimately involved with genomics in a whole range of molecular processes. However, there is now a consensus that the epigenetics of the linker histones are just as important. The result of that consensus is that the post-translational modifications (PTMs) for most of the linker histone variants in human and mouse have now been established by a number of experimental techniques, foremost of which is mass spectrometry (MS). MS was also used by our group to establish the PTMs of the linker histone variants in chicken erythrocytes. Although it is now known which types of PTM occur at particular locations on the linker histone variants, there is still a large gap in the knowledge of how this data relates to function. The focus of this review is an analysis of the PTM data for the linker histones from several species, but with an emphasis on human, mouse, and chicken. Our analysis reveals that certain PTMs can be clearly correlated with specific functions of the linker histones in particular cell types, and that unique PTM patterns exist for different cell types."

Recent findings from cell culture models suggest that protein RPE65 is the retinoid isomerohydrolase that catalyzes the reaction. However, previous attempts to detect the enzymatic activity of purified RPE65 were unsuccessful, and thus its enzymatic function remains controversial. Here, we developed a novel liposome-based assay for isomerohydrolase activity. The results showed that purified recombinant chicken RPE65 had a high affinity for all-trans-retinyl palmitate-containing liposomes and demonstrated a robust isomerohydrolase activity. Furthermore, we found that all-trans-retinyl ester must be incorporated into the phospholipid membrane to serve as a substrate for isomerohydrolase. This assay system using purified RPE65 enabled us to measure kinetic parameters for the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by RPE65. These results provide conclusive evidence that RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase of the visual cycle."
19416832,0,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Crystal structures of open and closed forms of cyclo/maltodextrin-binding protein.,"The crystal structures of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris cyclo/maltodextrin-binding protein (TvuCMBP) complexed with alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD), beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and maltotetraose (G4) have been determined. A common functional conformational change among all solute-binding proteins involves switching from an open form to a closed form, which facilitates transporter binding. Escherichia coli maltodextrin-binding protein (EcoMBP), which is structurally homologous to TvuCMBP, has been determined to adopt the open form when complexed with beta-CD and the closed form when bound to G4. Here, we show that, unlike EcoMBP, TvuCMBP-alpha-CD and TvuCMBP-beta-CD adopt the closed form when complexed, whereas TvuCMBP-G4 adopts the open form. Only two glucose residues are evident in the TvuCMBP-G4 structure, and these bind to the C-domain of TvuCMBP in a manner similar to the way in which maltose binds to the C-domain of EcoMBP. The superposition of TvuCMBP-alpha-CD, TvuCMBP-beta-CD and TvuCMBP-gamma-CD shows that the positions and the orientations of three glucose residues in the cyclodextrin molecules overlay remarkably well. In addition, most of the amino acid residues interacting with these three glucose residues also participate in interactions with the two glucose residues in TvuCMBP-G4, regardless of whether the protein is in the closed or open form. Our results suggest that the mechanisms by which TvuCMBP changes from the open to the closed conformation and maintains the closed form appear to be different from those of EcoMBP, despite the fact that the amino acid residues responsible for the initial binding of the ligands are well conserved between TvuCMBP and EcoMBP."

Addition of divalent metal ions such as Mg(2+) to a tris-HCl buffer solution of GroEL(SP/MC) results in one-dimensional (1D) assembly of GroEL(SP/MC), affording cylindrical hollow fibers with a very large aspect ratio; the longest fiber was approximately 2.5 microm long, corresponding to a 170-mer of GroEL(SP/MC) (MW approximately 1.4 x 10(8)). When such long fibers are mixed with EDTA, they are cut into short-chain oligomers and eventually into monomeric GroEL(SP/MC). Similar to GroEL, GroEL(SP/MC) possesses a large binding affinity toward denatured proteins. When GroEL(SP/MC) undergoes 1D assembly after incubation with a denatured protein, guest-containing cylindrical fibers result."

Intermolecular oxidative addition of a benzene C-H bond was directly observed with [(PONOP)Ir(I)(cyclooctene)][PF(6)] at ambient temperature, resulting in a cationic five-coordinate iridium(III) phenyl hydride product. Protonation of the (PONOP)Ir(I) methyl complex yielded the corresponding iridium(III) methyl hydride cation, a rare five-coordinate, 16-valence electron transition metal alkyl hydride species which was characterized by X-ray diffraction. Kinetic studies of C-H bond coupling and reductive elimination reactions from the five-coordinate complexes have been carried out. Exchange NMR spectroscopy measurements established a barrier of 17.8(4) kcal/mol (22 degrees C) for H-C(aryl) bond coupling in the iridium(III) phenyl hydride cation and of 9.3(4) kcal/mol (-105 degrees C) for the analogous H-C(alkyl) coupling in the iridium(III) methyl hydride cation. The origin of the higher barrier of H-C(aryl) relative to H-C(alkyl) bond coupling is proposed to be influenced by a hindered rotation about the Ir-C(aryl) bond, a result of the sterically demanding PONOP ligand."

The highly convergent and flexible strategy developed employed an enantioselective oxidative biaryl coupling and a double cuprate epoxide opening, allowing the selective syntheses of all the possible stereoisomers in pure form. In addition, this strategy permitted rapid access to a broad range of analogues, including those not accessible from the natural products. These compounds provided a powerful means for evaluation of the perylenequinone structural features necessary to PKC activity. Simpler analogues were discovered with superior PKC inhibitory properties and superior photopotentiation in cancer cell lines relative to the more complex natural products."
19416889,0,J. Am. Chem.

In various tellurides with applications as thermoelectrics and as phase-change materials for data storage, even 22-kHz magic-angle spinning cannot resolve the center- and sidebands broadened by chemical-shift dispersion, which precludes peak identification or quantification. For sideband suppression over the necessary wide spectral range (up to 200 kHz), radio frequency pulse sequences with few, short pulses are required. We have identified Gan's two-dimensional magic-angle-turning (MAT) experiment with five 90 degrees pulses as a promising broadband technique for obtaining spectra without sidebands. We have adapted it to broad spectra and fast magic-angle spinning by accounting for long pulses (comparable to the dwell time in t(1)) and short rotation periods. Spectral distortions are small and residual sidebands negligible even for spectra with signals covering a range of 1.5 gammaB(1), due to a favorable disposition of the narrow ranges containing the signals of interest in the spectral plane. The method is demonstrated on various technologically interesting tellurides with spectra spanning up to 170 kHz, at 22 kHz MAS."

Proteome Res.,101128775,2009,Panorganismal metabolic response modeling of an experimental Echinostoma caproni infection in the mouse.,"Metabolic profiling of host tissues and biofluids during parasitic infections can reveal new biomarker information and aid the elucidation of mechanisms of disease. The multicompartmental metabolic effects of an experimental Echinostoma caproni infection have been characterized in 12 outbred female mice infected orally with 30 E. caproni metacercariae each, using a further 12 uninfected animals as a control group. Mice were killed 36 days postinfection and brain, intestine (colon, ileum, jejeunum), kidney, liver, and spleen were removed. Metabolic profiles of tissue samples were measured using high-resolution magic angle spinning (1)H NMR spectroscopy and biofluids measured by applying conventional (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Spectral data were analyzed via principal component analysis, partial least-squares-derived methods and hierarchical projection analyses. Infection-induced metabolic changes in the tissues were correlated with altered metabolite concentrations in the biofluids (urine, plasma, fecal water) using hierarchical modeling and correlation analyses. Metabolic descriptors of infection were identified in liver, renal cortex, intestinal tissues but not in spleen, brain or renal medulla. The main physiological change observed in the mouse was malabsorption in the small intestine, which was evidenced by decreased levels of various amino acids in the ileum, for example, alanine, taurine, glutamine, and branched chain amino acids. Furthermore, altered gut microbial activity or composition was reflected by increased levels of trimethylamine in the colon. Our modeling approach facilitated in-depth appraisal of the covariation of the metabolic profiles of different biological matrices and found that urine and plasma most closely reflected changes in ileal compartments. In conclusion, an E. caproni infection not only results in direct localized (ileum and jejenum) effects, but also causes remote metabolic changes (colon and several peripheral organs), and therefore describes the panorganismal metabolic response of the infection."
19416906,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Mechanistic investigations of anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzyme: direct Cbeta H-atom abstraction catalyzed by a radical AdoMet enzyme.,"Sulfatases are unique in requiring an essential post-translational modification of a critical active-site cysteinyl or seryl residue to 3-oxoalanine usually called C alpha-formylglycine (FGly). This post-translational modification is catalyzed anaerobically by anaerobic Sulfatase Maturating Enzyme (anSME), a member of the radical AdoMet superfamily. Using a new labeled substrate, we demonstrate that anSME uses a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical to catalyze direct H-atom abstraction from the substrate. We thus established that anSMEs are the first radical AdoMet enzymes catalyzing a post-translational modification involving C(beta) H-atom abstraction from an active site cysteinyl or seryl residue. This mechanistic study allowed us to decipher the first steps of the mechanism of this new radical AdoMet enzyme family."

It is increasingly clear that epithelial and endothelial cells enjoy some of this plasticity, which is easily demonstrated by studying the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Published reports from the literature typically rely on ad hoc criteria for determining EMT events; consequently, there is some uncertainty as to whether the same process occurs under different experimental conditions. As we discuss in this Personal Perspective, we believe that context and various changes in plasticity biomarkers can help identify at least three types of EMT and that using a collection of criteria for EMT increases the likelihood that everyone is studying the same phenomenon - namely, the transition of epithelial and endothelial cells to a motile phenotype."
19417007,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,The short N-terminal domains of STIM1 and STIM2 control the activation kinetics of Orai1 channels.,"STIM1 and STIM2 are dynamic transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensors, coupling directly to activate plasma membrane Orai Ca(2+) entry channels. Despite extensive sequence homology, the STIM proteins are functionally distinct. We reveal that the short variable N-terminal random coil sequences of STIM1 and STIM2 confer profoundly different activation properties. Using Orai1-expressing HEK293 cells, chimeric replacement of the 43-amino-acid STIM1 N terminus with that of STIM2 attenuates Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry and drastically slows store-induced Orai1 channel activation. Conversely, the 55-amino-acid STIM2 terminus substituted within STIM1 strikingly enhances both Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry and constitutive coupling to activate Orai1 channels. Hence, STIM N termini are powerful coupling modifiers, functioning in STIM2 to &quot;brake&quot; the otherwise constitutive activation of Orai1 channels afforded by its high sensitivity to luminal Ca(2+)."

While the queens engage in laying eggs, workers perform all other tasks such as nest building, acquisition and processing of food, and brood care. How do such societies function in a coordinated and efficient manner? What are the rules that individuals follow? How are these rules made and enforced? These questions are of obvious interest to us as fellow social animals but how do we interrogate an insect society and seek answers to these questions? In this article I will describe my research that was designed to seek answers from an insect society to a series of questions of obvious interest to us. I have chosen the Indian paper wasp Ropalidia marginata for this purpose, a species that is abundantly distributed in peninsular India and serves as an excellent model system. An important feature of this species is that queens and workers are morphologically identical and physiologically nearly so. How then does an individual become a queen? How does the queen suppress worker reproduction? How does the queen regulate the nonreproductive activities of the workers? What is the function of aggression shown by different individuals? How and when is the queen's heir decided? I will show how such questions can indeed be investigated and will emphasize the need for a whole range of different techniques of observation and experimentation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Aberrant epithelial morphology and persistent epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in a mouse model of renal carcinoma.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has frequently been implicated in hyperproliferative diseases of renal tubule epithelia. We have shown that the NF2 tumor suppressor Merlin inhibits EGFR internalization and signaling in a cell contact-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite the paucity of recurring mutations in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), homozygous mutation of the NF2 gene is found in approximately 2% of RCC patient samples in the Sanger COSMIC database. To examine the roles of Merlin and EGFR in kidney tumorigenesis, we generated mice with a targeted deletion of Nf2 in the proximal convoluted epithelium using a Villin-Cre transgene. All of these mice developed intratubular neoplasia by 3 months, which progressed to invasive carcinoma by 6-10 months. Kidneys from these mice demonstrated marked hyperproliferation and a concomitant increase in label-retaining putative progenitor cells. Early lumen-filling lesions in this model exhibited hyperactivation of EGFR signaling, altered solubility of adherens junctions components, and loss of epithelial polarity. Renal cortical epithelial cells derived from either early or late lesions were dependent on EGF for in vitro proliferation and were arrested by pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR or re-expression of Nf2. These cells formed malignant tumors upon s.c. injection into immunocompromised mice before in vitro passage. Treatment of Vil-Cre;Nf2(lox/lox) mice with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib halted the proliferation of tumor cells. These studies give added credence to the role of EGFR signaling and perhaps Nf2 deficiency in RCC and describe a rare and valuable mouse model for exploring the molecular basis of this disease."
19418581,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Human Dna2 is a nuclear and mitochondrial DNA maintenance protein.,"Dna2 is a highly conserved helicase/nuclease that in yeast participates in Okazaki fragment processing, DNA repair, and telomere maintenance. Here, we investigated the biological function of human Dna2 (hDna2). Immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation studies demonstrated that hDna2 was present in both the nucleus and the mitochondria. Analysis of mitochondrial hDna2 revealed that it colocalized with a subfraction of DNA-containing mitochondrial nucleoids in unperturbed cells. Upon the expression of disease-associated mutant forms of the mitochondrial Twinkle helicase which induce DNA replication pausing/stalling, hDna2 accumulated within nucleoids. RNA interference-mediated depletion of hDna2 led to a modest decrease in mitochondrial DNA replication intermediates and inefficient repair of damaged mitochondrial DNA. Importantly, hDna2 depletion also resulted in the appearance of aneuploid cells and the formation of internuclear chromatin bridges, indicating that nuclear hDna2 plays a role in genomic DNA stability. Together, our data indicate that hDna2 is similar to its yeast counterpart and is a new addition to the growing list of proteins that participate in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA maintenance."
19418592,0,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,Cholera toxin inhibits IL-12 production and CD8alpha+ dendritic cell differentiation by cAMP-mediated inhibition of IRF8 function.,"Prior studies have demonstrated that cholera toxin (CT) and other cAMP-inducing factors inhibit interleukin (IL)-12 production from monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). We show that CT inhibits Th1 responses in vivo in mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii. This correlated with low serum IL-12 levels and a selective reduction in the numbers of CD8alpha(+) conventional DCs (cDCs) in lymphoid organs. CT inhibited the function of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 8, a transcription factor known to positively regulate IL-12p35 and p40 gene expression, and the differentiation of CD8alpha(+) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that exposure to CT, forskolin, or dibutyryl (db) cAMP blocked LPS and IFN-gamma-induced IRF8 binding to chromatin. Moreover, CT and dbcAMP inhibited the binding of IRF8 to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-like element in the mouse IL-12p40 promoter, likely by blocking the formation of ISRE-binding IRF1-IRF8 heterocomplexes. Furthermore, CT inhibited the differentiation of pDCs from fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. Therefore, because IRF8 is essential for IL-12 production and the differentiation of CD8alpha(+) cDCs and pDCs, these data suggest that CT and other Gs-protein agonists can affect IL-12 production and DC differentiation via a common mechanism involving IRF8."

Bot.,9882906,2009,ABA inhibits germination but not dormancy release in mature imbibed seeds of Lolium rigidum Gaud.,"Dormancy release in imbibed annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) seeds is promoted in the dark but inhibited in the light. The role of abscisic acid (ABA) in inhibition of dormancy release was found to be negligible, compared with its subsequent effect on germination of dormant and non-dormant seeds. Inhibitors of ABA metabolism had the expected effects on seed germination but did not influence ABA concentration, suggesting that they act upon other (unknown) factors regulating dormancy. Although gibberellin (GA) synthesis was required for germination, the influence of exogenous GA on both germination and dormancy release was minor or non-existent. Embryo ABA concentration was the same following treatments to promote (dark stratification) and inhibit (light stratification) dormancy release; exogenous ABA had no effect on this process. However, the sensitivity of dark-stratified seeds to ABA supplied during germination was lower than that of light-stratified seeds. Therefore, although ABA definitely plays a role in the germination of annual ryegrass seeds, it is not the major factor mediating inhibition of dormancy release in imbibed seeds."
19419240,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Nitric oxide induces early viral transcription coincident with increased DNA damage and mutation rates in human papillomavirus-infected cells.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are necessary but insufficient causes of cervical cancers. Other risk factors for cervical cancer (e.g., pregnancy, smoking, infections causing inflammation) can lead to high and sustained nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in the cervix, and high NO levels are related to carcinogenesis through DNA damage and mutation. However, the effects of NO exposure in HPV-infected cells have not been investigated. In this study, we used the NO donor DETA-NO to model NO exposure to cervical epithelium. In cell culture media, 24-hour exposure to 0.25 to 0.5 mmol/L DETA-NO yielded a pathologically relevant NO concentration. Exposure of cells maintaining episomal high-risk HPV genomes to NO increased HPV early transcript levels 2- to 4-fold but did not increase viral DNA replication. Accompanying increased E6 and E7 mRNA levels were significant decreases in p53 and pRb protein levels, lower apoptotic indices, increased DNA double-strand breaks, and higher mutation frequencies when compared with HPV-negative cells. We propose that NO is a molecular cofactor with HPV infection in cervical carcinogenesis, and that modifying local NO cervical concentrations may constitute a strategy whereby HPV-related cancer can be reduced."
19419768,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Promyelocytic leukemia protein is required for gain of function by mutant p53.,"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are the most common genetic events in human cancer. These mutations not only result in a loss of wild-type p53 activity, but can also lead to a gain of new oncogenic properties. Understanding how these gained functions are regulated is in its infancy. In this study, we show that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is an important regulator of mutant p53. We show that PML interacts with mutant p53. Importantly, PML enhances the transcriptional activity of mutant p53. Unexpectedly, PML is required for the proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells bearing mutant p53. Down-regulation of PML expression inhibits the growth of mutant p53-expressing cancer cells, predominantly by promoting cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the tumor suppression function of PML depends on the status of p53. In the context of mutant p53, PML enhances its cancer-promoting activities."
19419964,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,AKR1C isoforms represent a novel cellular target for jasmonates alongside their mitochondrial-mediated effects.,"Members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, particularly the AKR1C subfamily, are emerging as important mediators of the pathology of cancer. Agents that inhibit these enzymes may provide novel agents for either the chemoprevention or treatment of diverse malignancies. Recently, jasmonates, a family of plant stress hormones that bear a structural resemblance to prostaglandins, have been shown to elicit anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJ) are capable of inhibiting all four human AKR1C isoforms. Although JA is the more potent inhibitor of recombinant AKR1C proteins, including the in vitro prostaglandin F synthase activity of AKR1C3, MeJ displayed greater potency in cellular systems that was, at least in part, due to increased cellular uptake of MeJ. Moreover, using the acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG1a, we found that although both jasmonates were able to induce high levels of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent fashion, only MeJ was able to induce high levels of mitochondrial superoxide (MSO), possibly as an epiphenomenon of mitochondrial damage. There was a strong correlation observed between MSO formation at 24 hours and reduced cellularity at day 5. In conclusion, we have identified AKR1C isoforms as a novel target of jasmonates in cancer cells and provide further evidence of the promise of these compounds, or derivatives thereof, as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of cancer."

An unstained yeast sample was adsorbed under a titanium (Ti)-coated silicon nitride (Si3N4) film 90 nm thick. The X-ray signal from the film was detected by an X-ray photodiode (PD) placed below the sample. With an electron beam at 2.6 kV acceleration and 6.75 nA current, the yeast image is obtained using the X-ray PD. The image is created by soft X-rays from the Ti layer. The Ti layer is effective in generating the characteristic 2.7-nm wavelength X-rays by the irradiation of electrons. Furthermore, we investigated the electron trajectory and the generation of the characteristic X-rays within the Ti-coated Si3N4 film by Monte Carlo simulation. Our system can be easily utilized to observe various unstained biological samples of cells, bacteria, and viruses."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which NRP1 carries out such versatile functions are still poorly understood. Here we identified protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme as a novel NRP1 binding protein by our combined purification strategy using epitope-tag immunoprecipitation followed by reverse-phase column chromatography. Further we showed that CK2 binds to the extracellular domain of NRP1 which is also phosphorylated by CK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings of novel molecular interactions and modification of NRP1 may provide a new clue to understand the diverse functions of NRP1."

Commun.,372516,2009,Alpha-helix 1 in the DNA-binding domain of heat shock factor 1 regulates its heat-induced trimerization and DNA-binding.,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) primarily regulates various cellular stress responses. The role of alpha-helix1 (H1) in its DNA-binding domain (DBD) during HSF1 activation remains unknown. Here, HSF1 lacking H1 loses its heat-induced activity, suggesting the importance of the latter. Furthermore, the CD spectra and AMBER prediction show that this H1 deficiency does not change the structure of HSF1 monomer, but does impact its heat-induced trimerization. Point mutation showed that Phe18 in H1 interacts with Tyr60, and that Trp23 interacts with Phe104 by an aromatic-aromatic interaction. Thus, the presence of H1 stabilizes the DBD structure, which facilitates the heat-induced trimerization and DNA-binding of HSF1."
19420258,0,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Energetics of ErbB1 transmembrane domain dimerization in lipid bilayers.,"One of the most extensively studied receptor tyrosine kinases is EGFR/ErbB1. Although our knowledge of the role of the extracellular domains and ligands in ErbB1 activation has increased dramatically based on solved domain structures, the exact mechanism of signal transduction across the membrane remains unknown. The transmembrane domains are expected to play an important role in the dimerization process, but the contribution of ErbB1 TM domain to dimer stability is not known, with published results contradicting one another. We address this controversy by showing that ErbB1 TM domain dimerizes in lipid bilayers and by calculating its contribution to stability as -2.5 kcal/mol. The stability calculations use two different methods based on Förster resonance energy transfer, which give the same result. The ErbB1 TM domain contribution to stability exceeds the change in receptor tyrosine kinases dimerization propensities that can convert normal signaling processes into pathogenic processes, and is thus likely important for biological function."
19420259,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Probing energetics of Abeta fibril elongation by molecular dynamics simulations.,"Using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and an all-atom implicit solvent model, we probed the energetics of Abeta(10-40) fibril growth. The analysis of the interactions between incoming Abeta peptides and the fibril led us to two conclusions. First, considerable variations in fibril binding propensities are observed along the Abeta sequence. The peptides in the fibril and those binding to its edge interact primarily through their N-termini. Therefore, the mutations affecting the Abeta positions 10-23 are expected to have the largest impact on fibril elongation compared with those occurring in the C-terminus and turn. Second, we performed weak perturbations of the binding free energy landscape by scanning partial deletions of side-chain interactions at various Abeta sequence positions. The results imply that strong side-chain interactions--in particular, hydrophobic contacts--impede fibril growth by favoring disordered docking of incoming peptides. Therefore, fibril elongation may be promoted by moderate reduction of Abeta hydrophobicity. The comparison with available experimental data is presented."

In aqueous solution, some beta-peptides self-assemble into nanoscale fibers, aggregates, and liquid crystalline phases. Molecular simulations, at an atomistic level, are used to examine, in a systematic manner, the interactions between distinct beta-peptide molecules. The relationship between side-chain chemistry (and position along the backbone) and, in particular, aggregation behaviors, is assessed by calculating the potential of mean force or dimerization free energy of two peptides in explicit water. The free energy profiles as a function of separation for helical, amphiphilic beta-peptides are consistent with experimental observations, and help explain the origins of aggregate or fiber formation in solution. Close examination of the energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy reveals that, depending on the position of certain side groups along the molecule, the tendency of two peptides to aggregate can be driven by entropy or by energy, respectively. In contrast to findings from previous works that employed a coarse representation of the solvent, it is shown that water-peptide interactions play key roles in the association behavior of beta-peptides."
19420266,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,The QTK loop is essential for the communication between the N-terminal atpase domain and the central cleavage--ligation region in human topoisomerase IIalpha.,"We have characterized a human topoisomerase IIalpha enzyme with a deletion of the conserved QTK loop, which extends from the transducer domain to the ATP-binding pocket in the GHKL domain. The loop has been suggested to play a role for interdomain communication in type II topoisomerases. The mutant enzyme performs only very low levels of strand passage, although it is able to cleave and ligate DNA as well as close the N-terminal clamp. Cleavage is nearly unaffected by ATP and ATP analogues relative to the wild-type enzyme. Although the enzyme is able to close the clamp, the clamp has altered characteristics, allowing trapping of DNA also in the absence of an ATP analogue. The enzyme furthermore retains intrinsic levels of ATPase activity, but the activity is not stimulated by DNA. Our observations demonstrate that the QTK loop is an important player for the interdomain communication in human topoisomerase IIalpha. First, the loop seems to play a role in keeping the N-terminal clamp in an open conformation when no nucleotide is present. Once the nucleotide binds, it facilitates clamp closure, although it is not essential for this event. The QTK loop, in contrast, is essential for the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of human topoisomerase IIalpha."
19420326,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,"Neuroprotective effects of the triterpenoid, CDDO methyl amide, a potent inducer of Nrf2-mediated transcription.","The NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway regulates phase 2 detoxification genes, including a variety of antioxidative enzymes. We tested neuroprotective effects of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-MA, a potent activator of the Nrf2/ARE signaling. CDDO-MA treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in Nrf2 upregulation and translocation from cytosol to nucleus and subsequent activation of ARE pathway genes. CDDO-MA blocked t-butylhydroperoxide-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of ARE genes only in wild type, but not Nrf2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Oral administration of CDDO-MA resulted in significant protection against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, pathological alpha-synuclein accumulation and oxidative damage in mice. Additionally, CDDO-MA treatment in rats produced significant rescue against striatal lesions caused by the neurotoxin 3-NP, and associated increases in the oxidative damage markers malondialdehyde, F(2)-Isoprostanes, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and impaired glutathione homeostasis. Our results indicate that the CDDO-MA renders its neuroprotective effects through its potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and suggest that triterpenoids may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease."
19420334,0,Oncogene,8711562,2009,Degradation of cyclin A is regulated by acetylation.,"Cyclin A accumulates at the onset of S phase, remains high during G(2) and early mitosis and is degraded at prometaphase. Here, we report that the acetyltransferase P/CAF directly interacts with cyclin A that as a consequence becomes acetylated at lysines 54, 68, 95 and 112. Maximal acetylation occurs simultaneously to ubiquitylation at mitosis, indicating importance of acetylation on cyclin A stability. This was further confirmed by the observation that the pseudoacetylated cyclin A mutant can be ubiquitylated whereas the nonacetylatable mutant cannot. The nonacetylatable mutant is more stable than cyclin A WT (cycA WT) and arrests cell cycle at mitosis. Moreover, in cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors cyclin A acetylation increases and its stability decreases, thus supporting the function of acetylation on cyclin A degradation. Although the nonacetylatable mutant cannot be ubiquitylated, it interacts with the proteins needed for its degradation (cdks, Cks, Cdc20, Cdh1 and APC/C). In fact, its association with cdks is increased and its complexes with these kinases display higher activity than control cycA WT-cdk complexes. All these results indicate that cyclin A acetylation at specific lysines is crucial for cyclin A stability and also has a function in the regulation of cycA-cdk activity."
19420337,0,Oncogene,8711562,2009,LKB1 is required for adiponectin-mediated modulation of AMPK-S6K axis and inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.,"Adiponectin is widely known as an adipocytokine with therapeutic potential for its markedly protective function in the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders, metabolic syndrome, systemic insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and more recently carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show that adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that adiponectin treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity as evident by increased phosphorylation of downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and inhibition of p70S6 kinase (S6K). Intriguingly, we discovered that adiponectin treatment increases the expression of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of LKB1 in breast cancer cells further increased adiponectin-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK. Using isogenic LKB1 knockdown cell line pair, we found that LKB1 is required for adiponectin-mediated modulation of AMPK-S6K axis and more importantly, inhibition of adhesion, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Taken together these data present a novel mechanism involving specific upregulation of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 by which adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate the possibility of using adiponectin analogues to inhibit invasion and migration of breast cancer cells."

We report that in Mog-deficient mice (Mog-/-), the autoimmune response by transgenic T cells is redirected to a neuronal cytoskeletal self antigen, neurofilament-M (NF-M). Although components of radically different protein classes, the cross-reacting major histocompatibility complex I-Ab-restricted epitope sequences of MOG35-55 and NF-M18-30 share essential TCR contact positions. This pattern of cross-reaction is not specific to the transgenic TCR but is also commonly seen in MOG35-55-I-Ab-reactive T cells. We propose that in the C57BL/6 mouse, MOG and NF-M response components add up to overcome the general resistance of this strain to experimental induction of autoimmunity. Similar cumulative responses against more than one autoantigen may have a role in spontaneously developing human autoimmune diseases."

19420680,0,Nat. Neurosci.,9809671,2009,Odor quality coding and categorization in human posterior piriform cortex.,"Efficient recognition of odorous objects universally shapes animal behavior and is crucial for survival. To distinguish kin from nonkin, mate from nonmate and food from nonfood, organisms must be able to create meaningful perceptual representations of odor qualities and categories. It is currently unknown where and in what form the brain encodes information about odor quality. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate (pattern-based) techniques, we found that spatially distributed ensemble activity in human posterior piriform cortex (PPC) coincides with perceptual ratings of odor quality, such that odorants with more (or less) similar fMRI patterns were perceived as more (or less) alike. We did not observe these effects in anterior piriform cortex, amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex, indicating that ensemble coding of odor categorical perception is regionally specific for PPC. These findings substantiate theoretical models emphasizing the importance of distributed piriform templates for the perceptual reconstruction of odor object quality."
19420707,0,Nat. Genet.,9216904,2009,Lin28 promotes transformation and is associated with advanced human malignancies.,"Multiple members of the let-7 family of miRNAs are often repressed in human cancers, thereby promoting oncogenesis by derepressing targets such as HMGA2, K-Ras and c-Myc. However, the mechanism by which let-7 miRNAs are coordinately repressed is unclear. The RNA-binding proteins LIN28 and LIN28B block let-7 precursors from being processed to mature miRNAs, suggesting that their overexpression might promote malignancy through repression of let-7. Here we show that LIN28 and LIN28B are overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines (overall frequency approximately 15%), and that overexpression is linked to repression of let-7 family miRNAs and derepression of let-7 targets. LIN28 and LIN28b facilitate cellular transformation in vitro, and overexpression is associated with advanced disease across multiple tumor types. Our work provides a mechanism for the coordinate repression of let-7 miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associates activation of LIN28 and LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis."

Genet.,9208958,2009,"Mitochondrial abnormalities, energy deficit and oxidative stress are features of calpain 3 deficiency in skeletal muscle.","Mutations in the non-lysosomal cysteine protease calpain-3 cause autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy. Pathological mechanisms occurring in this disease have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report both morphological and biochemical evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities in calpain-3 knockout (C3KO) muscles, including irregular ultrastructure and distribution of mitochondria. The morphological abnormalities in C3KO muscles are associated with reduced in vivo mitochondrial ATP production as measured by (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mitochondrial abnormalities in C3KO muscles also correlate with the presence of oxidative stress; increased protein modification by oxygen free radicals and an elevated concentration of the anti-oxidative enzyme Mn-superoxide dismutase were observed in C3KO muscles. Previously we identified a number of mitochondrial proteins involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids as potential substrates for calpain-3. In order to determine if the mitochondrial abnormalities resulted from the loss of direct regulation of mitochondrial proteins by calpain-3, we validated the potential substrates that were identified in previous proteomic studies. This analysis showed that the beta-oxidation enzyme, VLCAD, is cleaved by calpain-3 in vitro, but we were not able to confirm that VLCAD is an in vivo substrate for calpain-3. However, the activity of VLCAD was decreased in C3KO mitochondrial fractions compared with wild type, a finding that likely reflects a general mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, these data suggest that mitochondrial abnormalities leading to oxidative stress and energy deficit are important pathological features of calpainopathy and possibly represent secondary effects of the absence of calpain-3."
19421314,0,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,Vascular endothelial growth factor gene polymorphisms as prognostic markers for ocular manifestations in pseudoxanthoma elasticum.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disorder affecting the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and its clinical picture is highly variable. PXE often leads to severe visual impairment due to the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). CNV in PXE-associated retinopathy is believed to be mediated by the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The objective of the present study was to evaluate a possible impact of variations in the VEGFA gene on ocular manifestations of PXE. For this purpose, we evaluated the distribution of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding region of the VEGFA gene in DNA samples from 163 German patients affected by PXE and in 163 healthy control subjects. Haplotype analysis of SNPs c.-1540A&gt;C, c.-460C&gt;T, c.-152G&gt;A, c.405C&gt;G, c.674C&gt;T, c.1032C&gt;T, c.4618C&gt;T and c.5092C&gt;A revealed that the haplotype CTGGCCCC was associated with PXE (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.33-3.15, P(corrected) = 0.01). Furthermore, five SNPs showed significant association with severe retinopathy. The most significant single SNP association was c.-460C&gt;T (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.01-7.31, P(corrected) = 0.0003). Logistic regression analysis identified the c.-460T and the c.674C alleles as independent risk factors for development of severe retinopathy. Our findings suggest an involvement of VEGF in the pathogenesis of ocular PXE manifestations. VEGF gene polymorphisms might prove useful as prognostic markers for the development of PXE-associated retinopathy and permit earlier therapeutic intervention in order to prevent loss of central vision, one of the most devastating consequences of this disease."
19421318,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Essential role of cofilin-1 in regulating thrombin-induced RelA/p65 nuclear translocation and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression in endothelial cells.,"Activation of RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway and the associated changes in actin cytoskeleton induced by thrombin are crucial for activation of NF-kappaB and expression of its target gene ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. However, the events acting downstream of RhoA/ROCK to mediate these responses remain unclear. Here, we show a central role of cofilin-1, an actin-binding protein that promotes actin depolymerization, in linking RhoA/ROCK pathway to dynamic alterations in actin cytoskeleton that are necessary for activation of NF-kappaB and thereby expression of ICAM-1 in these cells. Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin resulted in Ser(3) phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin and formation of actin stress fibers in a ROCK-dependent manner. RNA interference knockdown of cofilin-1 stabilized the actin filaments and inhibited thrombin- and RhoA-induced NF-kappaB activity. Similarly, constitutively inactive mutant of cofilin-1 (Cof1-S3D), known to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton, inhibited NF-kappaB activity by thrombin. Overexpression of wild type cofilin-1 or constitutively active cofilin-1 mutant (Cof1-S3A), known to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton, also impaired thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activity. Additionally, depletion of cofilin-1 was associated with a marked reduction in ICAM-1 expression induced by thrombin. The effect of cofilin-1 depletion on NF-kappaB activity and ICAM-1 expression occurred downstream of IkappaBalpha degradation and was a result of impaired RelA/p65 nuclear translocation and consequently, RelA/p65 binding to DNA. Together, these data show that cofilin-1 occupies a central position in RhoA-actin pathway mediating nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells."
19422095,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,A role for Arabidopsis PUCHI in floral meristem identity and bract suppression.,"At the onset of flowering, the Arabidopsis thaliana primary inflorescence meristem starts to produce flower meristems on its flank. Determination of floral fate is associated with changes in the growth pattern and expression of meristem identity genes and suppression of a subtending leaf called a bract. Here, we show a role in floral fate determination and bract suppression for the PUCHI gene, an AP2/EREBP family gene that has previously been reported to play roles in lateral root morphogenesis. Mutations in PUCHI cause partial conversion of flowers to inflorescences, indicating that PUCHI is required for flower meristem identity. PUCHI is transiently expressed in the early flower meristem and accelerates meristem bulging while it prevents the growth of the bract primordium. The function of PUCHI in floral fate determination and bract suppression overlaps that of the BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 (BOP1) and BOP2 genes, which encode a pair of redundant regulatory proteins involved in various developmental processes, including leaf morphogenesis and flower patterning. We also show that PUCHI acts together with BOP1 and BOP2 to promote expression of LEAFY and APETALA1, two central regulators of floral meristem identity. Expression patterns of the PUCHI and BOP genes point to a role in spatial control of flower-specific activation of these meristem identity genes."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Heterodimeric geranyl(geranyl)diphosphate synthase from hop (Humulus lupulus) and the evolution of monoterpene biosynthesis.,"Myrcene, which accounts for 30-50% of the essential oil in hop (Humulus lupulus L.) trichomes, derives from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), the common precursor of monoterpenes. Full-length sequences of heterodimeric GPP synthase small subunit (GPPS.SSU, belonging to the SSU I subfamily) and large subunit (LSU) cDNAs were mined from a hop trichome cDNA library. The SSU was inactive, whereas the LSU produced GPP, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate in vitro. Coexpression of both subunits in Escherichia coli yielded a heterodimeric enzyme exhibiting altered ratios of GPP and GGPP synthase activities and greatly enhanced catalytic efficiency. Transcript analysis suggested that the heterodimeric geranyl(geranyl)diphosphate synthase [G(G)PPS] is involved in myrcene biosynthesis in hop trichomes. The critical role of the conserved CxxxC motif (where &quot;x&quot; can be any hydrophobic amino acid residue) in physical interactions between the 2 subunits was demonstrated by using site-directed mutagenesis, and this motif was used in informatic searches to reveal a previously undescribed SSU subfamily (SSU II) present in both angiosperms and gymnosperms. The evolution and physiological roles of SSUs are discussed."

Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Mutations at pipX suppress lethality of PII-deficient mutants of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.,"The P(II) proteins are found in all three domains of life as key integrators of signals reflecting the balance of nitrogen and carbon. Genetic inactivation of P(II) proteins is typically associated with severe growth defects or death. However, the molecular basis of these defects depends on the specific functions of the proteins with which P(II) proteins interact to regulate nitrogen metabolism in different organisms. In Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, where P(II) forms complexes with the NtcA coactivator PipX, attempts to engineer P(II)-deficient strains failed in a wild-type background but were successful in pipX null mutants. Consistent with the idea that P(II) is essential to counteract the activity of PipX, four different spontaneous mutations in the pipX gene were found in cultures in which glnB had been genetically inactivated."

Interferon (IFN)-gamma induces the expression of the socs1 gene in several cell types through several cis elements present in its promoter and their binding proteins. Socs1 expression is induced in the human keratinocytes HaCaT cell line through sequential activation of STAT1 and IRF-1. Comparison of the 5'-upstream sequences of the mouse and human socs1 genes identified conserved binding sites for IRF-1 regulatory elements. Although this response element is able to bind IRF-1 in human cells, no IFN-gamma responsiveness was observed with human socs1 promoter reporter constructs containing this element. In contrast the mouse socs1 promoter was fully responsive. The mouse promoter contains two cis-acting elements which modulate its expression and are recognized by IRF-1 and Sp2. Despite the absence of Sp2 in the 5'-upstream sequence of the human promoter, silencing of Sp2 by RNA interference clearly demonstrated that Sp2 is required for IFN-gamma-induced regulation of socs1 mRNA both in human and mouse."
19422228,0,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Molecular simulation studies of monovalent counterion-mediated interactions in a model RNA kissing loop.,"A kissing loop is a highly stable complex formed by loop-loop base-pairing between two RNA hairpins. This common structural motif is utilized in a wide variety of RNA-mediated processes, including antisense recognition, substrate recognition in riboswitches, and viral replication. Recent work has shown that the Tar-Tar(*) complex, an archetypal kissing loop, can form without Mg(2+), so long as high concentrations of alkali chloride salts are present. Interestingly, the stability of the complex is found to decrease with increasing cation size. In this work, we used molecular simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the origins of the observed counterion specificity. The ionic atmosphere of the Tar-Tar(*) complex was examined in the presence of 800 mm (where m denotes molality) NaCl, KCl, or CsCl. We used spatial free-energy density profiles to analyze differences in counterion accumulation at different spatial extents from the RNA molecule. We found that the lowest free-energy levels, which are situated in the vicinity of the loop-loop interface, can accommodate roughly two counterions, irrespective of counterion type. However, as we moved into higher free-energy levels, which are farther from the loop-loop interface, we observed increased differences in the numbers of accumulated counterions, with this number being largest for Na(+) and smallest for Cs(+). We analyzed the source of these differences and were able to attribute these to two distinct features: The extent of partial dehydration varies based on cation type; the smaller the cation, the greater the degree of dehydration. While smaller ions bind their first-hydration-shell water molecules more tightly than larger ions, they are also able to shed these water molecules for stronger electrostatic interactions with the RNA molecule. Secondly, we observed a distinct asymmetry in the numbers of accumulated cations around each hairpin in the Tar-Tar(*) complex. We were able to ascribe this asymmetry to the presence of a guanine tract in the Tar hairpin, which facilitates partial dehydration of the counterions. However, the smaller ions compensate for this asymmetry by forming a belt around the loop-loop interface in intermediate free-energy levels. As a result, the degree of asymmetry in counterion accumulation around individual hairpins shows an inverse correlation with the experimentally observed cation specificity for the stability of Tar-Tar(*) (i.e., the smaller the asymmetry, the greater the experimentally observed stability). This in turn provides a plausible explanation for why the smaller cations help stabilize the Tar-Tar(*) complex better than the larger cations. These findings suggest that the specific sequence and structural features of the Tar-Tar(*) complex may be the source of the experimentally observed cation specificity in Tar-Tar(*) stability. Our results lead to testable predictions for how changes in sequence might alter the observed counterion specificity in kissing loop stability."

MD1 patients frequently present insulin resistance and increased visceral adiposity. We examined whether DMPK deficiency is a genetic risk factor for high-fat diet-induced adiposity and insulin resistance using the DMPK knockout mouse model. We found that high-fat fed DMPK knockout mice had significantly increased body weights, hypertrophic adipocytes and whole-body insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice. This nutrient-genome interaction should be considered by physicians given the cardiometabolic risks and sedentary lifestyle associated with MD1 patients."

In order to broaden the array of tools for therapeutic application, we isolated a new population of cells from adult human testis termed gonadal stem cells (GSCs). GSCs express CD105, CD166, CD73, CD90, STRO-1 and lack hematopoietic markers CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR which are characteristic identifiers of MSCs. In addition, GSCs express pluripotent markers Oct4, Nanog, and SSEA-4. GSCs propagated for at least 64 population doublings and exhibited clonogenic capability. GSCs have a broad plasticity and the potential to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic cells. These studies demonstrate that GSCs are easily obtainable stem cells, have growth kinetics and marker expression similar to MSCs, and differentiate into mesodermal lineage cells. Therefore, GSCs may be a valuable tool for therapeutic applications."

The PIKK family of protein kinases, which includes ATM/ATR/DNA-PK, preferentially phosphorylate Ser-Gln sites, while their basophilic downstream effecter kinases, Chk1/Chk2/MK2 preferentially phosphorylate hydrophobic-X-Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr-hydrophobic sites. A subset of tandem BRCT domains act as phosphopeptide binding modules that bind to ATM/ATR/DNA-PK substrates after DNA damage. Conversely, 14-3-3 proteins interact with substrates of Chk1/Chk2/MK2. FHA domains have been shown to interact with substrates of ATM/ATR/DNA-PK and CK2. In this review we consider how substrate phosphorylation together with BRCT domains, FHA domains and 14-3-3 proteins function to regulate ionizing radiation-induced nuclear foci and help to establish the G(2)/M checkpoint. We discuss the role of MDC1 a molecular scaffold that recruits early proteins to foci, such as NBS1 and RNF8, through distinct phosphodependent interactions. In addition, we consider the role of 14-3-3 proteins and the Chk2 FHA domain in initiating and maintaining cell cycle arrest."

We investigated the role of genetic factors already associated in adults with HCV infection evolution (HLA-DRB1, MBL2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-10), or liver disease progression (HFE and TGF-beta1). 384 Italian subjects were recruited, including 38 HCV-positive mother/child pairs; 104 infected, non-transmitting mothers with their 114 children; 21 vertically infected children and 69 HCV-exposed, uninfected children. Samples were analysed for previously described gene polymorphisms. Maternal HLA-DRB104 correlated with protection from vertical transmission (p=0.023), while HLA-DRB110 in children was a risk factor (p=0.036). Investigation of concordance degree in HLA-DRB1 locus revealed that a HLA mismatch between mother and child was a protective factor (p=0.017) indicating that alloreactive immune responses are involved in preventing HCV vertical transmission."

In the present study we provide further evidence that severe HTG due to LPL deficiency also promotes an atherothrombotic response to arterial injury induced by ferric chloride in a severe combined hyperlipidemic mouse model. Methods and results: A mouse model (LPL(-/-)XApoE(-/-) double knockout, DKO) with severe combined hyperlipidemia was established by crossing ApoE and LPL-deficient mice. The common carotid arteries of ApoE knockout (EKO) and DKO mice were subjected to injury by ferric chloride, and the formation of arterial thrombosis together with various markers were compared in these lesions. DKO mice demonstrated significantly enhanced thrombus formation overlying atherosclerotic plaque after injury, which contained smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and neutral lipid. The area of neointima, mean intima/media ratios, and the percentage of luminal stenosis were significantly greater (P&lt;0.01) in DKO mice. Compared with EKO mice, the expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were increased in DKO mice. Conclusions: Severe combined hyperlipidemia promotes thrombosis after ferric chloride injury to atherosclerotic vessels and HTG plays a major role in the process."

Cell,9802571,2009,Phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor CYLD by the breast cancer oncogene IKKepsilon promotes cell transformation.,"The noncanonical IKK family member IKKepsilon is essential for regulating antiviral signaling pathways and is a recently discovered breast cancer oncoprotein. Although several IKKepsilon targets have been described, direct IKKepsilon substrates necessary for regulating cell transformation have not been identified. Here, we performed a screen for putative IKKepsilon substrates using an unbiased proteomic and bioinformatic approach. Using a positional scanning peptide library assay, we determined the optimal phosphorylation motif for IKKepsilon and used bioinformatic approaches to predict IKKepsilon substrates. Of these potential substrates, serine 418 of the tumor suppressor CYLD was identified as a likely site of IKKepsilon phosphorylation. We confirmed that CYLD is directly phosphorylated by IKKepsilon and that IKKepsilon phosphorylates serine 418 in vivo. Phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418 decreases its deubiquitinase activity and is necessary for IKKepsilon-driven transformation. Together, these observations define IKKepsilon and CYLD as an oncogene-tumor suppressor network that participates in tumorigenesis."

Cell,9802571,2009,Polo kinase regulates mitotic chromosome condensation by hyperactivation of condensin DNA supercoiling activity.,"A defining feature of mitosis is the reorganization of chromosomes into highly condensed structures capable of withstanding separation and large-scale intracellular movements. This reorganization is promoted by condensin, an evolutionarily conserved multisubunit ATPase. Here we show, using budding yeast, that condensin is regulated by phosphorylation specifically in anaphase. This phosphorylation depends on several mitotic regulators, and the ultimate effector is the Polo kinase Cdc5. We demonstrate that Cdc5 directly phosphorylates all three regulatory subunits of the condensin complex in vivo and that this causes a hyperactivation of condensin DNA supercoiling activity. Strikingly, abrogation of condensin phosphorylation is incompatible with viability, and cells expressing condensin mutants that have a reduced ability to be phosphorylated in vivo are defective in anaphase-specific chromosome condensation. Our results reveal the existence of a regulatory mechanism essential for the promotion of genome integrity through the stimulation of chromosome condensation in late mitosis."

Activation of the yeast HO gene follows the sequential binding of both sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and coactivators during the cell cycle. Here, we show that the nucleosome disassembly occurs in waves both along the length of the promoter and during the cell cycle. Different chromatin modifiers are required for chromatin disassembly at different regions of the promoter, with Swi/Snf, the FACT chromatin reorganizer, and the Asf1 histone chaperone each required for nucleosome eviction at distinct promoter regions. FACT and Asf1 both bind to upstream elements of the HO promoter well before the gene is transcribed. The Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator coactivators bind first to the far upstream promoter region and subsequently to a promoter proximal region, and FACT and Asf1 are both required for this coactivator re-recruitment."

19423702,1,Curr. Biol.,9107782,2009,Direct tactile stimulation of dorsal occipito-temporal cortex in a visual agnosic.,"The human occipito-temporal cortex is preferentially activated by images of objects as opposed to scrambled images. Touching objects (versus textures) also activates this region. We used neuropsychological fMRI to probe whether dorsal regions of the lateral occipital cortex (LO) are activated in tactile recognition without mediation through visual recognition. We tested a patient (HJA) with visual agnosia due to bilateral lesions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex but spared dorsal LO. HJA's recognition of visual objects was impaired. Nevertheless, his tactile recognition was preserved. We measured brain activity while participants viewed and touched objects and textures. There was overlapping activity in regions including LO and cerebellum for both stimuli for control participants, including new regions not before considered bimodal. For HJA, there were overlapping regions in the intact dorsal LO. Within a subset of the regions found in control participants, HJA showed activity only for tactile objects, suggesting that these regions are specifically involved in successful multimodal recognition. Activation of dorsal LO by tactile input is not secondary to visual recognition but can operate directly through tactile input."
19423706,0,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of human DPY-30-like protein: A component of the histone methyltransferase complex.,"The conserved DPY-30 is an essential component of the dosage compensation complex that balances the X-linked gene expression by regulation of the complex formation in Caenorhabditis elegans. The human DPY-30-like protein (DPY-30L) homolog is a conserved member of certain histone methyltransferase (HMT) complexes. In the human MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukemia-1) HMT complex, DPY-30L binds to the BRE2 homolog ASH2L in order to regulate histone 3-lysine 4 trimethylation. We have determined the 1.2-A crystal structure of the human DPY-30L C-terminal domain (DPY-30L(C)). The DPY-30L(C) structure, harboring the conserved DPY-30 motif, is composed of two alpha-helices linked by a sharp loop and forms a typical X-type four-helix bundle required for dimer formation. DPY-30L(C) dimer formation is largely mediated by an extensive hydrophobic interface with some additional polar interactions. The oligomerization of DPY-30L(C) in solution, together with its reported binding to ASH2L, leads us to propose that the hydrophobic surface of the dimer may provide a platform for interaction with ASH2L in the MLL1 HMT complex."
19423708,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Caveolin-3 negatively regulates recombinant cardiac K(ATP) channels.,"We have recently shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels in the heart are localized in the caveolae of cardiac myocytes and regulated by caveolae-related signaling. However, little is known about the role of caveolins, signature proteins of caveolae, in cardiac K(ATP) channel function. The present study was designed to explore the potential functional interaction between caveolin-3 and K(ATP) channels. The cardiac K(ATP) channel subunits Kir6.2 and SUR2A were transiently transfected in HEK293T cells with or without co-transfection of caveolin-3 or caveolin-1. Our data demonstrated that the recombinant K(ATP) channel activity in HEK293T cells was inhibited by expression of caveolin-3, but not caveolin-1. The application of caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide, corresponding to amino acid residues 55-74 of caveolin-3, blocked the inhibitory effect of caveolin-3 on K(ATP) channels. However, the same peptide did not have any significant effect on K(ATP) channels in HEK293T cells without caveolin-3 expression. We further confirmed that K(ATP) channels co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-3 but not caveolin-1. The association of K(ATP) channels with caveolin-3 was largely prevented by caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide. Our results indicate that caveolin-3 negatively regulates Kir6.2/SUR2A channel function."
19423846,0,BMC Biochem.,101084098,2009,A novel human NatA Nalpha-terminal acetyltransferase complex: hNaa16p-hNaa10p (hNat2-hArd1).,"BACKGROUND: Protein acetylation is among the most common protein modifications. The two major types are post-translational Nepsilon-lysine acetylation catalyzed by KATs (Lysine acetyltransferases, previously named HATs (histone acetyltransferases) and co-translational Nalpha-terminal acetylation catalyzed by NATs (N-terminal acetyltransferases). The major NAT complex in yeast, NatA, is composed of the catalytic subunit Naa10p (N alpha acetyltransferase 10 protein) (Ard1p) and the auxiliary subunit Naa15p (Nat1p). The NatA complex potentially acetylates Ser-, Ala-, Thr-, Gly-, Val- and Cys- N-termini after Met-cleavage. In humans, the homologues hNaa15p (hNat1) and hNaa10p (hArd1) were demonstrated to form a stable ribosome associated NAT complex acetylating NatA type N-termini in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We here describe a novel human protein, hNaa16p (hNat2), with 70% sequence identity to hNaa15p (hNat1). The gene encoding hNaa16p originates from an early vertebrate duplication event from the common ancestor of hNAA15 and hNAA16. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified both endogenous hNaa15p and hNaa16p as distinct interaction partners of hNaa10p in HEK293 cells, thus demonstrating the presence of both hNaa15p-hNaa10p and hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes. The hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex acetylates NatA type N-termini in vitro. hNaa16p is ribosome associated, supporting its potential role in cotranslational Nalpha-terminal acetylation. hNAA16 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines, but is generally less abundant as compared to hNAA15. Specific knockdown of hNAA16 induces cell death, suggesting an essential role for hNaa16p in human cells. CONCLUSION: At least two distinct NatA protein Nalpha-terminal acetyltransferases coexist in human cells potentially creating a more complex and flexible system for Nalpha-terminal acetylation as compared to lower eukaryotes."

Here we examined the inducibility of the ecdysone receptor-based RheoSwitch mammalian inducible expression system in proliferating cells and in cell cycle-arrested cells. We found that both contact inhibition and growth arrest subsequent to serum deprivation dramatically reduced the levels of induction of reporter genes that could be achieved in 3T3 fibroblasts but in not NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. These data have implications for the use of the RheoSwitch system in inducible gene expression applications."
19424490,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,"Isolation and characterization of a secreted, cell-surface glycoprotein SCUBE2 from humans.","SCUBE2 [signal peptide, CUB domain, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like protein 2] belongs to an evolutionarily conserved SCUBE protein family, which possesses domain organization characteristic of an N-terminal signal peptide sequence followed by nine EGF-like repeats, a spacer region, three cysteine-rich repeat motifs, and one CUB domain at the C-terminus. Despite several genetic analyses suggesting that the zebrafish orthologue of the mammalian SCUBE2 gene participates in HH (Hedgehog) signalling, the complete full-length cDNA and biochemical function for mammalian SCUBE2 on HH signalling remains uninvestigated. In the present study, we isolated the full-length cDNA and studied the role of human SCUBE2 in the HH signalling cascade. When overexpressed, recombinant human SCUBE2 manifests as a secreted surface-anchored glycoprotein. Deletion mapping analysis defines the critical role of the spacer region and/or cysteine-rich repeats for membrane association. Further biochemical analyses and functional reporter assays demonstrated that human SCUBE2 can specifically interact with SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) and SHH receptor PTCH1 (Patched-1), and enhance the SHH signalling activity within the cholesterol-rich raft microdomains of the plasma membranes. Together, our results reveal that human SCUBE2 is a novel positive component of the HH signal, acting upstream of ligand binding at the plasma membrane. Thus human SCUBE2 could play important roles in HH-related biology and pathology, such as during organ development and tumour progression."

Its visibility is gradually increasing, however, as advances in genetics, imaging, epidemiology, and pharmacology produce a more definitive understanding of the condition, and identify more specific and effective treatments.

19424502,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Quantitative deep sequencing reveals dynamic HIV-1 escape and large population shifts during CCR5 antagonist therapy in vivo.,"High-throughput sequencing platforms provide an approach for detecting rare HIV-1 variants and documenting more fully quasispecies diversity. We applied this technology to the V3 loop-coding region of env in samples collected from 4 chronically HIV-infected subjects in whom CCR5 antagonist (vicriviroc [VVC]) therapy failed. Between 25,000-140,000 amplified sequences were obtained per sample. Profound baseline V3 loop sequence heterogeneity existed; predicted CXCR4-using populations were identified in a largely CCR5-using population. The V3 loop forms associated with subsequent virologic failure, either through CXCR4 use or the emergence of high-level VVC resistance, were present as minor variants at 0.8-2.8% of baseline samples. Extreme, rapid shifts in population frequencies toward these forms occurred, and deep sequencing provided a detailed view of the rapid evolutionary impact of VVC selection. Greater V3 diversity was observed post-selection. This previously unreported degree of V3 loop sequence diversity has implications for viral pathogenesis, vaccine design, and the optimal use of HIV-1 CCR5 antagonists."

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) for excessive alcohol use in primary care in the Netherlands, which is targeted at early detection and treatment of 'at-risk' drinkers. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We compared a SBI scenario (opportunistic screening and brief intervention for 'at-risk' drinkers) in general practices with the current practice scenario (no SBI) in The Netherlands. We used the RIVM Chronic Disease Model (CDM) to extrapolate from decreased alcohol consumption to effects on health care costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. In total, 56,000 QALYs were gained at an additional cost of 298,000,000 euros due to providing alcohol SBI in the target population, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of 5,400 euros per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Prevention of excessive alcohol use by implementing SBI for excessive alcohol use in primary care settings appears to be cost-effective."
19425167,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Covert reorganization of implicit task representations by slow wave sleep.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that slow wave sleep (SWS) promotes the consolidation of memories that are subserved by mediotemporal- and hippocampo-cortical neural networks. In contrast to implicit memories, explicit memories are accompanied by conscious (attentive and controlled) processing. Awareness at pre-sleep encoding has been recognized as critical for the off-line memory consolidation. The present study elucidated the role of task-dependent cortical activation guided by attentional control at pre-sleep encoding for the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories during sleep. METHODOLOGY: A task with a hidden regularity was used (Number Reduction Task, NRT), in which the responses that can be implicitly predicted by the hidden regularity activate hippocampo-cortical networks more strongly than responses that cannot be predicted. Task performance was evaluated before and after early-night sleep, rich in SWS, and late-night sleep, rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In implicit conditions, slow cortical potentials (SPs) were analyzed to reflect the amount of controlled processing and the localization of activated neural task representations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During implicit learning before sleep, the amount of controlled processing did not differ between unpredictable and predictable responses, nor between early- and late-night sleep groups. A topographic re-distribution of SPs indicating a spatial reorganization occurred only after early, not after late sleep, and only for predictable responses. These SP changes correlated with the amount of SWS and were covert because off-line RT decrease did not differentiate response types or sleep groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that SWS promotes the neural reorganization of task representations that rely on the hippocampal system despite absence of conscious access to these representations. SIGNIFICANCE: Original neurophysiologic evidence is provided for the role of SWS in the consolidation of memories encoded with hippocampo-cortical interaction before sleep. It is demonstrated that this SWS-mediated mechanism does not depend critically on explicitness at learning nor on the amount of controlled executive processing during pre-sleep encoding."
19425605,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Semi-automated reconstruction of neural processes from large numbers of fluorescence images.,"We introduce a method for large scale reconstruction of complex bundles of neural processes from fluorescent image stacks. We imaged yellow fluorescent protein labeled axons that innervated a whole muscle, as well as dendrites in cerebral cortex, in transgenic mice, at the diffraction limit with a confocal microscope. Each image stack was digitally re-sampled along an orientation such that the majority of axons appeared in cross-section. A region growing algorithm was implemented in the open-source Reconstruct software and applied to the semi-automatic tracing of individual axons in three dimensions. The progression of region growing is constrained by user-specified criteria based on pixel values and object sizes, and the user has full control over the segmentation process. A full montage of reconstructed axons was assembled from the approximately 200 individually reconstructed stacks. Average reconstruction speed is approximately 0.5 mm per hour. We found an error rate in the automatic tracing mode of approximately 1 error per 250 um of axonal length. We demonstrated the capacity of the program by reconstructing the connectome of motor axons in a small mouse muscle."
19426462,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Novel cell-free strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis: in vitro generated conditioned medium can replace progenitor cell transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to ischemic tissue repair by both secretion of paracrine factors and incorporation into developing vessels. We tested the hypothesis that cell-free administration of paracrine factors secreted by cultured EPC may achieve an angiogenic effect equivalent to cell therapy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: EPC-derived conditioned medium (EPC-CM) was obtained from culture expanded EPC subjected to 72 hours of hypoxia. In vitro, EPC-CM significantly inhibited apoptosis of mature endothelial cells and promoted angiogenesis in a rat aortic ring assay. The therapeutic potential of EPC-CM as compared to EPC transplantation was evaluated in a rat model of chronic hindlimb ischemia. Serial intramuscular injections of EPC-CM and EPC both significantly increased hindlimb blood flow assessed by laser Doppler (81.2+/-2.9% and 83.7+/-3.0% vs. 53.5+/-2.4% of normal, P&lt;0.01) and improved muscle performance. A significantly increased capillary density (1.62+/-0.03 and 1.68+/-0.05/muscle fiber, P&lt;0.05), enhanced vascular maturation (8.6+/-0.3 and 8.1+/-0.4/HPF, P&lt;0.05) and muscle viability corroborated the findings of improved hindlimb perfusion and muscle function. Furthermore, EPC-CM transplantation stimulated the mobilization of bone marrow (BM)-derived EPC compared to control (678.7+/-44.1 vs. 340.0+/-29.1 CD34(+)/CD45(-) cells/1x10(5) mononuclear cells, P&lt;0.05) and their recruitment to the ischemic muscles (5.9+/-0.7 vs. 2.6+/-0.4 CD34(+) cells/HPF, P&lt;0.001) 3 days after the last injection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Intramuscular injection of EPC-CM is as effective as cell transplantation for promoting tissue revascularization and functional recovery. Owing to the technical and practical limitations of cell therapy, cell free conditioned media may represent a potent alternative for therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic cardiovascular diseases."
19426548,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Systemic inhibition of NF-kappaB activation protects from silicosis.,"BACKGROUND: Silicosis is a complex lung disease for which no successful treatment is available and therefore lung transplantation is a potential alternative. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of silicosis. TNFalpha signaling is mediated by the transcription factor, Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB, which regulates genes controlling several physiological processes including the innate immune responses, cell death, and inflammation. Therefore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation represents a potential therapeutic strategy for silicosis. METHODS/FINDINGS: In the present work we evaluated the lung transplant database (May 1986-July 2007) at the University of Pittsburgh to study the efficacy of lung transplantation in patients with silicosis (n = 11). We contrasted the overall survival and rate of graft rejection in these patients to that of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, n = 79) that was selected as a control group because survival benefit of lung transplantation has been identified for these patients. At the time of lung transplantation, we found the lungs of silica-exposed subjects to contain multiple foci of inflammatory cells and silicotic nodules with proximal TNFalpha expressing macrophage and NF-kappaB activation in epithelial cells. Patients with silicosis had poor survival (median survival 2.4 yr; confidence interval (CI): 0.16-7.88 yr) compared to IPF patients (5.3 yr; CI: 2.8-15 yr; p = 0.07), and experienced early rejection of their lung grafts (0.9 yr; CI: 0.22-0.9 yr) following lung transplantation (2.4 yr; CI:1.5-3.6 yr; p&lt;0.05). Using a mouse experimental model in which the endotracheal instillation of silica reproduces the silica-induced lung injury observed in humans we found that systemic inhibition of NF-kappaB activation with a pharmacologic inhibitor (BAY 11-7085) of IkappaB alpha phosphorylation decreased silica-induced inflammation and collagen deposition. In contrast, transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative IkappaB alpha mutant protein under the control of epithelial cell specific promoters demonstrate enhanced apoptosis and collagen deposition in their lungs in response to silica. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by its size, our data support that patients with silicosis appear to have poor outcome following lung transplantation. Experimental data indicate that while the systemic inhibition of NF-kappaB protects from silica-induced lung injury, epithelial cell specific NF-kappaB inhibition appears to aggravate the outcome of experimental silicosis."

As with many proteases, falcipain-2 is synthesized as a zymogen, and the prodomain inhibits activity of the mature enzyme. To investigate the mechanism of regulation of falcipain-2 by its prodomain, we expressed constructs encoding different portions of the prodomain and tested their ability to inhibit recombinant mature falcipain-2. We identified a C-terminal segment (Leu(155)-Asp(243)) of the prodomain, including two motifs (ERFNIN and GNFD) that are conserved in cathepsin L sub-family papain family proteases, as the mediator of prodomain inhibitory activity. Circular dichroism analysis showed that the prodomain including the C-terminal segment, but not constructs lacking this segment, was rich in secondary structure, suggesting that the segment plays a crucial role in protein folding. The falcipain-2 prodomain also efficiently inhibited other papain family proteases, including cathepsin K, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, and cruzain, but it did not inhibit cathepsin C or tested proteases of other classes. A structural model of pro-falcipain-2 was constructed by homology modeling based on crystallographic structures of mature falcipain-2, procathepsin K, procathepsin L, and procaricain, offering insights into the nature of the interaction between the prodomain and mature domain of falcipain-2 as well as into the broad specificity of inhibitory activity of the falcipain-2 prodomain."
19426805,0,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Fast statistical alignment.,"We describe a new program for the alignment of multiple biological sequences that is both statistically motivated and fast enough for problem sizes that arise in practice. Our Fast Statistical Alignment program is based on pair hidden Markov models which approximate an insertion/deletion process on a tree and uses a sequence annealing algorithm to combine the posterior probabilities estimated from these models into a multiple alignment. FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs. The centroid alignment approach taken by FSA, in combination with its learning procedure, drastically reduces the amount of false-positive alignment on biological data in comparison to that given by other methods. The FSA program and a companion visualization tool for exploring uncertainty in alignments can be used via a web interface at http://orangutan.math.berkeley.edu/fsa/, and the source code is available at http://fsa.sourceforge.net/."
19427038,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,High mutability of the tumor suppressor genes RASSF1 and RBSP3 (CTDSPL) in cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Many different genetic alterations are observed in cancer cells. Individual cancer genes display point mutations such as base changes, insertions and deletions that initiate and promote cancer growth and spread. Somatic hypermutation is a powerful mechanism for generation of different mutations. It was shown previously that somatic hypermutability of proto-oncogenes can induce development of lymphomas. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found an exceptionally high incidence of single-base mutations in the tumor suppressor genes RASSF1 and RBSP3 (CTDSPL) both located in 3p21.3 regions, LUCA and AP20 respectively. These regions contain clusters of tumor suppressor genes involved in multiple cancer types such as lung, kidney, breast, cervical, head and neck, nasopharyngeal, prostate and other carcinomas. Altogether in 144 sequenced RASSF1A clones (exons 1-2), 129 mutations were detected (mutation frequency, MF = 0.23 per 100 bp) and in 98 clones of exons 3-5 we found 146 mutations (MF = 0.29). In 85 sequenced RBSP3 clones, 89 mutations were found (MF = 0.10). The mutations were not cytidine-specific, as would be expected from alterations generated by AID/APOBEC family enzymes, and appeared de novo during cell proliferation. They diminished the ability of corresponding transgenes to suppress cell and tumor growth implying a loss of function. These high levels of somatic mutations were found both in cancer biopsies and cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of high frequencies of somatic mutations in RASSF1 and RBSP3 in different cancers suggesting it may underlay the mutator phenotype of cancer. Somatic hypermutations in tumor suppressor genes involved in major human malignancies offer a novel insight in cancer development, progression and spread."

Overlaps among the siRNA screens were very modest (&lt;7% for any pairwise combination), and similarly, only modest overlaps were seen in pairwise comparisons with other types of genome-wide studies. Combining all genes from the genome-wide studies together with genes reported in the literature to affect HIV yields 2,410 protein-coding genes, or fully 9.5% of all human genes (though of course some of these are false positive calls). Here we report an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; of all overlaps between studies (available at http://www.hostpathogen.org), which yielded a more extensively corroborated set of host factors assisting HIV replication. We used these genes to calculate refined networks that specify cellular subsystems recruited by HIV to assist in replication, and present additional analysis specifying host cell genes that are attractive as potential therapeutic targets."

The origin and evolution of this pathogen within the human lineage is still unresolved. A single species, P. reichenowi, which infects chimpanzees, is known to be a close sister lineage of P. falciparum. Here we report the discovery of a new Plasmodium species infecting Hominids. This new species has been isolated in two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) kept as pets by villagers in Gabon (Africa). Analysis of its complete mitochondrial genome (5529 nucleotides including Cyt b, Cox I and Cox III genes) reveals an older divergence of this lineage from the clade that includes P. falciparum and P. reichenowi (approximately 21+/-9 Myrs ago using Bayesian methods and considering that the divergence between P. falciparum and P. reichenowi occurred 4 to 7 million years ago as generally considered in the literature). This time frame would be congruent with the radiation of hominoids, suggesting that this Plasmodium lineage might have been present in early hominoids and that they may both have experienced a simultaneous diversification. Investigation of the nuclear genome of this new species will further the understanding of the genetic adaptations of P. falciparum to humans. The risk of transfer and emergence of this new species in humans must be now seriously considered given that it was found in two chimpanzees living in contact with humans and its close relatedness to the most virulent agent of malaria."
19427864,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Localisation of DivIVA by targeting to negatively curved membranes.,"DivIVA is a conserved protein in Gram-positive bacteria and involved in various processes related to cell growth, cell division and spore formation. DivIVA is specifically targeted to cell division sites and cell poles. In Bacillus subtilis, DivIVA helps to localise other proteins, such as the conserved cell division inhibitor proteins, MinC/MinD, and the chromosome segregation protein, RacA. Little is known about the mechanism that localises DivIVA. Here we show that DivIVA binds to liposomes, and that the N terminus harbours the membrane targeting sequence. The purified protein can stimulate binding of RacA to membranes. In mutants with aberrant cell shapes, DivIVA accumulates where the cell membrane is most strongly curved. On the basis of electron microscopic studies and other data, we propose that this is due to molecular bridging of the curvature by DivIVA multimers. This model may explain why DivIVA localises at cell division sites. A Monte-Carlo simulation study showed that molecular bridging can be a general mechanism for binding of proteins to negatively curved membranes."
19429605,0,Nature,410462,2009,The changing phases of extrasolar planet CoRoT-1b.,"Hot Jupiters are a class of extrasolar planet that orbit their parent stars at very short distances. They are expected to be tidally locked, which can lead to a large temperature difference between their daysides and nightsides. Infrared observations of eclipsing systems have yielded dayside temperatures for a number of transiting planets. The day-night contrast of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 189733b was 'mapped' using infrared observations. It is expected that the contrast between the daysides and nightsides of hot Jupiters is much higher at visual wavelengths, shorter than that of the peak emission, and could be further enhanced by reflected stellar light. Here we report the analysis of optical photometric data obtained over 36 planetary orbits of the transiting hot Jupiter CoRoT-1b. The data are consistent with the nightside hemisphere of the planet being entirely black, with the dayside flux dominating the optical phase curve. This means that at optical wavelengths the planet's phase variation is just as we see it for the interior planets in the Solar System. The data allow for only a small fraction of reflected light, corresponding to a geometric albedo of &lt;0.20."
19429607,0,Nature,410462,2009,Generation of transgenic non-human primates with germline transmission.,"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly attractive for use as a non-human primate animal model in biomedical research. It has a relatively high reproduction rate for a primate, making it potentially suitable for transgenic modification. Although several attempts have been made to produce non-human transgenic primates, transgene expression in the somatic tissues of live infants has not been demonstrated by objective analyses such as polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription or western blots. Here we show that the injection of a self-inactivating lentiviral vector in sucrose solution into marmoset embryos results in transgenic common marmosets that expressed the transgene in several organs. Notably, we achieved germline transmission of the transgene, and the transgenic offspring developed normally. The successful creation of transgenic marmosets provides a new animal model for human disease that has the great advantage of a close genetic relationship with humans. This model will be valuable to many fields of biomedical research."

Here we investigated the effects of MEK and PI-3K on cellular senescence. Unlike LY294002 (PI-3K inhibitor), both U0126 and PD98059 (MEK inhibitors) did not significantly decrease beta-Gal staining in aging human fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells. However, using a sensitive, functional method, we identified that not only LY294002 but also U0126 prevented irreversible loss of proliferative potential associated with cellular senescence. At concentrations that blocked S6 phosphorylation, rapamycin, U0126 and LY294002 equally prevented senescence. Furthermore, there was no additive effect by combining of rapamycin with either U0126 or LY294002. Taken together this suggests that (a) simultaneous activation of PI-3K and MEK is required to ensure cellular senescence and (b) U0126 and LY294002 suppress senescence via the rapamycin-sensitive pathway."

Invest.,7802877,2009,Immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by viral infections protect from type 1 diabetes in mice.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that is caused by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Viral infections induce immune responses that can damage beta cells and promote T1D or on the other hand prevent the development of the disease. However, the opposing roles of viral infections in T1D are not understood mechanistically. We report here that viruses that do not inflict damage on beta cells provided protection from T1D by triggering immunoregulatory mechanisms. Infection of prediabetic NOD mice with Coxsackie virus B3 or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) delayed diabetes onset and reduced disease incidence. Delayed T1D onset was due to transient upregulation of programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) on lymphoid cells, which prevented the expansion of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells expressing programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Reduced T1D incidence was caused by increased numbers of invigorated CD4+CD25+ Tregs, which produced TGF-beta and maintained long-term tolerance. Full protection from T1D resulted from synergy between PD-L1 and CD4+CD25+ Tregs. Our results provide what we believe to be novel mechanistic insight into the role of viruses in T1D and should be valuable for prospective studies in humans."
19429683,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Membrane potential greatly enhances superoxide generation by the cytochrome bc1 complex reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles.,"The mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex (ubiquinol/cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is generally thought to generate superoxide anion that participates in cell signaling and contributes to cellular damage in aging and degenerative disease. However, the isolated, detergent-solubilized bc(1) complex does not generate measurable amounts of superoxide except when inhibited by antimycin. In addition, indirect measurements of superoxide production by cells and isolated mitochondria have not clearly resolved the contribution of the bc(1) complex to the generation of superoxide by mitochondria in vivo, nor did they establish the effect, if any, of membrane potential on superoxide formation by this enzyme complex. In this study we show that the yeast cytochrome bc(1) complex does generate significant amounts of superoxide when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The rate of superoxide generation by the reconstituted bc(1) complex increased exponentially with increased magnitude of the membrane potential, a finding that is compatible with the suggestion that membrane potential inhibits electron transfer from the cytochrome b(L) to b(H) hemes, thereby promoting the formation of a ubisemiquinone radical that interacts with oxygen to generate superoxide. When the membrane potential was further increased, by the addition of nigericin or by the imposition of a diffusion potential, the rate of generation of superoxide was further accelerated and approached the rate obtained with antimycin. These findings suggest that the bc(1) complex may contribute significantly to superoxide generation by mitochondria in vivo, and that the rate of superoxide generation can be controlled by modulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential."
19429692,1,Science,404511,2009,"Volcanism, mass extinction, and carbon isotope fluctuations in the Middle Permian of China.",The 260-million-year-old Emeishan volcanic province of southwest China overlies and is interbedded with Middle Permian carbonates that contain a record of the Guadalupian mass extinction. Sections in the region thus provide an opportunity to directly monitor the relative timing of extinction and volcanism within the same locations. These show that the onset of volcanism was marked by both large phreatomagmatic eruptions and extinctions amongst fusulinacean foraminifers and calcareous algae. The temporal coincidence of these two phenomena supports the idea of a cause-and-effect relationship. The crisis predates the onset of a major negative carbon isotope excursion that points to subsequent severe disturbance of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle.
19429706,1,Science,404511,2009,Tearing of stagnant slab.,"Subducted slabs of oceanic lithosphere below the western Pacific tend to be stagnant in the transition zone with poorly known mechanical properties. Typical examples are the Izu-Bonin and Japan slabs that meet each other to form a cusplike junction beneath southwest Japan. Here, we show that these two slabs are torn apart at their junction when they bend to flatten over the 660-kilometer discontinuity, as is expected from a simple geometric argument. We present three lines of evidence for this ongoing slab tear."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Corneal dystrophy-associated R124H mutation disrupts TGFBI interaction with Periostin and causes mislocalization to the lysosome.,"The 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies are heterogeneous autosomal-dominant eye disorders pathologically characterized by the progressive accumulation of aggregated proteinaceous deposits in the cornea, which manifests clinically as severe vision impairment. The 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies are commonly caused by mutations in the TGFBI (transforming growth factor-beta-induced) gene. However, despite the identification of the culprit gene, the cellular roles of TGFBI and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of corneal dystrophy remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of periostin, a molecule that is highly related to TGFBI, as a specific TGFBI-binding partner. The association of TGFBI and periostin is mediated by the amino-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domains of TGFBI and periostin. Our results indicate that the endogenous TGFBI and periostin colocalize within the trans-Golgi network and associate prior to secretion. The corneal dystrophy-associated R124H mutation in TGFBI severely impairs interaction with periostin in vivo. In addition, the R124H mutation causes aberrant redistribution of the mutant TGFBI into lysosomes. We also find that the periostin-TGFBI interaction is disrupted in corneal fibroblasts cultured from granular corneal dystrophy type II patients and that periostin accumulates in TGFBI-positive corneal deposits in granular corneal dystrophy type II (also known as Avellino corneal dystrophy). Together, our findings suggest that TGFBI and periostin may play cooperative cellular roles and that periostin may be involved in the pathogenesis of 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,On the origin of terrestrial homochirality for nucleosides and amino acids.,"Before life could start on earth, it was important that the amino acid building blocks be present in a predominant handedness called the L configuration and that the ribose of RNA be predominantly in the D configuration. Because ordinary chemical processes would produce them in equal L and D amounts, it has long been a puzzle how the needed selectivities could have arisen. Carbonaceous chondrites such as the Murchison meteorite, which landed in Australia in 1969, brought some unusual amino acids with a methyl group replacing their alpha hydrogen. They cannot racemize and have a small but real excess of those with the L configuration. We have shown that they can partake in a synthesis of normal L amino acids under credible prebiotic conditions. We and others showed that small preferences can be amplified into solutions with very high dominance of the L amino acids because of the higher solubility of the pure L form than of the more stable DL racemic compound crystal. Here, we show that such solubility-based amplification of small excesses of three D nucleosides, uridine, adenosine, and cytidine, can also occur to form solutions with very high D dominance under credible prebiotic conditions. Guanosine crystallizes as a conglomerate and does not amplify in this way. However, under prebiotic conditions it could have been formed from homochiral D ribose from the hydrolysis of amplified adenosine or cytidine."

Here, we describe a new function of these cells, the elimination of retrovirus-infected macrophages. After experimental CD8(+) cell depletion, elite controlling macaques with set-point viral loads &lt; or = 500 viral RNA copies/mL mounted robust Gag- and Nef-specific CD4(+) T cell responses during reestablishment of control with &gt; or = 54% of all virus-specific CD4(+) T cells targeting these 2 proteins. Ex vivo, these simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific CD4(+) T cells neither recognized nor suppressed viral replication in SIV-infected CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, they recognized SIV-infected macrophages as early as 2 h postinfection because of presentation of epitopes derived from virion-associated Gag and Nef proteins. Furthermore, virus-specific CD4(+) T cells displayed direct effector function and eliminated SIV-infected macrophages. These results suggest that retrovirus-specific CD4(+) T cells may contribute directly to elite control by inhibiting viral replication in macrophages."

Genet.,9208958,2009,Segregation of expression of mPeriod gene homologs in neurons and glia: possible divergent roles of mPeriod1 and mPeriod2 in the brain.,"The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus function as the master circadian clock, coordinating the timing of diverse cell populations and organ systems. Dysregulation of clock timing is linked to a broad range of human conditions, including obesity, cardiovascular disease and a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. Aberrant regulation of expression of the PERIOD genes has been associated with improper cell division and human cancers, while the autosomal dominant disorder familial advanced sleep phase syndrome has been mapped to a single missense mutation within the critical clock gene hPERIOD2. An essential tool to begin to dissect the inherent molecular timing process is the clock gene reporter. Here, we functionally characterize two new mouse transgenic clock reporters, mPeriod1-Venus and mPeriod2-DsRED. Venus and DsRED are fluorescent proteins that can be used to monitor transcription in individual cells in real-time. Imaging of the SCN revealed oscillations, as well as light inducibility, in Venus and DsRED expression. Rhythmic Venus and DsRED expression was observed in distinct SCN cell populations, suggesting the existence of discrete cellular SCN clocks. Outside of the SCN, mPeriod1-Venus expression was broadly expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal populations. Conversely, mPeriod2-DsRED was expressed in glial populations and progenitor cells of the dentate gyrus; limited expression was detected in neurons. This distinct expression pattern of the two reporters reveals that the central nervous system possesses mechanistically distinct subpopulations of neuronal and non-neuronal cellular clocks. These novel mouse models will facilitate our understanding of clock timing and its role in human diseases."

Immunol.,7905289,2009,"Characterization of two alternative Interleukin(IL)-10 5'UTR mRNA sequences, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","IL-10 production shows a broad-spectrum of individual response, suggesting a genetic component of approximately 75%. Different polymorphisms located close to, or within the IL-10 gene has been demonstrated to influence its transcription rate whereas the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-10 production has not well elucidated. The main responsible elements at this control level are both the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR's) of mRNAs, and as the 3'-UTR regions are mainly involved in the stability and decay rate of mRNAs, the 5'-UTR regions mediate the binding rate of the molecule with ribosomal 40S subunit as a cis-acting element. Herein are report data on the identification of two IL10 mRNA that differ by the length of respective 5'UTR regions (160 and 288 nucleotides, respectively; EMBL accession nrs: EU751618 and EU751619) produced after stimulation of human blood samples with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The longer 5'UTR is constitutively expressed in unstimulated PBMC cells cultured at 37 degrees C for 24h, while in LPS stimulated cells an additional IL-10 mRNA molecule, containing a shorter 5'UTR, is synthesized. RNADRAW software (http://www.rnadraw.com/) analysis have indicated that the secondary structures of the shorter 5'UTR IL-10 mRNA region is more available for the binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. In conclusion, our data seem to suggest that LPS could influence the post-transcriptional control of IL-10 production inducing an alternative mRNA immediately available in response to the inflammatory stimulation."
19430532,0,Cancer Cell,101130617,2009,A gene expression signature associated with &quot;K-Ras addiction&quot; reveals regulators of EMT and tumor cell survival.,"K-ras mutations occur frequently in epithelial cancers. Using short hairpin RNAs to deplete K-Ras in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring K-ras mutations, two classes were identified-lines that do or do not require K-Ras to maintain viability. Comparing these two classes of cancer cells revealed a gene expression signature in K-Ras-dependent cells, associated with a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype, which was also seen in primary tumors. Several of these genes encode pharmacologically tractable proteins, such as Syk and Ron kinases and integrin beta6, depletion of which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and apoptosis specifically in K-Ras-dependent cells. These findings indicate that epithelial differentiation and tumor cell viability are associated, and that EMT regulators in &quot;K-Ras-addicted&quot; cancers represent candidate therapeutic targets."
19432394,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We now identify the four regulated sites of CRHSP-24 phosphorylation as serines 30, 32, 41, and 52 and show that Ser(30) and Ser(32) are directly dephosphorylated by calcineurin. Coordinate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these four serines explains the multiple phosphorylated isoforms of CRHSP-24 present in acinar cells and provides a molecular framework to study CRHSP-24 regulation by secretagogues and growth factor-induced kinases and phosphatases in vivo."
19432473,0,Neuron,8809320,2009,Separate neural mechanisms underlie choices and strategic preferences in risky decision making.,"Adaptive decision making in real-world contexts often relies on strategic simplifications of decision problems. Yet, the neural mechanisms that shape these strategies and their implementation remain largely unknown. Using an economic decision-making task, we dissociate brain regions that predict specific choices from those predicting an individual's preferred strategy. Choices that maximized gains or minimized losses were predicted by functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex or anterior insula, respectively. However, choices that followed a simplifying strategy (i.e., attending to overall probability of winning) were associated with activation in parietal and lateral prefrontal cortices. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, through differential functional connectivity with parietal and insular cortex, predicted individual variability in strategic preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that robust decision strategies follow from neural sensitivity to rewards. We conclude that decision making reflects more than compensatory interaction of choice-related regions; in addition, specific brain systems potentiate choices depending on strategies, traits, and context."
19433057,0,Neuron,8809320,2009,Inhibitory regulation of electrically coupled neurons in the inferior olive is mediated by asynchronous release of GABA.,"Inhibitory projection neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) provide GABAergic input to neurons of the inferior olive (IO) that in turn produce climbing fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. Anatomical evidence suggests that DCN to IO synapses control electrical coupling between IO neurons. In vivo studies suggest that they also control the synchrony of IO neurons and play an important role in cerebellar learning. Here we describe the DCN to IO synapse. Remarkably, GABA release was almost exclusively asynchronous, with little conventional synchronous release. Synaptic transmission was extremely frequency dependent, with low-frequency stimulation being largely ineffective. However, due to the prominence of asynchronous release, stimulation at frequencies above 10 Hz evoked steady-state inhibitory currents. These properties seem ideally suited to transform the firing rate of DCN neurons into sustained inhibition that both suppresses the firing of IO cells and regulates the effective coupling between IO neurons."
19433444,0,Neuron,8809320,2009,Wnt signaling mediates experience-related regulation of synapse numbers and mossy fiber connectivities in the adult hippocampus.,"We investigated how experience regulates the structure of a defined neuronal circuit in adult mice. Enriched environment (EE) produced a robust and reversible increase in hippocampal stratum lucidum synapse numbers, mossy fiber terminal (LMT) numbers, and spine plus synapse densities at LMTs, whereas a distinct mechanism depending on Rab3a promoted LMT volume growth. In parallel, EE increased postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron Wnt7a/b levels. Inhibiting Wnt signaling through locally applied sFRP-1 suppressed the effects of EE on synapse numbers and further reduced synapse numbers in control mice. Wnt7 applied to CA3 mimicked the effects of EE on synapse and LMT numbers. CA3 Wnt7a/b levels were enhanced by excitatory activity and reduced by sFRP-1. Synapse numbers and Wnt7a/b levels peaked in mice aged 6-12 months; a decline in aged mice was reversed by EE. Therefore, behavioral experience specifically regulates adult global stratum lucidum synapse numbers and hippocampal network structure through Wnt signaling."
19433447,0,Neuron,8809320,2009,Functional and evolutionary insights into human brain development through global transcriptome analysis.,"Our understanding of the evolution, formation, and pathological disruption of human brain circuits is impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on the developing brain transcriptome. A whole-genome, exon-level expression analysis of 13 regions from left and right sides of the mid-fetal human brain revealed that 76% of genes are expressed, and 44% of these are differentially regulated. These data reveal a large number of specific gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, as well as coexpression networks, associated with distinct regions and neurodevelopmental processes. Of particular relevance to cognitive specializations, we have characterized the transcriptional landscapes of prefrontal cortex and perisylvian speech and language areas, which exhibit a population-level global expression symmetry. We show that differentially expressed genes are more frequently associated with human-specific evolution of putative cis-regulatory elements. These data provide a wealth of biological insights into the complex transcriptional and molecular underpinnings of human brain development and evolution."

The three zhankuic acids, 1, 5 and 7 displayed the most potent cytotoxic effect with an IC(50) value of 22.3-75.0microM. The compound 3 was selectively cytotoxic in three colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, HCT-116 and SW-480) and a breast cancer model (MDA-MB-231), whereas 8 only showed its cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231. None of these isolates was toxic to mammary epithelial (MCF10A) and primary foreskin fibroblast (HS68) cells, two human normal cell lines. The compounds 1, 5 and 7 were also demonstrated to induce apoptosis in HT-29 and SW-480 cells, as confirmed by sub-G1 cell cycle arrest. In HT-29 cells, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 were suppressed by compounds 1, 5 and 7. A mixture containing 4microM each of compounds 1, 5 and 7 also showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect in HT-29 cells."
19433543,0,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Biases in Drosophila melanogaster protein trap screens.,"BACKGROUND: The ability to localise or follow endogenous proteins in real time in vivo is of tremendous utility for cell biology or systems biology studies. Protein trap screens utilise the random genomic insertion of a transposon-borne artificial reporter exon (e.g. encoding the green fluorescent protein, GFP) into an intron of an endogenous gene to generate a fluorescent fusion protein. Despite recent efforts aimed at achieving comprehensive coverage of the genes encoded in the Drosophila genome, the repertoire of genes that yield protein traps is still small. RESULTS: We analysed the collection of available protein trap lines in Drosophila melanogaster and identified potential biases that are likely to restrict genome coverage in protein trap screens. The protein trap screens investigated here primarily used P-element vectors and thus exhibit some of the same positional biases associated with this transposon that are evident from the comprehensive Drosophila Gene Disruption Project. We further found that protein trap target genes usually exhibit broad and persistent expression during embryonic development, which is likely to facilitate better detection. In addition, we investigated the likely influence of the GFP exon on host protein structure and found that protein trap insertions have a significant bias for exon-exon boundaries that encode disordered protein regions. 38.8% of GFP insertions land in disordered protein regions compared with only 23.4% in the case of non-trapping P-element insertions landing in coding sequence introns (p &lt; 10(-4)). Interestingly, even in cases where protein domains are predicted, protein trap insertions frequently occur in regions encoding surface exposed areas that are likely to be functionally neutral. Considering the various biases observed, we predict that less than one third of intron-containing genes are likely to be amenable to trapping by the existing methods. CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that the utility of P-element vectors for protein trap screens has largely been exhausted, and that approximately 2,800 genes may still be amenable using piggyBac vectors. Thus protein trap strategies based on current approaches are unlikely to offer true genome-wide coverage. We suggest that either transposons with reduced insertion bias or recombineering-based targeting techniques will be required for comprehensive genome coverage in Drosophila."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Chronic stress elicits prolonged activation of alpha-MSH secretion and subsequent degeneration of melanotroph.,"Prolonged stress affects homeostasis in various organs and induces stress-associated disorders. We examined the cellular changes of pituitary gland under the continuous stress condition using a rat model in which rats were kept in a cage filled with water to a height of 1.5 cm for up to 5 days. Among the pituitary hormone mRNAs, proopiomelanocortin mRNA was up-regulated specifically in the intermediate lobe (IL) of this rat model. Additionally, the peripheral blood levels of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a major product of proopiomelanocortin in IL were increased. The alpha-MSH secreting cells, melanotrophs, showed a markedly developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in the early phase of the experiment. Subsequent continuous stress caused remarkable dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum, disruption of the Golgi structure, and the degeneration of some melanotrophs. In addition the dopaminergic nerve fibers from hypothalamus were markedly decreased in IL. A dopamine antagonist elicited the similar morphologic changes of melanotroph in normal rat. These findings suggest that prolonged stress suppressed hypothalamus-derived dopamine release in IL, which elicited over-secretion of alpha-MSH from the melanotrophs. The present study also suggests that prolonged hyperactivation of endocrine cells could lead to disorder of secretion mechanisms and eventual degeneration."
19433583,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Dynamic chromatin remodeling events in hippocampal neurons are associated with NMDA receptor-mediated activation of Bdnf gene promoter 1.,"To determine the epigenetic events associated with NMDA receptor-mediated activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (Bdnf) promoter 1 by hippocampal neurons in culture, we screened 12 loci across 4.5 kb of genomic DNA 5' of the transcription start site (TSS) of rat Bdnf for specific changes in histone modification and transcription factor binding following NMDA receptor stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that NMDA receptor stimulation produced a durable, time-dependent decrease in histone H3 at lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), within 3 h after NMDA treatment across multiple loci. Concomitant increases in H3K4me2 and H3K9/14 acetylation (H3AcK9/14) were associated with transcriptional activation, but occurred at fewer sites within the promoter. The decrease in H3K9me2 was associated with release of HDAC1, MBD1, MeCP2, and REST from specific locations within promoter 1, although with different kinetics. In addition, occupancy of sites proximal to and distal to the TSS by the transcription factors NF-kappaB, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and cAMP-response element-binding protein were correlated with increased occupancy of RNA polymerase II at two loci proximal to the TSS following NMDA receptor stimulation. These temporal changes in promoter occupancy could occur thousands of base pairs 5' of the TSS, suggesting a mechanism that produces waves of Bdnf transcription."
19433783,0,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Construction of a novel detection system for protein-protein interactions using yeast G-protein signaling.,"In the current study, we report the construction of a novel system for the detection of protein-protein interactions using yeast G-protein signaling. It is well established that the G-protein gamma subunit (Ggamma) is anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via lipid modification in the C-terminus, and that this localization of Ggamma is required for signal transduction. In our system, mutated Ggamma (Ggamma(cyto)) lacking membrane localization ability was genetically prepared by deletion of the lipid modification site. Complete disappearance of G-protein signal was observed when Ggamma(cyto) was expressed in the cytoplasm of yeast cells from which the endogenous Ggamma gene had been deleted. In order to demonstrate the potential use of our system, we utilized the Staphylococcus aureus ZZ domain and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a model interaction pair. To design our detection system for protein-protein interaction, the ZZ domain was altered so that it associates with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the Fc part was then fused to Ggamma(cyto). The Fc-Ggamma(cyto) fusion protein migrated towards the membrane via the ZZ-Fc interaction, and signal transduction was therefore restored. This signal was successfully detected by assessing growth inhibition and transcription in response to G-protein signaling. Finally, several Z variants displaying affinity constants ranging from 8.0 x 10(3) to 6.8 x 10(8) m(-1) were prepared, and it was demonstrated that our system was able to discriminate subtle differences in affinity. In conclusion, our system appears to be a reliable and versatile technique for detection of protein-protein interactions, and may prove useful in future protein interaction studies."

The Hammett plot of log(k(cat,R)/k(cat,H)) versus sigma(p) (-) has three linear segments, which distinguishes the enzyme from the other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases for which data are available. Three amino acids in the vicinity of the catalytic SerB1 (AsnB241, AlaB69, and GlnB23) were included in the quantum mechanical model. The stable structures and the transition states for acylation were optimized by molecular mechanical modeling and at the AM1 level of theory for three model substrates (with H, a methoxy group or a nitro group in the para position in the leaving group). Intrinsic interactions of several functional groups at the active site of PGA are discussed in relation to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The energy barrier computed for the first step of acylation (the nucleophilic attack of SerB1) is lower than that for the second step (the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate). However, the electronic properties of the substituent on the leaving group affect the structure of the second transition state. It is shown that the main chain carbonyl group of GlnB23 forms a hydrogen bond with the leaving group nitrogen, thus influencing the hydrolysis rate. On the basis of our computations, we propose an interpretation of the complex character of the Hammett plot for the reaction catalyzed by PGA. We suggest a modified scheme of the catalytic mechanism in which some of the intramolecular interactions essential for catalysis are included."
19433790,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Direct measurement of photoinduced charge separation distances in donor-acceptor systems for artificial photosynthesis using OOP-ESEEM.,"The distance over which two photogenerated charges are separated in electron donor-acceptor systems for artificial photosynthesis depends on the structure of the system, while the lifetime of the charge separation and, ultimately, its ability to carry out useful redox chemistry depend on the electronic coupling between the oxidized donor and reduced acceptor. The radical ions produced by charge separation are frequently delocalized over the pi systems of the final oxidized donor and reduced acceptor, so that there is often significant uncertainty as to the average distance between the separated charges, especially in low dielectric constant media, where the Coulomb attraction of the ions may be significant and the charge distribution of the ions may be distorted, so that the average distance between them may be shorter than that implied by their chemical structures. The charge separation distances between photogenerated radical ions in three donor-acceptor molecules having different donor-acceptor distances were measured directly from their dipolar spin-spin interactions using out-of-phase electron spin echo envelope modulation (OOP-ESEEM). The measured distances in toluene at 85 K compare favorably to the calculated distances between the centroids of the spin distributions of the radical ions within the radical ion pairs. These results show that despite the intrinsically nonpolar nature of medium, the spin (and charge) distributions of the RPs are not significantly distorted by Coulomb attraction over these long distances. This study shows that OOP-ESEEM is well-suited for probing the detailed structural features of charge-separated intermediates that are essential to understanding how to design molecular structures that prolong and control charge separation for artificial photosynthesis."

Studies described herein demonstrate that intramolecular H-bonding interactions can significantly increase the rate and levels of stereochemical control in Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions. The utility of H-bonding in catalytic olefin metathesis is elucidated through development of exceptionally facile and highly diastereoselective ring-opening/cross-metathesis (DROCM) reactions, involving achiral Ru catalysts and enantiomerically enriched allylic alcohols. Transformations proceed to completion readily (&gt; 98% conversion, up to 87% yield), often within minutes, in the presence of &lt; or = 2 mol % of an achiral catalyst to afford synthetically versatile products of high stereochemical purity (up to &gt; 98:2 dr and 11:1 E:Z)."
19434100,0,Nature,410462,2009,Structural insight into the autoinhibition mechanism of AMP-activated protein kinase.,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is characterized by its ability to bind to AMP, which enables it to adjust enzymatic activity by sensing the cellular energy status and maintain the balance between ATP production and consumption in eukaryotic cells. It also has important roles in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, and in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. These important functions have rendered AMPK an important drug target for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer treatments. However, the regulatory mechanism of AMPK activity by AMP binding remains unsolved. Here we report the crystal structures of an unphosphorylated fragment of the AMPK alpha-subunit (KD-AID) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that contains both the catalytic kinase domain and an autoinhibitory domain (AID), and of a phosphorylated kinase domain from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Snf1-pKD). The AID binds, from the 'backside', to the hinge region of its kinase domain, forming contacts with both amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal lobes. Structural analyses indicate that AID binding might constrain the mobility of helix alphaC, hence resulting in an autoinhibited KD-AID with much lower kinase activity than that of the kinase domain alone. AMP activates AMPK both allosterically and by inhibiting dephosphorylation. Further in vitro kinetic studies demonstrate that disruption of the KD-AID interface reverses the autoinhibition and these AMPK heterotrimeric mutants no longer respond to the change in AMP concentration. The structural and biochemical data have shown the primary mechanism of AMPK autoinhibition and suggest a conformational switch model for AMPK activation by AMP."

The mRNA and protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), VEGF, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) were determined by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy was used to examine the structural alterations in retinal cells, and rhodamine isothiocyanate (RhIC) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was administered intraperitoneally or intravenously to determine vascular permeability. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS, along with VEGF concentration and NO production, were increased in response to hypoxia. Swollen Müller cell processes, apoptotic and necrotic cells in the inner nuclear layer, and changes in ganglion cells such as swollen and disrupted mitochondria were observed in hypoxic animals. Increased leakage of RhIC and HRP from retinal and hyaloid vessels was seen after hypoxic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that increased VEGF and NO production in hypoxia resulted in increased vascular permeability, leading to changes in Müller cells and degeneration of neural cells. Melatonin administration reduced VEGF and NO production, diminished leakage of RhIC and HRP, and promoted cell proliferation, suggesting this as a potential therapeutic agent in reducing hypoxia-associated damage in the developing retina."

Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Cerebral activity during the anesthesia-like state induced by mesopontine microinjection of pentobarbital.,"Microinjection of pentobarbital into a restricted region of rat brainstem, the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA), induces a reversible anesthesia-like state characterized by loss of the righting reflex, atonia, antinociception, and loss of consciousness as assessed by electroencephalogram synchronization. We examined cerebral activity during this state using FOS expression as a marker. Animals were anesthetized for 50 min with a series of intracerebral microinjections of pentobarbital or with systemic pentobarbital and intracerebral microinjections of vehicle. FOS expression was compared with that in awake animals microinjected with vehicle. Neural activity was suppressed throughout the cortex whether anesthesia was induced by systemic or MPTA routes. Changes were less consistent subcortically. In the zona incerta and the nucleus raphe pallidus, expression was strongly suppressed during systemic anesthesia, but only mildly during MPTA-induced anesthesia. Dissociation was seen in the tuberomammillary nucleus where suppression occurred during systemic-induced anesthesia only, and in the lateral habenular nucleus where activity was markedly increased during systemic-induced anesthesia but not following intracerebral microinjection. Several subcortical nuclei previously associated with cerebral arousal were not affected. In the MPTA itself FOS expression was suppressed during systemic anesthesia. Differences in the pattern of brain activity in the two modes of anesthesia are consistent with the possibility that anesthetic endpoints might be achieved by alternative mechanisms: direct drug action for systemic anesthesia or via ascending pathways for MPTA-induced anesthesia. However, it is also possible that systemically administered agents induce anesthesia, at least in part, by a primary action in the MPTA with cortical inhibition occurring secondarily."
19435303,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Relationship among brain and blood glucose levels and spontaneous and glucoprivic feeding.,"Although several studies implicate small declines in blood glucose levels as stimulus for spontaneous meal initiation, no mechanism is known for how these dips might initiate feeding. To assess the role of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (arcuate plus ventromedial nucleus) glucosensing neurons as potential mediators of spontaneous and glucoprivic feeding, meal patterns were observed, and blood and VMH microdialysis fluid were sampled in 15 rats every 10 min for 3.5 h after dark onset and 2 h after insulin (5 U/kg, i.v.) infusion. Blood glucose levels declined by 11% beginning approximately 5 min before 65% of all spontaneous meals, with no fall in VMH levels. After insulin, blood and VMH glucose reached nadirs by 30-40 min, and the same rats ate 60% faster and spent 84% more time eating during the ensuing hypoglycemia. Although 83% of first hypoglycemic meals were preceded by 5 min dips in VMH (but not blood) glucose levels, neither blood nor VMH levels declined before second meals, suggesting that low glucose, rather than changing levels, was the stimulus for glucoprivic meals. Furthermore, altering VMH glucosensing by raising or lowering glucokinase (GK) activity failed to affect spontaneous feeding, body or adipose weights, or glucose tolerance. However, chronic depletion by 26-70% of VMH GK mRNA reduced glucoprivic feeding. Thus, although VMH glucosensing does not appear to be involved in either spontaneous feeding or long-term body-weight regulation, it does participate in glucoprivic feeding, similar to its role in the counter-regulatory neurohumoral responses to glucoprivation."
19435313,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Compensatory enhancement of intrinsic spiking upon NKCC1 disruption in neonatal hippocampus.,"Depolarizing and excitatory GABA actions are thought to be important in cortical development. We show here that GABA has no excitatory action on CA3 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from neonatal NKCC1(-/-) mice that lack the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter isoform 1. Strikingly, NKCC1(-/-) slices generated endogenous network events similar to giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), but, unlike in wild-type slices, the GDPs were not facilitated by the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine or blocked by the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide. The developmental upregulation of the K-Cl cotransporter 2 (KCC2) was unperturbed, whereas the pharmacologically isolated glutamatergic network activity and the intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons were enhanced in the NKCC1(-/-) hippocampus. Hence, developmental expression of KCC2, unsilencing of AMPA-type synapses, and early network events can take place in the absence of excitatory GABAergic signaling in the neonatal hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that genetic as well as pharmacologically induced loss of NKCC1-dependent excitatory actions of GABA results in a dramatic compensatory increase in the intrinsic excitability of glutamatergic neurons, pointing to powerful homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in the developing hippocampal circuitry."
19435315,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Distinct effects of Hedgehog signaling on neuronal fate specification and cell cycle progression in the embryonic mouse retina.,"Cell-extrinsic signals can profoundly influence the production of various neurons from common progenitors. Yet mechanisms by which extrinsic signals coordinate progenitor cell proliferation, cell cycle exit, and cell fate choices are not well understood. Here, we address whether Hedgehog (Hh) signals independently regulate progenitor proliferation and neuronal fate decisions in the embryonic mouse retina. Conditional ablation of the essential Hh signaling component Smoothened (Smo) in proliferating progenitors, rather than in nascent postmitotic neurons, leads to a dramatic increase of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and a mild increase of cone photoreceptor precursors without significantly affecting other early-born neuronal cell types. In addition, Smo-deficient progenitors exhibit aberrant expression of cell cycle regulators and delayed G(1)/S transition, especially during the late embryonic stages, resulting in a reduced progenitor pool by birth. Deficiency in Smo function also causes reduced expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription repressor Hes1 and preferential elevation of the proneural gene Math5. In Smo and Math5 double knock-out mutants, the enhanced RGC production observed in Smo-deficient retinas is abolished, whereas defects in the G(1)/S transition persist, suggesting that Math5 mediates the Hh effect on neuronal fate specification but not on cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that Hh signals regulate progenitor pool expansion primarily by promoting cell cycle progression and influence cell cycle exit and neuronal fates by controlling specific proneural genes. Together, these distinct cellular effects of Hh signaling in neural progenitor cells coordinate a balanced production of diverse neuronal cell types."
19435345,0,Genetics,374636,2009,Global analysis of allele-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Gene expression is a complex trait determined by various genetic and nongenetic factors. Among the genetic factors, allelic difference may play a critical role in gene regulation. In this study we globally dissected cis (allelic) and trans sources of genetic variation in F(1) hybrids between two Arabidopsis thaliana wild accessions, Columbia (Col) and Vancouver (Van), using a new high-density SNP-tiling array. This array tiles the whole genome with 35-bp resolution and interrogates 250,000 SNPs identified from resequencing of 20 diverse A. thaliana strains. Quantitative assessment of 12,311 genes identified 3811 genes differentially expressed between parents, 1665 genes with allele-specific expression, and 1688 genes controlled by composite trans-regulatory variation. Loci with cis- or trans-regulatory variation were mapped onto sequence polymorphisms, epigenetic modifications, and transcriptional specificity. Genes regulated in cis tend to be located in polymorphic chromosomal regions, are preferentially associated with repressive epigenetic marks, and exhibit high tissue expression specificity. Genes that vary due to trans regulation reside in relatively conserved chromosome regions, show activating epigenetic marks and generally constitutive gene expression. Our findings demonstrate a method of global functional characterization of allele-specific expression and highlight that chromatin structure is intertwined with evolution of cis- and trans-regulatory variation."
19435352,0,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Hydrogen sulfide ameliorates hyperhomocysteinemia-associated chronic renal failure.,"Elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), is associated with end-stage renal diseases. Hcy metabolizes in the body to produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), and studies have demonstrated a protective role of H(2)S in end-stage organ failure. However, the role of H(2)S in HHcy-associated renal diseases is unclear. The present study was aimed to determine the role of H(2)S in HHcy-associated renal damage. Cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous (CBS+/-) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) mice with two kidney (2-K) were used in this study and supplemented with or without NaHS (30 micromol/l, H(2)S donor) in the drinking water. To expedite the HHcy-associated glomerular damage, uninephrectomized (1-K) CBS(+/-) and 1-K WT mice were also used with or without NaHS supplementation. Plasma Hcy levels were elevated in CBS(+/-) 2-K and 1-K and WT 1-K mice along with increased proteinuria, whereas, plasma levels of H(2)S were attenuated in these groups compared with WT 2-K mice. Interestingly, H(2)S supplementation increased plasma H(2)S level and normalized the urinary protein secretion in the similar groups of animals as above. Increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 and apoptotic cells were observed in the renal cortical tissues of CBS(+/-) 2-K and 1-K and WT 1-K mice; however, H(2)S prevented apoptotic cell death and normalized increased MMP activities. Increased expression of desmin and downregulation of nephrin in the cortical tissue of CBS(+/-) 2-K and 1-K and WT 1-K mice were ameliorated with H(2)S supplementation. Additionally, in the kidney tissues of CBS(+/-) 2-K and 1-K and WT 1-K mice, increased superoxide (O(2)(*-)) production and reduced glutathione (GSH)-to-oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio were normalized with exogenous H(2)S supplementation. These results demonstrate that HHcy-associated renal damage is related to decreased endogenous H(2)S generation in the body. Additionally, here we demonstrate with evidence that H(2)S supplementation prevents HHcy-associated renal damage, in part, through its antioxidant properties."
19435365,0,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Mutations that increase DNA binding by the processivity factor of herpes simplex virus affect virus production and DNA replication fidelity.,"The interactions of the herpes simplex virus processivity factor UL42 with the catalytic subunit of the viral polymerase (Pol) and DNA are critical for viral DNA replication. Previous studies, including one showing that substitution of glutamine residue 282 with arginine (Q282R) results in an increase of DNA binding in vitro, have indicated that the positively charged back surface of UL42 interacts with DNA. To investigate the biological consequences of increased DNA binding by UL42 mutations, we constructed two additional UL42 mutants, including one with a double substitution of alanine for aspartic acid residues (D270A/D271A) and a triple mutant with the D270A/D271A and Q282R substitutions. These UL42 mutants exhibited increased and prolonged DNA binding without an effect on binding to a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of Pol. Plasmids expressing any of the three UL42 mutants with an increased positive charge on the back surface of UL42 were qualitatively competent for complementation of growth and DNA replication of a UL42 null mutant on Vero cells. We then engineered viruses expressing these mutant proteins. The UL42 mutants were more resistant to detergent extraction than wild-type UL42, suggesting that they are more tightly associated with DNA in infected cells. All three UL42 mutants formed smaller plaques on Vero cells and replicated to reduced yields compared with results for a control virus expressing wild-type UL42. Moreover, mutants with double and triple mutations, which contain D270A/D271A mutations, exhibited increased mutation frequencies, and mutants containing the Q282R mutation exhibited elevated ratios of virion DNA copies per PFU. These results suggest that herpes simplex virus has evolved so that UL42 neither binds DNA too tightly nor too weakly to optimize virus production and replication fidelity."
19435387,0,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Novel ring structure in the gp41 trimer of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that modulates sensitivity and resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies.,"The identification of the determinants of sensitivity and resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies is a high priority for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) research. An analysis of the swarm of closely related envelope protein variants in an HIV-infected individual revealed a mutation that markedly affected sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies and antiviral entry inhibitors targeting both gp41 and gp120. This mutation mapped to the C34 helix of gp41 and disrupted an unexplored structural feature consisting of a ring of hydrogen bonds in the gp41 trimer. This mutation appeared to affect the assembly of the six-helix bundle required for virus fusion and to alter the conformational equilibria so as to favor the prehairpin intermediate conformation required for the binding of the membrane proximal external region-specific neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 and the antiviral drug enfuvirtide (Fuzeon). The &quot;swarm analysis&quot; method we describe furthers our understanding of the relationships among the structure, function, and antigenicity of the HIV envelope protein and represents a new approach to the identification of vaccine antigens."
19435460,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein plays a major role in induction of the fish innate immune response against RNA and DNA viruses.,"Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through cellular sensor molecules which activate multiple signaling cascades that induce the production of interferons (IFN) and other cytokines. The recent identification of mammalian cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and their mitochondrial adaptor, the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), also called IPS-1, VISA, and Cardif, highlights the significance of these molecules in the induction of IFN. Teleost fish also possess a strong IFN system, but nothing is known concerning the RLRs and their downstream adaptor. In this study, we cloned MAVS cDNAs from several fish species (including salmon and zebrafish) and showed that they were orthologs of mammalian MAVS. We demonstrated that overexpression of these mitochondrial proteins in fish cells led to a constitutive induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). MAVS-overexpressing cells were almost fully protected against RNA virus infection, with a strong inhibition of both DNA and RNA virus replication (1,000- and 10,000-fold decreases, respectively). Analyses of MAVS deletion mutants showed that both the N-terminal CARD-like and C-terminal transmembrane domains, but not the central proline-rich region, were indispensable for MAVS signaling function. In addition, we cloned the cDNAs encoding a RIG-I-like molecule from salmonid and cyprinid cell lines. Like the case with MAVS, overexpression of RIG-I CARDs in fish cells led to a strong induction of both IFN and ISGs, conferring on fish cells full protection against RNA virus infection. This report provides the first demonstration that teleost fish possess a functional RLR pathway in which MAVS may play a central role in the induction of the innate immune response."
19435504,0,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Human bocavirus can be cultured in differentiated human airway epithelial cells.,"In 2005, a human bocavirus was discovered in children with respiratory tract illnesses. Attempts to culture this virus on conventional cell lines has failed thus far. We investigated whether the virus can replicate on pseudostratified human airway epithelium. This cell culture system mimics the human airway environment and facilitates culturing of various respiratory agents. The cells were inoculated with human bocavirus-positive nasopharyngeal washes from children, and virus replication was monitored by measuring apical release of the virus via real-time PCR. Furthermore, we identified different viral mRNAs in the infected cells. All mRNAs were transcribed from a single promoter but varied due to alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, similar to what has been described for bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, the other two members of the Bocavirus genus. Thus, transcription of human bocavirus displays strong homology to the transcription of the other bocaviruses. In conclusion, we report here for the first time that human bocavirus can be propagated in an in vitro culture system and present a detailed map of the set of mRNAs that are produced by the virus."
19435511,0,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Loss of MicroRNA targets in the 3' untranslated region as a mechanism of retroviral insertional activation of growth factor independence 1.,"The non-oncogene-bearing retrovirus SL3-3 murine leukemia virus induces strictly T-cell lymphomas with a mean latency of 2 to 4 months in mice of the NMRI-inbred (NMRI-i) strain. By high-throughput sequencing of retroviral tags, we have identified the genomic region carrying the transcriptional repressor and oncogene growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) as a frequent target for SL3-3 in the NMRI-i mouse genome. Twenty-four SL3-3 insertions were identified within a 1-kb window of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the Gfi1 gene, a clustering pattern unique for this lymphoma model. Expression analysis determined that the Gfi1 gene was transcriptionally activated by SL3-3 insertions, and an upregulation of Gfi1 protein expression was detected for tumors harboring insertions in the Gfi1 3'UTR. Here we provide data in support of a mechanism by which retroviral insertions in the Gfi1 3'UTR decouple microRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation."
19435804,0,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,IRSS: a web-based tool for automatic layout and analysis of IRES secondary structure prediction and searching system in silico.,"BACKGROUND: Internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) provide alternative, cap-independent translation initiation sites in eukaryotic cells. IRES elements are important factors in viral genomes and are also useful tools for bi-cistronic expression vectors. Most existing RNA structure prediction programs are unable to deal with IRES elements. RESULTS: We designed an IRES search system, named IRSS, to obtain better results for IRES prediction. RNA secondary structure prediction and comparison software programs were implemented to construct our two-stage strategy for the IRSS. Two software programs formed the backbone of IRSS: the RNAL fold program, used to predict local RNA secondary structures by minimum free energy method; and the RNA Align program, used to compare predicted structures. After complete viral genome database search, the IRSS have low error rate and up to 72.3% sensitivity in appropriated parameters. CONCLUSION: IRSS is freely available at this website http://140.135.61.9/ires/. In addition, all source codes, precompiled binaries, examples and documentations are downloadable for local execution. This new search approach for IRES elements will provide a useful research tool on IRES related studies."
19435845,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,23-Residue C-terminal alpha-helix governs kinetic cooperativity in monomeric human glucokinase.,"Human glucokinase is a monomeric enzyme that displays a sigmoidal steady-state kinetic response toward increasing glucose concentrations. The allosteric regulation produced by glucose is postulated to arise from the slow interconversion of multiple enzyme conformations during the course of catalysis. Crystallographic data suggest that structural rearrangements linked to glucokinase cooperativity involve a substrate-induced repositioning of an alpha-helix (alpha13) located at the C-terminus of the polypeptide. Here, we show that removal of helix alpha13 abolishes cooperativity and restores Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while reducing the k(cat) value of the wild-type enzyme by 160-fold. The impaired catalytic activity of the truncated enzyme is not rescued by the trans addition of a synthetic alpha13 peptide. Unexpectedly, the K(m glucose) value of a glucokinase variant lacking alpha13 is equivalent to the K(0.5 glucose) value of the full-length enzyme. Glucokinase steady-state kinetics is unaffected by the elongation of alpha13 via the addition of a C-terminal polyalanine tail. To explore the link between cooperativity and the primary sequence of alpha13, we randomized seven residues within the helix core. Genetic selection experiments in a glucokinase-deficient bacterium identified a variety of hyperactive alpha13 variants that display lower K(0.5 glucose) values, Hill coefficients near unity, and enhanced equilibrium binding affinities for glucose. The present results demonstrate that alpha13 plays an essential role in facilitating cooperativity. Our findings also establish a link between the primary amino acid sequence of helix alpha13 and the functional dynamics of the glucokinase scaffold that are required for allostery."
19435847,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Metal dependence of oxalate decarboxylase activity.,"Bacillus subtilis oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) catalyzes the conversion of oxalate into CO(2) and formate. The enzyme is composed of two cupin domains, each of which contains a Mn(II) ion. Although there is general agreement that Mn(II) in the N-terminal domain mediates OxDC-catalyzed decarboxylation, legitimate questions have been raised concerning the function (if any) of the Mn(II) bound in the C-terminal cupin domain. We have investigated this problem using a series of OxDC mutants in which Mn(II) binding is perturbed by mutagenesis of Glu-101 and Glu-280, which coordinate the metal in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. We now demonstrate that decarboxylase activity and total manganese content are sensitive to modifications in either metal-binding glutamate residue. These findings, in combination with EPR measurements, raise the possibility that the C-terminal Mn(II) center can catalyze the decarboxylation reaction. Further support for this conclusion has been provided from a combination of in vivo and in vitro strategies for preparing wild-type OxDC in which Mn(II) is incorporated to a variety of extents. Kinetic characterization of these variants shows that OxDC activity is linearly correlated with manganese content, as might be expected if both sites can catalyze the breakdown of oxalate into formate and CO(2). These studies also represent the first unequivocal demonstration that OxDC activity is uniquely mediated by manganese."
19435883,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Shape control of Al nanoclusters by ligand size.,"It is a challenge to synthesize clusters having a certain shape associated with a desirable property. In this study, we perform density functional calculations on ligand-protected Al(7) and Al(77) clusters. It is found that small ligands such as NH(2) still prefer the compact structure of bare Al clusters. However, large ligands such as N(SiMe(3))(2) stabilize the experimentally observed shell-like structures due to the steric effect. This is different from the Ga(84) cluster case where small ligands can stabilize the experimental shell-like Ga(84) cluster. Our study suggests that the shape, and thus the properties, of clusters (for instance, C(3v) Al(7) cluster has a finite dipole moment in contrast to the centrosymmetric D(3d) cluster) can be controlled by using ligands with different sizes."
19435884,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Gamma-agostic species as key intermediates in the vinyl addition polymerization of norbornene with cationic (allyl)Pd catalysts: synthesis and mechanistic insights.,"Several cationic (allyl)Pd(II) complexes were synthesized and shown to be highly active for (2,3)-vinyl addition polymerization of norbornene (NB) to yield polymers with low molecular weight distributions (MWDs) ranging from 1.2-1.4. Despite the low MWDs, slow initiation was followed by rapid propagation preventing molecular weight control of the poly(norbornene). Several intermediates in these polymerizations initiated with [(2-R-allyl)Pd(mesitylene)](+) complexes were fully characterized (NMR and X-ray diffraction). Consistent with previous observations the allyl and NB units couple in cis-exo fashion to yield a sigma,pi-complex capped by mesitylene. Mesitylene is readily displaced by NB to form an agostic intermediate in which NB acts as a bidentate ligand and binds to the cationic Pd center via the pi-system and a gamma-agostic interaction with the syn hydrogen at C7. The identity of this complex was established by NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It is significant since it suggests bidentate binding of NB in the propagating species, which cannot be observed by NMR spectroscopy. The NMR studies suggest that the second insertion, i.e., insertion of NB in the agostic intermediate, is the slow initiation step and the subsequent insertions are extremely fast. Therefore, slow chelate opening is the major limitation preventing a living polymerization. This hypothesis was explored using a series of cationic substituted pi-allyl complexes; significantly increased reactivity was observed when electron-withdrawing groups were introduced into the allyl moiety. However, despite these modifications initiation remained slow relative to chain propagation."
19435912,0,Protein Sci.,9211750,2009,Evolutionary constraints on structural similarity in orthologs and paralogs.,"Although a quantitative relationship between sequence similarity and structural similarity has long been established, little is known about the impact of orthology on the relationship between protein sequence and structure. Among homologs, orthologs (derived by speciation) more frequently have similar functions than paralogs (derived by duplication). Here, we hypothesize that an orthologous pair will tend to exhibit greater structural similarity than a paralogous pair at the same level of sequence similarity. To test this hypothesis, we used 284,459 pairwise structure-based alignments of 12,634 unique domains from SCOP as well as orthology and paralogy assignments from OrthoMCL DB. We divided the comparisons by sequence identity and determined whether the sequence-structure relationship differed between the orthologs and paralogs. We found that at levels of sequence identity between 30 and 70%, orthologous domain pairs indeed tend to be significantly more structurally similar than paralogous pairs at the same level of sequence identity. An even larger difference is found when comparing ligand binding residues instead of whole domains. These differences between orthologs and paralogs are expected to be useful for selecting template structures in comparative modeling and target proteins in structural genomics."
19435921,0,Protein Sci.,9211750,2009,"Design, generation, and testing of mammalian expression modules that tag membrane proteins.","The expression of mammalian membrane proteins in laboratory cell lines allows their biological functions to be characterized and carefully dissected. However, it is often difficult to design and generate effective antibodies for membrane proteins in the desired studies. As a result, expressed membrane proteins cannot be detected or characterized via common biochemical approaches such as western blotting, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemical analysis, and their cellular behaviors cannot be sufficiently investigated. To circumvent such roadblocks, we designed and generated two sets of expression modules that consist of sequences encoding for three essential components: (1) a signal peptide from human receptor for advanced glycation end products that targets the intended protein to the endoplasmic reticulum for cell surface expression; (2) an antigenic epitope tag that elicits specific antibody recognition; and (3) a series of restriction sites that facilitate subcloning of the target membrane protein. The modules were designed with the flexibility to change the epitope tag to suit the specific tagging needs. The modules were subcloned into expression vectors, and were successfully tested with both Type I and Type III human membrane proteins: the receptor for advanced glycation end products, the Toll-like receptor 4, and the angiotensin II receptor 1. These expressed membrane proteins are readily detected by western blotting, and are immunoprecipitated by antibodies to their relative epitope tags. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses also show that the expressed proteins are located at cell surface, and maintain their modifications and biological functions. Thus, the designed modules serve as an effective tool that facilitates biochemical studies of membrane proteins."

This prevents chromophore maturation and the cells lack GFP fluorescence. We have utilized the very high affinity between the two EF-hands of calbindin D(9k) to facilitate GFP assembly from its fragments and to introduce a calcium dependent molecular switch. In GFPN-EF1, residues 1-157 of GFP are fused to residues 1-43 of calbindin, and in EF2-GFPC, residues 44-75 of calbindin are fused to residues 158-238 of GFP. When co-expressed, GFPN-EF1 and EF2-GFPC associate spontaneously and rapidly resulting in a folded reconstituted protein with bright GFP fluorescence. The high affinity of GFPN-EF1 for EF2-GFPC leads to brighter fluorescence of the cells compared to cells with a control constructs carrying leucine zippers (Wilson et al., Nature Methods 2004;3:255). The complex of GFPN-EF1 and EF2-GFPC was purified from cells using metal-ion chelate chromatography and the temperature dependence of GFP fluorescence was found to be calcium dependent. The GFPN-EF1 and EF2-GFPC fragments were separated by ion exchange chromatography. The assembly of the fragments was found to be reversible and the complex was regained upon mixing, as evidenced by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data. The affinity between GFPN-EF1 and EF2-GFPC as well as rates of association and dissociation were found to be Ca(2+)-dependent."

Yet, in evolution, spoken language must have emerged from neural mechanisms at least partially available in animals. In this paper, we will demonstrate how our understanding of speech perception, one important facet of language, has profited from findings and theory in nonhuman primate studies. Chief among these are physiological and anatomical studies showing that primate auditory cortex, across species, shows patterns of hierarchical structure, topographic mapping and streams of functional processing. We will identify roles for different cortical areas in the perceptual processing of speech and review functional imaging work in humans that bears on our understanding of how the brain decodes and monitors speech. A new model connects structures in the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes linking speech perception and production."
19436261,0,Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,9113221,2009,Neural ganglioside GD2 identifies a subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells in umbilical cord.,"In contrast to hematopoietic stem cells, there is still a lack of definitive cell markers for specific isolation and identification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Thus a homogenous population of MSCs is only obtained after several passages, when multilineage potential or other distinctive features of very early progenitors may be already somewhat compromised. Recently a novel surface marker the neural ganglioside GD2 has been reported to distinguish MSCs from all other cells within marrow. Here, we found that MSCs derived from umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) also expressed this marker at early-passages. More importantly, UC-MSCs were the only cells within umbilical cord expressing this marker. Compared to unsorted cells, GD2(+)-sorted cells not only possessed much higher clonogenicity and proliferation capacity but also had significantly stronger multi-differentiation potentials. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GD2(+)-sorted cells showed increased expression of SSEA-4, Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog, the typical markers expressed in embryonic stem cells, in comparison to unsorted or GD2-negative MSCs. Take together, our data demonstrate that the cells selected by GD2 are a subpopulation of MSCs with feature of primitive precursor cells and provide evidence that GD2 can be a cell surface marker suitable for the isolation and purification of UC-MSCs in early-passage culture."
19436296,0,Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,9113221,2009,Purinergic receptors stimulate Na+/Ca2+ exchange in pancreatic duct cells: possible role of proteins handling and transporting Ca2+.,"Most purinergic receptors activate intracellular Ca(2+) signalling, and in epithelia they stimulate transport of major ions. Aim of the present study on pancreatic ducts was to find whether P2 receptors also regulate cellular Ca(2+) transport, such as that via the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). Since NCX can also be connected with epithelial Ca(2+) transport, we also investigated expression of some Ca(2+)-handling/transporting proteins. Expression analysis revealed that pancreatic ducts of rat and human duct cell line CFPAC-1 (also PANC-1 and Capan-1) express the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (splice variants NCX1.3 and 1.7), as well as the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor and the Ca(2+)-binding protein calbindin-D 9k. These proteins localize to the luminal and lateral membranes of pancreatic duct epithelia. Ca(2+) imaging experiments showed that activation of purinergic P2Y and P2X receptors stimulated NCX in human and rat duct cells. Application of ATP to CFPAC-1 monolayers also stimulated Ca(2+) transport from the luminal to the basolateral side. Taken together, these results show that pancreatic ducts express a number of Ca(2+)-handling/transporting proteins and we propose that these together with purinergic receptors play a role in regulation of duct lumen Ca(2+) content."
19436298,0,Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,9113221,2009,Crucial role of interleukin-6 in the development of norepinephrine-induced left ventricular remodeling in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Elevated serum concentration of interleukin (IL)-6 is a predictor for poor prognosis in congestive heart failure. It was shown previously in rats, that IL-6 expression in the left ventricle (LV) was followed by LV hypertrophy. METHODS: Using IL-6 deficient mice (IL-6(-/-)), we studied the role of IL-6 in a model of norepinephrine (NE)-induced LV hypertrophy. RESULTS: In wild type (WT) mice, IL-6 mRNA expression and its concentration in the serum were elevated after 4 h of NE-treatment (s.c. 0.25 mg.h)./kg Further, NE-induced LV hypertrophy was detected: LV weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio (+12.3+/-3%, p &lt; 0.05) and mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in WT mice (+120+/-25%, p &lt; 0.05) after 3 days were increased. In contrast, NE did not induce elevation of LVW/BW ratio and ANP expression in IL-6(-/-) mice. Replacement with recombinant IL-6 restored the hypertrophy-inducing effect of NE in IL-6(-/-) mice. As to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, NE increased collagen type I and III expression only in WT mice and not in IL-6(-/-) mice. The addition of recombinant IL-6 elevated the expression of the ECM proteins to the WT level. CONCLUSION: IL-6 is a major player in the development of NE-induced LV hypertrophy in mice."

Biochem.,9113221,2009,N-4-tert-butyl benzyl haloperidol chloride suppresses Ca2+-dependent Egr-1 expression and subsequently inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation induced by angiotensin II.,"BACKGROUND: N-4-Tert-Butyl benzyl haloperidol chloride (C(3)) was a novel calcium antagonist synthesized in our laboratory. The present study is to explore the effect of C(3) on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and the mechanism involved. METHODS: The effects of C(3) on Ang II-induced cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration change, VSMC proliferation, the key early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1) were evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy, microtiter tetrazolium (MTT) proliferation assay, flow cytometry analysis, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. An extracellular Ca(2+) chelator EGTA and antisense Egr-1 oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) were used to establish the relation between Ca(2+)-dependent Egr-1 expression induced by Ang II and VSMC proliferation. RESULTS: C(3) attenuated the Ang II-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx, inhibited VSMCs proliferation and arrested VSMCs in G(1)-phase. C(3) also triggered a significant reduction in PDGF-A and cyclin D1, Cdk2 along with an overexpression of p21Cip1. Antisense Egr-1 ODNs inhibited VSMCs proliferation, which was related to G(1)-phase arrest, due to inhibiting the expression of Egr-1 and C(3) inhibited the overexpression of Egr-1. CONCLUSION: Egr-1 may play a key role in Ang II-induced proliferation of VSMCs. C(3) inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and the mechanism is involved with the inhibition of over-expression of Egr-1."
19436711,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Critical role for caspase-8 in epidermal growth factor signaling.,"Caspase-8 has a well-defined canonical role as an apical protease of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Evidence is growing, however, that the protein has numerous other nonapoptotic functions. We have previously shown that caspase-8 is required for efficient adhesion-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-1/2 pathway. We now show that caspase-8 is also necessary for the efficient activation of downstream events associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. This promotion of EGF-induced Erk1/2 activation is independent of the proteolytic activity of caspase-8 and can be recapitulated using only the pro-domains of the protein. In addition, we identify specific residues within the caspase-8 &quot;RXDLL motif&quot; that are essential for Erk pathway activation. Furthermore, these residues are also involved in forming a complex with the tyrosine kinase Src. Caspase-8 null cells and cells reconstituted with caspase-8 harboring point mutations of these critical amino acids also show defective EGF-induced migration as compared with cells reconstituted with the wild-type protein. In sum, we provide the first evidence for caspase-8 as an essential component of growth factor signaling and suggest that this may be due to its association with Src. As the EGF/Src pathway activity has been shown to promote oncogenic events, our findings that caspase-8 is necessary for these activities may help explain why it is rarely deleted or silenced in tumors."
19436724,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,The transcriptional activity of Sox9 in chondrocytes is regulated by RhoA signaling and actin polymerization.,"In this study, we demonstrate that dedifferentiation of round primary chondrocytes into a fibroblast morphology correlates with a profound induction of RhoA protein and stress fibers. Culture of dedifferentiated chondrocytes in alginate gel induces a precipitous loss of RhoA protein and a loss of stress fibers concomitant with the reexpression of the chondrocyte differentiation program. We have found that chondrogenesis in limb bud micromass cultures similarly entails a loss of RhoA protein and that expression of dominant negative RhoA in such cultures can markedly enhance chondrogenesis. Consistent with these results, expression of the Rho antagonist C3 transferase can restore chondrocyte gene expression in dedifferentiated chondrocytes grown on plastic. Transfection of cells with agents that block actin polymerization enhance the ability of either exogenous Sox9 or a Gal4 DBD-Sox9 fusion protein to activate gene expression. Interestingly, the enhancement of Sox9 function by actin depolymerization requires both protein kinase A (PKA) activity and a PKA phosphorylation site in Sox9 (S181) that is known to enhance Sox9 transcriptional activity. Lastly, we demonstrate that RhoA-mediated modulation of actin polymerization regulates the ability of Sox9 to both activate chondrocyte-specific markers and maintain its own expression in chondrocytes via a positive feedback loop."
19436739,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,SIRT1 promotes cell survival under stress by deacetylation-dependent deactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1.,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and SIRT1 deacetylase are two NAD-dependent enzymes which play major roles in the decision of a cell to live or to die in a stress situation. Because of the dependence of both enzymes on NAD, cross talk between them has been suggested. Here, we show that PARP1 is acetylated after stress of cardiomyocytes, resulting in the activation of PARP1, which is independent of DNA damage. SIRT1 physically binds to and deacetylates PARP1. Increased acetylation of PARP1 was also detected in hearts of SIRT1(-/-) mice, compared to that detected in the hearts of SIRT1(+/+) mice, confirming a role of SIRT1 in regulating the PARP1 acetylation in vivo. SIRT1-dependent deacetylation blocks PARP1 activity, and it protects cells from PARP1-mediated cell death. We also show that SIRT1 negatively regulates the activity of the PARP1 gene promoter, thus suggesting that the deacetylase controls the PARP1 activity at the transcriptional level as well. These data demonstrate that the activity of PARP1 is under the control of SIRT1, which is necessary for survival of cells under stress conditions."
19436748,1,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Serine protease HtrA1 associates with microtubules and inhibits cell migration.,"HtrA1 belongs to a family of serine proteases found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Bacterial HtrA1 (DegP) is a heat shock-induced protein that behaves as a chaperone at low temperature and as a protease at high temperature to help remove unfolded proteins during heat shock. In contrast to bacterial HtrA1, little is known about the function of human HtrA1. Here, we report the first evidence that human HtrA1 is a microtubule-associated protein and modulates microtubule stability and cell motility. Intracellular HtrA1 is localized to microtubules in a PDZ (PSD95, Dlg, ZO1) domain-dependent, nocodazole-sensitive manner. During microtubule assembly, intracellular HtrA associates with centrosomes and newly polymerized microtubules. In vitro, purified HtrA1 promotes microtubule assembly. Moreover, HtrA1 cosediments and copurifies with microtubules. Purified HtrA1 associates with purified alpha- and beta-tubulins, and immunoprecipitation of endogenous HtrA1 results in coprecipitation of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulins. Finally, downregulation of HtrA1 promotes cell motility, whereas enhanced expression of HtrA1 attenuates cell motility. These results offer an original identification of HtrA1 as a microtubule-associated protein and provide initial mechanistic insights into the role of HtrA1 in the regulation of cell motility by modulating microtubule stability."
19436756,0,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,Plant-pathogen interactions and elevated CO2: morphological changes in favour of pathogens.,"Crop losses caused by pests and weeds have been estimated at 42% worldwide, with plant pathogens responsible for almost $10 billion worth of damage in the USA in 1994 alone. Elevated carbon dioxide [ECO(2)] and associated climate change have the potential to accelerate plant pathogen evolution, which may, in turn, affect virulence. Plant-pathogen interactions under increasing CO(2) concentrations have the potential to disrupt both agricultural and natural systems severely, yet the lack of experimental data and the subsequent ability to predict future outcomes constitutes a fundamental knowledge gap. Furthermore, nothing is known about the mechanistic bases of increasing pathogen agressiveness. In the absence of information on crop species, it is shown here that plant pathogen (Erysiphe cichoracearum) aggressiveness is increased under ECO(2), together with changes in the leaf epidermal characteristics of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Stomatal density, guard cell length, and trichome numbers on leaves developing post-infection are increased under ECO(2) in direct contrast to non-infected responses. As many plant pathogens utilize epidermal features for successful infection, these responses provide a positive feedback mechanism facilitating an enhanced susceptibility of newly developed leaves to further pathogen attack. Furthermore, a screen of resistant and susceptible ecotypes suggest inherent differences in epidermal responses to ECO(2)."
19437566,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,"Remorin, a solanaceae protein resident in membrane rafts and plasmodesmata, impairs potato virus X movement.","Remorins (REMs) are proteins of unknown function specific to vascular plants. We have used imaging and biochemical approaches and in situ labeling to demonstrate that REM clusters at plasmodesmata and in approximately 70-nm membrane domains, similar to lipid rafts, in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. From a manipulation of REM levels in transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants, we show that Potato virus X (PVX) movement is inversely related to REM accumulation. We show that REM can interact physically with the movement protein TRIPLE GENE BLOCK PROTEIN1 from PVX. Based on the localization of REM and its impact on virus macromolecular trafficking, we discuss the potential for lipid rafts to act as functional components in plasmodesmata and the plasma membrane."
19437573,0,J. Cell. Sci.,52457,2009,Integrin alpha9beta1 mediates enhanced cell migration through nitric oxide synthase activity regulated by Src tyrosine kinase.,"Integrins are important mediators of cell adhesion and migration, which in turn are essential for diverse biological functions, including wound healing and cancer metastasis. The integrin alpha9beta1 is expressed on numerous mammalian tissues and can mediate accelerated cell migration. As the molecular signaling mechanisms that transduce this effect are poorly defined, we investigated the pathways by which activated integrin alpha9beta1 signals migration. We found for the first time that specific ligation of integrin alpha9beta1 rapidly activates Src tyrosine kinase, with concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and activation of Rac-1. Furthermore, activation of integrin alpha9beta1 also enhanced NO production through activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Inhibition of Src tyrosine kinase or NOS decreased integrin-alpha9beta1-dependent cell migration. Src appeared to function most proximal in the signaling cascade, in a FAK-independent manner to facilitate iNOS activation and NO-dependent cell migration. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin alpha9 was crucial for integrin-alpha9beta1-induced Src activation, subsequent signaling events and cell migration. When taken together, our results describe a novel and unique mechanism of coordinated interactions of the integrin alpha9 cytoplasmic domain, Src tyrosine kinase and iNOS to transduce integrin-alpha9beta1-mediated cell migration."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Sulfur cycling and methanogenesis primarily drive microbial colonization of the highly sulfidic Urania deep hypersaline basin.,"Urania basin in the deep Mediterranean Sea houses a lake that is &gt;100 m deep, devoid of oxygen, 6 times more saline than seawater, and has very high levels of methane and particularly sulfide (up to 16 mM), making it among the most sulfidic water bodies on Earth. Along the depth profile there are 2 chemoclines, a steep one with the overlying oxic seawater, and another between anoxic brines of different density, where gradients of salinity, electron donors and acceptors occur. To identify and differentiate the microbes and processes contributing to the turnover of organic matter and sulfide along the water column, these chemoclines were sampled at a high resolution. Bacterial cell numbers increased up to a hundredfold in the chemoclines as a consequence of elevated nutrient availability, with higher numbers in the upper interface where redox gradient was steeper. Bacterial and archaeal communities, analyzed by DNA fingerprinting, 16S rRNA gene libraries, activity measurements, and cultivation, were highly stratified and metabolically more active along the chemoclines compared with seawater or the uniformly hypersaline brines. Detailed analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that in both chemoclines delta- and epsilon-Proteobacteria, predominantly sulfate reducers and sulfur oxidizers, respectively, were the dominant bacteria. In the deepest layers of the basin MSBL1, putatively responsible for methanogenesis, dominated among archaea. The data suggest that the complex microbial community is adapted to the basin's extreme chemistry, and the elevated biomass is driven largely by sulfur cycling and methanogenesis."
19438238,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Bam and Bgcn antagonize Nanos-dependent germ-line stem cell maintenance.,"The balance between germ-line stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and differentiation in Drosophila ovaries is mediated by the antagonistic relationship between the Nanos (Nos)-Pumilio translational repressor complex, which promotes GSC self-renewal, and expression of Bam, a key differentiation factor. Here, we find that Bam and Nos proteins are expressed in reciprocal patterns in young germ cells. Repression of Nos in Bam-expressing cells depends on sequences in the nos 3'-UTR, suggesting that Nos is regulated by translational repression. Ectopic Bam causes differentiation of GSCs, and this activity depends on the endogenous nos 3'-UTR sequence. Previous evidence showed that Bgcn is an obligate factor for the ability of Bam to drive differentiation, and we now report that Bam forms a complex with Bgcn, a protein related to the RNA-interacting DExH-box polypeptides. Together, these observations suggest that Bam-Bgcn act together to antagonize Nos expression; thus, derepressing cystoblast-promoting factors. These findings emphasize the importance of translational repression in balancing stem cell self-renewal and differentiation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Mirroring of attention by neurons in macaque parietal cortex.,"Macaques, like humans, rapidly orient their attention in the direction other individuals are looking. Both cortical and subcortical pathways have been proposed as neural mediators of social gaze following, but neither pathway has been characterized electrophysiologically in behaving animals. To address this gap, we recorded the activity of single neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of rhesus macaques to determine whether and how this area might contribute to gaze following. A subset of LIP neurons mirrored observed attention by firing both when the subject looked in the preferred direction of the neuron, and when observed monkeys looked in the preferred direction of the neuron, despite the irrelevance of the monkey images to the task. Importantly, the timing of these modulations matched the time course of gaze-following behavior. A second population of neurons was suppressed by social gaze cues, possibly subserving task demands by maintaining fixation on the observed face. These observations suggest that LIP contributes to sharing of observed attention and link mirror representations in parietal cortex to a well studied imitative behavior."

Amacrine cells, a class of interneurons, are thought to mediate much of the processing of the visual signal that occurs within the retina. Although amacrine cells display extensive morphological diversity, the molecular nature of this diversity is largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not known how this diversity arises during development. Here, we have combined in vivo genetic labeling, single cell genome-wide expression profiling, and classical birthdating to (i) identify specific molecular types of amacrine cells, (ii) demonstrate the molecular diversity of the amacrine cell class, and (iii) show that amacrine cell diversity arises at least in part through temporal patterning."

Here, we show that dopamine-dependent accumulation of alpha-synuclein in cultured cells results in apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway can rescue alpha-synuclein toxicity and suppress alpha-synuclein aggregation through the activation of PI3K/Akt pathways. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of IGF-1 pathway in Parkinson disease."
19439258,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,HSP60 interacts with YB-1 and affects its polysome association and subcellular localization.,"YB-1 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein which, in the cytoplasm, associates with polysomes and regulates translation. However, YB-1 has a novel nuclear localization signal, and its nuclear accumulation is correlated with cancer induction. Here we designated the amino-acid sequence as YB-NLS and demonstrated that YB-NLS is necessary for the nuclear translocation of overexpressed YB-1 in NG108-15 cells. In addition, we found that a heat shock protein, HSP60, binds to YB-NLS in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, when HSP60 expression was repressed, an increase of polysome-associated YB-1 was observed in heavy-sedimenting fractions on a sucrose gradient. Overexpression of HSP60 resulted in a decrease of YB-1 in the heavy-sedimenting fractions and suppression of YB-NLS activity. Furthermore, the NLS-deleted YB-1 was apparently associated with the heavy-sedimenting polysomes. These results suggest that HSP60 interacts with YB-1 at the YB-NLS region and acts as a regulator of polysome association and the subcellular distribution of YB-1."

Soc.,7503056,2009,A new perovskite polytype in the high-pressure sequence of BaIrO(3).,"The high-pressure sequence of the perovskite polytypes of BaIrO(3) has been investigated in the pressure range up to 10 GPa. At ambient pressure the so-called &quot;9R&quot; polytype has been prepared by solid-state reaction and slow cooling in air to yield an almost fully oxygen-stoichiometric BaIrO(2.96(1)) composition. The crystal structure has been refined from XRD data in the monoclinic C2/m space group with a = 10.0046(3) A, b = 5.75362(14) A, c = 15.1839(4) A, beta = 103.27(1) degrees ; it contains trimers of face-sharing octahedra (or Ir(3)O(12) trioctahedra) that are linked by their vertices to form columns parallel to the c-axis with a stacking of layers of corner sharing (c) and face sharing (h) IrO(6) octahedra along the sequence hhchhc. This structure is stable up to 3 GPa; at 4 GPa a new 5H polytype has been stabilized as a pure phase. The crystal structure has been solved by ab initio procedures from powder XRD data. It is monoclinic with a = 9.9511(2) A, b = 5.7503(1) A, c = 13.71003(3) A, beta = 118.404(2) degrees , and it was refined in the C2/m space group from NPD data collected at room temperature. This polytype can be described as a stacking of IrO(6) octahedra along the sequence hchcc. The structure contains chains of double dimer units of face-sharing octahedra; the twin dimers are connected to single layers of vertex-sharing octahedra, forming infinite chains along c. This is a unique stacking that, with this repetition length, has never been described before among the hexagonal polytypes of ABO(3) perovskites. The 5H polytype is stable in a narrow pressure range; at 5 GPa the 6H structure is formed, stable up to 10 GPa. The 6H-BaIrO(3) polytype is monoclinic, space group C2/c, with a = 5.7483(2) A, b = 9.9390(3) A, c = 14.3582(5) A, beta = 91.319(2) degrees . The structure consists of dimers of face-sharing octahedra separated by single corner-sharing octahedra, showing the sequence hcchcc along the c-axis. At 10 GPa the cubic 3C perovskite structure could be identified as a minority phase, with a = 4.0611(7) A, defined in the Pm3m space group. The precarious stability of the 5H polytype, as well as the novel pressure sequence displayed by BaIrO(3) that is distinct from the classical sequence 9R-4H-6H-3C exhibited by many transition metal oxides, for instance BaRuO(3), is a result of the particular stability of the &quot;9R&quot; ambient-pressure structure, which is reinforced by a strong Ir-Ir bond across the octahedral faces, and the Ir-Ir Coulombic repulsion across shared faces that destabilizes the 4H polytype relative to the 6H phase to allow stabilization of the hybrid 5H polytype in a narrow presure range."

Moreover, directed evolution studies allow us to learn more about how enzymes perform mechanistically. The present study concerns a previously evolved highly enantioselective mutant of the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger in the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of racemic glycidyl phenyl ether. Kinetic data, molecular dynamics calculations, molecular modeling, inhibition experiments, and X-ray structural work for the wild-type (WT) enzyme and the best mutant reveal the basis of the large increase in enantioselectivity (E = 4.6 versus E = 115). The overall structures of the WT and the mutant are essentially identical, but dramatic differences are observed in the active site as revealed by the X-ray structures. All of the experimental and computational results support a model in which productive positioning of the preferred (S)-glycidyl phenyl ether, but not the (R)-enantiomer, forms the basis of enhanced enantioselectivity. Predictions regarding substrate scope and enantioselectivity of the best mutant are shown to be possible."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Collagen targeting using protein-functionalized micelles: the strength of multiple weak interactions.,"Collagen is an important marker for the assessment of tissue remodeling, both in normal tissue maturation and in a variety of prevalent disease processes. Given the importance of multivalency in the natural interactions of collagen, multivalent ligands provide unique opportunities to target collagen architectures. Here, we explored the use of micelles as dynamic self-assembling multivalent scaffolds for the collagen binding protein CNA35. Despite the increased popularity of micelles as nanosized carriers in targeted drug delivery and molecular imaging, few studies have actually directly addressed the importance of multivalent interactions for micelle-based targeting. Native chemical ligation was used as a chemoselective and efficient method to prepare relatively well-defined and stable micelles with a tunable average protein content between 0 and 20 copies of CNA35 per micelle. The thermodynamics and kinetics of CNA35 micelle binding to collagen was studied using solid-phase and surface plasmon resonance assays. Multivalent interactions between the micelles and collagen had a remarkable effect on micellar stability, since no dissociation of collagen-bound micelles was observed even after extensive washing. In addition, an impressive enhancement of collagen affinity was observed both in vitro and ex vivo resulting from multivalent display of a so-called &quot;nonbinding&quot; variant of CNA35. This &quot;restoration&quot; of collagen affinity was subsequently also observed for liposomes displaying the same low-affinity CNA35 variant at a sufficient density. These results demonstrate the importance of multivalent interactions for micelle-based targeting and illustrate the strength of multiple weak interactions when targeting intrinsically multivalent extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen."

The influence of catalyst preparation, carbon functionalization, and catalyst morphology on the catalytic activity in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by means of spectroscopy (FT-IR, solid-state (13)C NMR, AAS, XPS), X-ray scattering (WAXS), surface area analysis (BET, methylene blue adsorption), and electron microscopy (TEM, ESEM).

19439479,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Gamma-radiation induced interstrand cross-links in PNA:DNA heteroduplexes.,"Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) efficiently hybridize with DNA and are promoted as versatile gene-targeting analytical tools and pharmaceuticals. However, PNAs have never been exploited as radiopharmaceuticals, and radiation-induced physicochemical modifications of PNA:DNA heteroduplexes have not been studied. Drug- and radiation-induced creation of covalent cross-links in DNA obstruct crucial cell survival processes such as transcription and replication and are thus considered genotoxic events with a high impact in anticancer therapies. Here we report that gamma-irradiation of complementary PNA:DNA heteroduplexes, wherein the PNA contains l-lysine, free amino, or N-methylmorpholinium N- and C-capping groups, results in the formation of irreversible interstrand cross-links (ICL). The number of detected ICL corresponds to the number of available amino functional groups on the PNA. The effect of DNA sequence on the formation of ICL was studied by modifying the terminal nucleotides of the DNA oligonucleotide to create deletions and overhangs. The involvement of abasic sites (ABS) on the DNA strand in the cross-linking reaction was confirmed by independent experiments with synthetic ABS-containing oligonucleotides. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to elucidate the conformation of the N- and C-capping groups of the PNA oligomer and their interactions with the proximal terminus of the DNA. Good agreement between experimental and modeling results was achieved. Modeling indicated that the presence of positively charged capping groups on the PNA increases the conformational flexibility of the PNA:DNA terminal base pairs and often leads to their melting. This disordered orientation of the duplex ends provides conditions for multiple encounters of the short (amino) and bulky (Lys) side chains with nucleobases and the DNA backbone up to the third base pair along the duplex stem. Dangling duplex ends offer favorable conditions for increased accessibility of the radiation-induced free radicals to terminal nucleotides and their damage. It is suggested that the ICL are produced by initial formation of Schiff base adducts between the PNA amino functions and the opposed DNA oxidation-damaged bases or abasic 2'-deoxyribose-derived aldehydic groups. The subsequent reduction by solvated electrons (e(-)(aq)) or other radiation-produced reducing species results in irreversible covalent interstrand cross-links. The simultaneous involvement of oxidizing, (*)OH, and reducing, e(-)(aq), radicals presents a case in which multiple ionization events along a gamma-particle path lead to DNA injuries that also encompass ICL as part of the multiply damaged sites (MDS). The obtained results may find applications in the development of a new generation of gene-targeted radiosensitizers based on PNA vectors."
19439571,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Checkpoint with forkhead-associated and ring finger promoter hypermethylation correlates with microsatellite instability in gastric cancer.,"AIM: To examine the methylation status of the promoter region of the checkpoint with forkhead-associated and ring finger (CHFR) and microsatellite mutator status in 59 primary gastric cancers. METHODS: We investigated the promoter methylation of CHFR in 59 cases of gastric cancer using methylation-specific PCR. Five microsatellite loci were analyzed using high-intensity microsatellite analysis reported previously, and p53 gene mutations were investigated by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty cases (33.9%) showed promoter methylation and no relation was observed with the clinicopathological factors. We found that the promoter methylation of CHFR was frequently accompanied with microsatellite instability (MIN). Seven of 20 (35.0%) cases showed MIN in hypermethylation of the CHFR tumor, while three of 39 (7.7%) cases showed MIN in the non-methylated CHFR tumor (P &lt; 0.01). However, we failed to find any relationship between CHFR methylation and p53 mutation status. CONCLUSION: The coordinated loss of both the mitotic check point function and mismatch repair system suggests the potential to overcome the cell cycle check point, which may lead to an accumulation of mutations. However, the p53 mutation was not related to hypermethylation of the CHFR promoter and MIN, which indicates that an abnormality in p53 occurs as an independent process from the mismatch repair deficiency in carcinogenesis."

Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Relationship between angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin II correlates with hemodynamic changes in human liver cirrhosis.,"AIM: To measure circulating angiotensins at different stages of human cirrhosis and to further evaluate a possible relationship between renin angiotensin system (RAS) components and hemodynamic changes. METHODS: Patients were allocated into 4 groups: mild-to-moderate liver disease (MLD), advanced liver disease (ALD), patients undergoing liver transplantation, and healthy controls. Blood was collected to determine plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) levels using radioimmunoassays. During liver transplantation, hemodynamic parameters were determined and blood was simultaneously obtained from the portal vein and radial artery in order to measure RAS components. RESULTS: PRA and angiotensins were elevated in ALD when compared to MLD and controls (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, Ang II was significantly reduced in MLD. Ang-(1-7)/Ang II ratios were increased in MLD when compared to controls and ALD. During transplantation, Ang II levels were lower and Ang-(1-7)/Ang II ratios were higher in the splanchnic circulation than in the peripheral circulation (0.52 +/- 0.08 vs 0.38 +/- 0.04, P &lt; 0.02), whereas the peripheral circulating Ang II/Ang I ratio was elevated in comparison to splanchnic levels (0.18 +/- 0.02 vs 0.13 +/- 0.02, P &lt; 0.04). Ang-(1-7)/Ang II ratios positively correlated with cardiac output (r = 0.66) and negatively correlated with systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.70). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the relationship between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II may play a role in the hemodynamic changes of human cirrhosis."

METHODS: The esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line (TE-13) was treated with different concentrations of nicotine (100 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL) or 200 microg/mL nicotine plus 100 micromol/L nimesulide. Cell migration and invasion were measured using migration and invasion chamber systems. COX-2 expression was determined by Western blotting. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was analyzed by zymography and ELISA. RESULTS: Nicotine (100 microg/mL, 200 microg/mL) enhanced TE-13 cells migration and invasion, and increased the protein expression of COX-2 and the activity of MMP-2. Nicotine (200 microg/mL) stimulated TE-13 cells migration and invasion which were partly blocked by nimesulide. This was associated with decreased protein expression of COX-2 and decreased activity and protein expression of MMP-2. CONCLUSION: Nicotine enhances the migration and invasion of the esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line, and nimesulide partly blocks the effect of nicotine-enhanced esophageal squamous carcinoma cell migration and invasion."
19439654,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Current prophylactic strategies against hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation.,"Prophylactic strategies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) are essential for patients with HBV-related disease. Before LT, lamivudine (LAM) was proposed to be down-graded from first- to second-line therapy. In contrast, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has been approved not only as first-line therapy but also as rescue therapy for patients with LAM resistance. Furthermore, combination of ADV and LAM may result in lower risk of ADV resistance than ADV monotherapy. Other new drugs such as entecavir, telbivudine and tenofovir, are probably candidates for the treatment of hepatitis-B-surface-antigen-positive patients awaiting LT. After LT, low-dose intramuscular hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), in combination with LAM, has been regarded as the most cost-effective regimen for the prevention of post-transplant HBV recurrence in recipients without pretransplant LAM resistance and rapidly accepted in many transplant centers. With the introduction of new antiviral drugs, new hepatitis B vaccine and its new adjuvants, post-transplant HBIG-free therapeutic regimens with new oral antiviral drug combinations or active HBV vaccination combined with adjuvants will be promising, particularly in those patients with low risk of HBV recurrence."
19439655,1,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Combined therapeutic approach: inflammatory bowel diseases and peripheral or axial arthritis.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are associated with a variety of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). About 36% of IBD patients have at least one EIM, which most frequently affect the joints, skin, eyes and the biliary tract. The EIMs associated with IBD have a negative impact on patients with UC and CD, and the resolution of most of them parallels that of the active IBD in terms of timing and required therapy; however, the clinical course of EIMs such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is independent of IBD activity. The peripheral and axial arthritis associated with IBD have traditionally been treated with simple analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, local steroid injections and physiotherapy, but the introduction of biological response modifiers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers, has led to further improvements."
19439658,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Enteropathic spondyloarthropathy: a common genetic background with inflammatory bowel disease?,"The association between spondyloarthropathy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is largely established, although prevalence is variable because of different population selection and diagnostic methodologies. Most studies indicate that as many as 10%-15% of cases of IBD are complicated by ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or other forms of spondylarthritis (SpA). Of note, ileal inflammation resembling IBD has been reported in up to two thirds of cases of SpA, and it has been suggested that the presence of ileitis is associated with the chronicity of articular complications. Although this observation is of interest to unravel the pathophysiology of the disease, systematic screening of patients with SpA by ileocolonoscopy is not indicated in the absence of gut symptoms, as only a small proportion of patients with subclinical gut inflammation will develop overt IBD over time. The existence of familial clustering of both IBD and AS, the coexistence of both conditions in a patient, the evidence of an increased risk ratio among first- and second-degree relatives of affected AS or IBD patients and finally, the increased cross-risk ratios between AS and IBD, strongly suggest a shared genetic background. So far, however, IL23R is the only identified susceptibility gene shared by both IBD and AS. Although functional studies are still needed to better understand its pathogenic role, great effort is being spent therapeutically targeting this pathway that may prove effective for both disorders."
19439661,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Dazl functions in maintenance of pluripotency and genetic and epigenetic programs of differentiation in mouse primordial germ cells in vivo and in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Mammalian germ cells progress through a unique developmental program that encompasses proliferation and migration of the nascent primordial germ cell (PGC) population, reprogramming of nuclear DNA to reset imprinted gene expression, and differentiation of mature gametes. Little is known of the genes that regulate quantitative and qualitative aspects of early mammalian germ cell development both in vivo, and during differentiation of germ cells from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a transgenic mouse system that enabled isolation of small numbers of Oct4DeltaPE:GFP-positive germ cells in vivo, and following differentiation from mESCs in vitro, to uncover quantitate and qualitative phenotypes associated with the disruption of a single translational regulator, Dazl. We demonstrate that disruption of Dazl results in a post-migratory, pre-meiotic reduction in PGC number accompanied by aberrant expression of pluripotency genes and failure to erase and re-establish genomic imprints in isolated male and female PGCs, as well as subsequent defect in progression through meiosis. Moreover, the phenotypes observed in vivo were mirrored by those in vitro, with inability of isolated mutant PGCs to establish pluripotent EG (embryonic germ) cell lines and few residual Oct-4-expressing cells remaining after somatic differentiation of mESCs carrying a Dazl null mutation. Finally, we observed that even within undifferentiated mESCs, a nascent germ cell subpopulation exists that was effectively eliminated with ablation of Dazl. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This report establishes the translational regulator Dazl as a component of pluripotency, genetic, and epigenetic programs at multiple time points of germ cell development in vivo and in vitro, and validates use of the ESC system to model and explore germ cell biology."
19439664,1,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2009,Plk1 self-organization and priming phosphorylation of HsCYK-4 at the spindle midzone regulate the onset of division in human cells.,"Animal cells initiate cytokinesis in parallel with anaphase onset, when an actomyosin ring assembles and constricts through localized activation of the small GTPase RhoA, giving rise to a cleavage furrow. Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear. Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control, we show that the self-organized delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When Plk1 was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark, both cortical RhoA recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur, thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific Plk1 inhibition. Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found that Plk1 binds and directly phosphorylates the HsCYK-4 subunit of centralspindlin (also known as MgcRacGAP) at the midzone. At serine 157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Ect2. Cells expressing only a nonphosphorylatable form of HsCYK-4 failed to localize Ect2 at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation, implying that HsCYK-4 is Plk1's rate-limiting target upstream of RhoA. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of Plk1 to HsCYK-4 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all other Plk1 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells and illustrate the power of chemical genetics to probe such regulation both in time and space."
19440044,0,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,CD1c bypasses lysosomes to present a lipopeptide antigen with 12 amino acids.,"The recent discovery of dideoxymycobactin (DDM) as a ligand for CD1a demonstrates how a nonribosomal lipopeptide antigen is presented to T cells. DDM contains an unusual acylation motif and a peptide sequence present only in mycobacteria, but its discovery raises the possibility that ribosomally produced viral or mammalian proteins that commonly undergo lipidation might also function as antigens. To test this, we measured T cell responses to synthetic acylpeptides that mimic lipoproteins produced by cells and viruses. CD1c presented an N-acyl glycine dodecamer peptide (lipo-12) to human T cells, and the response was specific for the acyl linkage as well as the peptide length and sequence. Thus, CD1c represents the second member of the CD1 family to present lipopeptides. lipo-12 was efficiently recognized when presented by intact cells, and unlike DDM, it was inactivated by proteases and augmented by protease inhibitors. Although lysosomes often promote antigen presentation by CD1, rerouting CD1c to lysosomes by mutating CD1 tail sequences caused reduction in lipo-12 presentation. Thus, although certain antigens require antigen processing in lysosomes, others are destroyed there, providing a hypothesis for the evolutionary conservation of large CD1 families containing isoforms that survey early endosomal pathways."
19440047,0,Virology,110674,2009,An interdomain RNA binding site on the hepadnaviral polymerase that is essential for reverse transcription.,"The T3 motif on the duck hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase (P) is proposed to be a binding site essential for viral replication, but its ligand and roles in DNA synthesis are unknown. Here, we found that T3 is needed for P to bind the viral RNA, the first step in DNA synthesis. A second motif, RT-1, was predicted to assist T3. T3 and RT-1 appear to form a composite RNA binding site because mutating T3 and RT-1 had similar effects on RNA binding, exposure of antibody epitopes on P, and DNA synthesis. The T3 and RT-1 motifs bound RNA non-specifically, yet they were essential for specific interactions between P and the viral RNA. This implies that specificity for the viral RNA is provided by a post-binding step. The T3:RT-1 motifs are conserved with the human hepatitis B virus and may be an attractive target for novel antiviral drug development."

However, to obtain accurate and physiologically meaningful data from these microarrays, one needs to consider several factors when designing the studies. This article focuses on effective experimental design while the companion article focuses on methodology and data analysis. Biological cycles have a major influence on gene expression, and at least 10% of the expressed genes are likely to show a 24-h expression pattern. Consequently, the time of day when RNA samples are collected can influence detection of significant changes in gene expression levels. Similarly, when photoperiodic species such as the rhesus macaque are housed outdoors, some of their genes show differential expression according to the time of year. In addition, the sex-steroid environment of humans and many nonhuman primates changes markedly across the menstrual cycle, and so phase of the cycle needs to be considered when studying gene expression in adult females."
19440335,0,Methods,9426302,2009,Generation of transgenic monkeys with human inherited genetic disease.,"Modeling human diseases using nonhuman primates including chimpanzee, rhesus, cynomolgus, marmoset and squirrel monkeys has been reported in the past decades. Due to the high similarity between nonhuman primates and humans, including genome constitution, cognitive behavioral functions, anatomical structure, metabolic, reproductive, and brain functions; nonhuman primates have played an important role in understanding physiological functions of the human body, clarifying the underlying mechanism of human diseases, and the development of novel treatments for human diseases. However, nonhuman primate research has been restricted to cognitive, behavioral, biochemical and pharmacological approaches of human diseases due to the limitation of gene transfer technology in nonhuman primates. The recent advancement in transgenic technology that has led to the generation of the first transgenic monkey in 2001 and a transgenic monkey model of Huntington's disease (HD) in 2008 has changed that focus. The creation of transgenic HD monkeys that replicate key pathological features of human HD patients further suggests the crucial role of nonhuman primates in the future development of biomedicine. These successes have opened the door to genetic manipulation in nonhuman primates and a new era in modeling human inherited genetic disorders. We focused on the procedures in creating transgenic Huntington's disease monkeys, but our work can be applied to transgenesis in other nonhuman primate species."
19440340,0,Methods,9426302,2009,Bioinformatic approaches to identifying orthologs and assessing evolutionary relationships.,"Non-human primate genetic research defines itself through comparisons to humans; few other species require the implicit comparative genomics approaches. Because of this, errors in the identification of non-human primate orthologs can have profound effects. Gene prediction algorithms can and have produced false transcripts that have become incorporated into commonly used databases and genomics portals. These false transcripts can arise from deficiencies in the algorithms themselves as well as through gaps and other problems in the genome assembly. Putative genes generated can not only miss microexons, but improperly incorporate non-coding sequence resulting in pseudogenes or other transcripts without biological relevance. False transcripts then become identified as orthologs to established human genes and are too often taken as gospel by unwary researchers. Here, the processes through which these errors propagate are isolated and methods are described for identifying false orthologs in databases with several representative errors illustrated. Through these steps any researcher seeking to make use of non-human primate genetic information will have the tools at their disposal to ascertain where errors exist and to remedy them once encountered."

While much remains to be explained about the regulation and role of these kinases, the veil has been at least partly raised on the Msts, revealing unexpected modes of activation and function. Work in model organisms suggests a central growth-suppressive role for Mst orthologs, with intriguing possible links to other established tumor suppressors. This minireview underlines our current understanding of how Mst1 and Mst2 are regulated, and how activation of these proteins influences cell survival and proliferation."

19440549,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Effect of a single-amino acid substitution of the 43 kDa chlorophyll protein on the oxygen-evolving reaction of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803: analysis of the Glu354Gln mutation.,"We constructed a mutant (CP43-Glu354Gln) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in which the glutamic acid at position 354 of the 43 kDa chlorophyll protein (CP43) was replaced with glutamine. To determine the effect of this mutation on the reaction processes of the Mn cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex, we mainly analyzed the spectroscopic properties, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, of photosystem II core complexes. Mutant cells exhibited a lower oxygen-evolving activity than wild-type cells, and an altered pattern of flash-dependent delayed luminescence. This phenotype differed somewhat from an earlier report of the same mutant [Strickler, M. A., et al. (2008) Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 363, 1179-1187]. FTIR difference spectroscopy revealed that CP43-Glu354 functions as a ligand to the Mn cluster, most likely with bridging bidentate coordination to two Mn ions in the S(1) state and chelating bidentate coordination to a single Mn ion in the S(2) state. A single water molecule was bound to the same Mn atom to which CP43-Glu354 was ligated, and this Mn atom was oxidized in the S(1)-to-S(2) transition. This is the first report on a binding site of a water molecule relevant to a specific amino acid ligand. We found that the Mn ion or ligand that is oxidized in the S(2)-to-S(3) transition was not directly coupled to CP43-Glu354. While the definitive assignment of ligation to the Mn atoms is still under debate, our identification of a novel water binding site will lead to new insights into the oxygen evolution mechanism."
19440550,0,Nat. Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,The Patched dependence receptor triggers apoptosis through a DRAL-caspase-9 complex.,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and its main receptor, Patched (Ptc), are implicated in both neural development and tumorigenesis. Besides its classic morphogenic activity, Shh is also a survival factor. Along this line, Ptc has been shown to function as a dependence receptor; it induces apoptosis in the absence of Shh, whereas its pro-apoptotic activity is blocked in the presence of Shh. Here we show that, in the absence of its ligand, Ptc interacts with the adaptor protein DRAL (downregulated in rhabdomyosarcoma LIM-domain protein; also known as FHL2). DRAL is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of Ptc both in immortalized cells and during neural tube development in chick embryos. We demonstrate that, in the absence of Shh, Ptc recruits a protein complex that includes DRAL, one of the caspase recruitment (CARD)-domain containing proteins TUCAN (family member, 8) or NALP1 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 1) and apical caspase-9. Ptc triggers caspase-9 activation and enhances cell death through a caspase-9-dependent mechanism. Thus, we propose that in the absence of its ligand Shh the dependence receptor Ptc serves as the anchor for a caspase-activating complex that includes DRAL, and caspase-9."

The products of the 13 FANC genes (mutated in Fanconi anaemia), which constitute the 'FANC' pathway, and BLM (the RecQ helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome) are thought to collaborate during the S phase of the cell cycle, preventing chromosome instability. Recently, BLM has been implicated in the completion of sister chromatid separation during mitosis, a complex process in which precise regulation and execution is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Here we show for the first time a role for the FANC pathway in chromosome segregation during mitotic cell division. FANCD2, a key component of the pathway, localizes to discrete spots on mitotic chromosomes. FANCD2 chromosomal localization is responsive to replicative stress and specifically targets aphidicolin (APH)-induced chromatid gaps and breaks. Our data indicate that the FANC pathway is involved in rescuing abnormal anaphase and telophase (ana-telophase) cells, limiting aneuploidy and reducing chromosome instability in daughter cells. We further address a cooperative role for the FANC pathway and BLM in preventing micronucleation, through FANC-dependent targeting of BLM to non-centromeric abnormal structures induced by replicative stress. We reveal new crosstalk between FANC and BLM proteins, extending their interaction beyond the S-phase rescue of damaged DNA to the safeguarding of chromosome stability during mitosis."

Here we report the crystal structures of TRAF6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) Ubc13. The RING and zinc fingers of TRAF6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. Interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13 involves direct contacts of the RING and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. Unexpectedly, this region of TRAF6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric C-terminal TRAF domain. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals that TRAF6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that TRAF6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length TRAF6. The mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors."
19441796,0,Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.,101186374,2009,PKC maturation is promoted by nucleotide pocket occupation independently of intrinsic kinase activity.,"The protein kinase C (PKC) Ser/Thr kinases account for approximately 2% of the human kinome and regulate diverse cellular behaviors. PKC catalytic activity requires priming phosphorylations at three conserved sites within the kinase domain. Here we demonstrate that priming of PKC is dependent on the conformation of the nucleotide binding pocket but not on its intrinsic kinase activity. Inactive ATP binding site mutants are unprimed, but they become phosphorylated upon occupancy of the ATP binding pocket with inhibitors of PKC. We have exploited this property to screen for PKC inhibitors in vivo. Further, we generated a distinct class of kinase-inactive mutants that maintain the integrity of the ATP binding pocket; such mutants are constitutively primed and functionally distinct from ATP binding site mutants. These data demonstrate that autophosphorylation is not required for PKC priming and show how ATP pocket occupation can enable a kinase to mature as well as function."

The hippocampus, which is a region of the brain important for long-term memory formation and temporary maintenance, shows circadian rhythmicity in pathways central to the memory-consolidation process. As neuronal plasticity is the translation of numerous inputs, illuminating the direct molecular links between circadian rhythms and memory consolidation remains a daunting task. However, the elucidation of how clock genes contribute to synaptic plasticity could provide such a link. Furthermore, the idea that memory training could actually function as a zeitgeber for hippocampal neurons is worth consideration, based on our knowledge of the entrainment of the circadian clock system. The integration of many inputs in the hippocampus affects memory consolidation at both the cellular and the systems level, leaving the molecular connections between circadian rhythmicity and memory relatively obscure but ripe for investigation."
19441831,0,J. Bacteriol.,2985120R,2009,Nucleotide excision repair is a predominant mechanism for processing nitrofurazone-induced DNA damage in Escherichia coli.,"Nitrofurazone is reduced by cellular nitroreductases to form N(2)-deoxyguanine (N(2)-dG) adducts that are associated with mutagenesis and lethality. Much attention recently has been given to the role that the highly conserved polymerase IV (Pol IV) family of polymerases plays in tolerating adducts induced by nitrofurazone and other N(2)-dG-generating agents, yet little is known about how nitrofurazone-induced DNA damage is processed by the cell. In this study, we characterized the genetic repair pathways that contribute to survival and mutagenesis in Escherichia coli cultures grown in the presence of nitrofurazone. We find that nucleotide excision repair is a primary mechanism for processing damage induced by nitrofurazone. The contribution of translesion synthesis to survival was minor compared to that of nucleotide excision repair and depended upon Pol IV. In addition, survival also depended on both the RecF and RecBCD pathways. We also found that nitrofurazone acts as a direct inhibitor of DNA replication at higher concentrations. We show that the direct inhibition of replication by nitrofurazone occurs independently of DNA damage and is reversible once the nitrofurazone is removed. Previous studies that reported nucleotide excision repair mutants that were fully resistant to nitrofurazone used high concentrations of the drug (200 microM) and short exposure times. We demonstrate here that these conditions inhibit replication but are insufficient in duration to induce significant levels of DNA damage."

We studied the synthesis and secretion of transferrin in rat parotid acinar cells in order to elucidate its secretory pathways. Two sources were identified for transferrin in parotid acinar cells: synthesis by the cells (endogenous), and absorption from blood plasma (exogenous). Transferrin from both sources is secreted from the apical side of parotid acinar cells. Endogenous transferrin is transported to secretory granules. It is secreted from mature secretory granules upon stimulation with a beta-adrenergic reagent and from smaller vesicles in the absence of stimulation. Exogenous transferrin is internalized from the basolateral side of parotid acinar cells, transported to the apical side by transcytosis, and secreted from the apical side. Secretory processes for exogenous transferrin include transport systems involving microfilaments and microtubules."

The Foxp3(+) iTreg cell repertoire is drawn from naive conventional CD4(+) T cells, whereas natural Treg (nTreg) cells are selected by high-avidity interactions in the thymus. The full extent of differences and similarities between iTreg and nTreg cells is yet to be defined. We speculate that iTreg cell development is driven by the need to maintain a noninflammatory environment in the gut, to suppress immune responses to environmental and food allergens, and to decrease chronic inflammation, whereas nTreg cells prevent autoimmunity and raise the activation threshold for all immune responses."

Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interactions of eEF1A1, p54(nrb), hnRNP-L, GAPDH and ASF/SF2 with the right terminal stem-loop domain of HDV genomic RNA in vitro, and with both polarities of HDV RNA within HeLa cells. Our discovery that HDV RNA associates with RNA-processing pathways and translation machinery during its replication provides new insights into HDV biology and its pathogenicity."

A plasmid-based HBV replication assay was used to evaluate whether HBx subcellular localization influences its ability to promote virus replication, as measured by real time PCR quantitation of viral capsid-associated DNA. HBx targeted to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal (NLS-HBx) was able to restore HBx-deficient HBV replication, while HBx containing a nuclear export signal (NES-HBx) was not. Both NLS-HBx and NES-HBx were expressed at similar levels (by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting), and proper localization of the signal sequence-tagged proteins was confirmed by deconvolution microscopy using HBx, NLS-HBx, and NES-HBx proteins fused to GFP. Importantly, these findings were confirmed in vivo by hydrodynamic injection into mice. Our results demonstrate that in these HBV replication assays, at least one function of HBx requires its localization to the nucleus."
19443615,0,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Structure of the human Rev1-DNA-dNTP ternary complex.,"Y-family DNA polymerases have proven to be remarkably diverse in their functions and in strategies for replicating through DNA lesions. The structure of yeast Rev1 ternary complex has revealed the most radical replication strategy, where the polymerase itself dictates the identity of the incoming nucleotide, as well as the identity of the templating base. We show here that many of the key elements of this highly unusual strategy are conserved between yeast and human Rev1, including the eviction of template G from the DNA helix and the pairing of incoming deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate with a surrogate arginine residue. We also show that the catalytic core of human Rev1 is uniquely augmented by two large inserts, I1 and I2, wherein I1 extends &gt;20 A away from the active site and may serve as a platform for protein-protein interactions specific for Rev1's role in translesion DNA synthesis in human cells, and I2 acts as a &quot;flap&quot; on the hydrophobic pocket accommodating template G. We suggest that these novel structural features are important for providing human Rev1 greater latitude in promoting efficient and error-free translesion DNA synthesis through the diverse array of bulky and potentially carcinogenic N(2)-deoxyguanosine DNA adducts in human cells."

Commun.,372516,2009,Intriguing similarities between two novel odorant-binding proteins of locusts.,"Two novel odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) of locust, LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3 are very different from each other and from the previously reported LmigOBP1 in their amino acid sequences. Moreover, OBP3 contains three additional cysteines, a fact not previously recorded in standard length OBPs. However, these two proteins exhibit remarkably similar binding affinities to a set of organic compounds. Such behaviour is supported by three-dimensional models, showing very similar folding for LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3, but clearly different for LmigOBP1. Also several amino acid residues lining the binding pockets of the three proteins appear conserved in LmigOBP2 and LmigOBP3, but not in LmigOBP1. Western blot experiments revealed the presence of LmigOBP2 in antennae, mouth parts and cerci, but could not detected LmigOBP3 in any of these tissues. In immunocytochemistry, antibodies against LmigOBP2 strongly stained the outer lymph of sensilla chaetica of the antennae, in contrast with LmigOBP1, previously reported in sensilla basiconica."

Commun.,372516,2009,Thermodynamic analysis of hydration in human serum heme-albumin.,"Ferric human serum heme-albumin (heme-HSA) shows a peculiar nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) behavior that allows to investigate structural and functional properties. Here, we report a thermodynamic analysis of NMRD profiles of heme-HSA between 20 and 60 degrees C to characterize its hydration. NMRD profiles, all showing two Lorentzian dispersions at 0.3 and 60 MHz, were analyzed in terms of modulation of the zero field splitting tensor for the S=5/2 manifold. Values of correlation times for tensor fluctuation (tau(v)) and chemical exchange of water molecules (tau(M)) show the expected temperature dependence, with activation enthalpies of -1.94 and -2.46+/-0.2 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The cluster of water molecules located in the close proximity of the heme is progressively reduced in size by increasing the temperature, with DeltaH=68+/-28 kJ mol(-1) and DeltaS=200+/-80 J mol(-1) K(-1). These results highlight the role of the water solvent in heme-HSA structure-function relationships."

Biophys.,372430,2009,Stimulation of Akt poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in P388D1 cells by 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol.,"Akt plays a role in protecting macrophages from apoptosis induced by some oxysterols. Previously we observed enhanced degradation of Akt in P388D1 moncocyte/macrophages following treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) or 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In the present report we examine the role of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway in this process. We show that treatment with 25-OH or 7-KC results in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated Akt, an effect that is enhanced by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Modification of Akt by the addition of a Gly-Ala repeat (GAr), a domain known to block ubiquitin-dependent targeting of proteins to the proteasome, resulted in a chimeric protein that is resistant to turn-over induced by 25-OH or 7-KC and provides protection from apoptosis induced by these oxysterols. These results uncover a new aspect of oxysterol regulation of Akt in macrophages; oxysterol-stimulated poly-ubiquitination of Akt and degradation by the proteasomal pathway."
19443719,0,Immunity,9432918,2009,Antigen ligation triggers a conformational change within the constant domain of the alphabeta T cell receptor.,"Ligation of the alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR) by a specific peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule initiates T cell signaling via the CD3 complex. However, the initial events that link antigen recognition to T cell signal transduction remain unclear. Here we show, via fluorescence-based experiments and structural analyses, that MHC-restricted antigen recognition by the alphabeta TCR results in a specific conformational change confined to the A-B loop within the alpha chain of the constant domain (Calpha). The apparent affinity constant of this A-B loop movement mirrored that of alphabeta TCR-pMHC ligation and was observed in two alphabeta TCRs with distinct pMHC specificities. The Ag-induced A-B loop conformational change could be inhibited by fixing the juxtapositioning of the constant domains and was shown to be reversible upon pMHC disassociation. Notably, the loop movement within the Calpha domain, although specific for an agonist pMHC ligand, was not observed with a pMHC antagonist. Moreover, mutagenesis of residues within the A-B loop impaired T cell signaling in an in vitro system of antigen-specific TCR stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the earliest molecular events that underlie Ag-induced T cell triggering."
19443724,0,Virology,110674,2009,Adeno-associated virus infection of murine fibroblasts with help provided by mouse adenovirus.,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV-2) replicates to high titers when host cells are coinfected with a helper virus. Here we analyzed the coinfection of AAV-2 and mouse adenovirus (MAV-1) in murine fibroblasts. We observed that AAV-2/MAV-1 coinfected NIH 3T3 cells produced approximately 10-40-fold less AAV-2 DNAse resistant particles than Hela cells. Levels of AAV-2 DNA replication were approximately 30-fold less in 3T3 cells as compared to Hela cells coinfected with human adenovirus (Ad-5). A study of these lower levels of infection in 3T3 cells compared to Hela cells revealed that receptor binding and internalization of AAV-2 in 3T3 and Hela cells was comparable. However, AAV-2 did not enter into the nucleus of mouse cells as efficiently as it does in human cells. Furthermore, viral DNA replication levels of AAV-2 DNA were found to be lower in mouse cells than human cells, indicating limitations in the murine nucleus for viral replication."
19443729,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Susceptibility of antiviral drugs against 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus.,"The recent outbreak of the novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus has raised a global concern of the future risk of a pandemic. To understand at the molecular level how this new H1N1 virus can be inhibited by the current anti-influenza drugs and which of these drugs it is likely to already be resistant to, homology modeling and MD simulations have been applied on the H1N1 neuraminidase complexed with oseltamivir, and the M2-channel with adamantanes bound. The H1N1 virus was predicted to be susceptible to oseltamivir, with all important interactions with the binding residues being well conserved. In contrast, adamantanes are not predicted to be able to inhibit the M2 function and have completely lost their binding with the M2 residues. This is mainly due to the fact that the M2 transmembrane of the new H1N1 strain contains the S31N mutation which is known to confer resistance to adamantanes."
19443735,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,The impact of nucleosome positioning on the organization of replication origins in eukaryotes.,"The distribution of DNA replication origins (ORIs) on eukaryotic chromosomes is nonrandom, but the reasons behind this are not well understood. Previous studies have suggested a prominent role of transcriptional activity in determining the ORI organization. Here, we identify nucleosome occupancy as a likely candidate to set up ORI distribution. Combining genome-wide data on nucleosome positioning and ORI organization in yeast and humans, we demonstrate that open chromatin domains, characterized by nucleosome depletion, are preferentially permissive for replication. However, contrary to priori claims, the impact of transcriptional activity is considerably weaker than previously proposed and could partly be explained by our nucleosome exclusion model. We propose that the ORI organization imposed by nucleosome positioning is phylogenetically widespread in eukaryotes."
19443739,0,BMC Mol. Biol.,100966983,2009,Breeding response of transcript profiling in developing seeds of Brassica napus.,"BACKGROUND: The upgrading of rapeseed cultivars has resulted in a substantial improvement in yield and quality in China over the past 30 years. With the selective pressure against fatty acid composition and oil content, high erucic acid- and low oil-content cultivars have been replaced by low erucic acid- and high oil-content cultivars. The high erucic acid cultivar Zhongyou 821 and its descendent, low erucic acid cultivar Zhongshuang 9, are representatives of two generations of the most outstanding Chinese rapeseed cultivars (B. napus) developed the past 2 decades. This paper compares the transcriptional profiles of Zhongshuang 9 and Zhongyou 821 for 32 genes that are principally involved in lipid biosynthesis during seed development in order to elucidate how the transcriptional profiles of these genes responded to quality improvement over the past 20 years. RESULTS: Comparison of the cultivar Zhongyou 821 with its descendent, Zhongshuang 9, shows that the transcriptional levels of seven of the 32 genes were upregulated by 30% to 109%, including FAD3, ACCase, FAE1, GKTP, Caleosin, GAPDH, and PEPC. Of the 32 genes, 10 (KAS3, beta-CT, BcRK6, P450, FatA, Oleosin, FAD6, FatB, alpha-CT and SUC1) were downregulated by at least 20% and most by 50%. The Napin gene alone accounted for over 75% of total transcription from all 32 genes assessed in both cultivars. Most of the genes showed significant correlation with fatty acid accumulation, but the correlation in ZS9 was significantly different from that in ZY821. Higher KCR2 activity is associated with higher C16:0, C18:0, and C18:2 in both cultivars, lower C22:1 and total fatty acid content in ZY821, and lower 18:1 in ZS9. CONCLUSION: This paper illustrates the response of the transcription levels of 32 genes to breeding in developing rapeseed seeds. Both cultivars showed similar transcription profiles, with the Napin gene predominantly transcribed. Selective pressure for zero erucic acid, low glucosinolate, high oleic acid and high oil content, as well as high yield, resulted in higher FAD3, ACCase, FAE1, GKTP, Caleosin, GAPDH, and PEPC expression levels and lower KAS3, beta-CT, BcRK6, P450, FatA, Oleosin, FAD6, FatB, alpha-CT and SUC1 expression levels. It also resulted in altered relationships between these genes during storage accumulation in seed development."
19443777,0,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Orymold: ontology based gene expression data integration and analysis tool applied to rice.,"BACKGROUND: Integration and exploration of data obtained from genome wide monitoring technologies has become a major challenge for many bioinformaticists and biologists due to its heterogeneity and high dimensionality. A widely accepted approach to solve these issues has been the creation and use of controlled vocabularies (ontologies). Ontologies allow for the formalization of domain knowledge, which in turn enables generalization in the creation of querying interfaces as well as in the integration of heterogeneous data, providing both human and machine readable interfaces. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a software tool that allows investigators to create their own semantic model of an organism and to use it to dynamically integrate expression data obtained from DNA microarrays and other probe based technologies. The software provides tools to use the semantic model to postulate and validate of hypotheses on the spatial and temporal expression and function of genes. In order to illustrate the software's use and features, we used it to build a semantic model of rice (Oryza sativa) and integrated experimental data into it. CONCLUSION: In this paper we describe the development and features of a flexible software application for dynamic gene expression data annotation, integration, and exploration called Orymold.

19443779,0,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,Differential splicing using whole-transcript microarrays.,"BACKGROUND: The latest generation of Affymetrix microarrays are designed to interrogate expression over the entire length of every locus, thus giving the opportunity to study alternative splicing genome-wide. The Exon 1.0 ST (sense target) platform, with versions for Human, Mouse and Rat, is designed primarily to probe every known or predicted exon. The smaller Gene 1.0 ST array is designed as an expression microarray but still interrogates expression with probes along the full length of each well-characterized transcript. We explore the possibility of using the Gene 1.0 ST platform to identify differential splicing events. RESULTS: We propose a strategy to score differential splicing by using the auxiliary information from fitting the statistical model, RMA (robust multichip analysis). RMA partitions the probe-level data into probe effects and expression levels, operating robustly so that if a small number of probes behave differently than the rest, they are downweighted in the fitting step. We argue that adjacent poorly fitting probes for a given sample can be evidence of differential splicing and have designed a statistic to search for this behaviour. Using a public tissue panel dataset, we show many examples of tissue-specific alternative splicing. Furthermore, we show that evidence for putative alternative splicing has a strong correspondence between the Gene 1.0 ST and Exon 1.0 ST platforms. CONCLUSION: We propose a new approach, FIRMAGene, to search for differentially spliced genes using the Gene 1.0 ST platform. Such an analysis complements the search for differential expression. We validate the method by illustrating several known examples and we note some of the challenges in interpreting the probe-level data.Software implementing our methods is freely available as an R package."

19444309,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Polycomb mediated epigenetic silencing and replication timing at the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence.,"BACKGROUND: The INK4/ARF locus encodes three tumor suppressor genes (p15(Ink4b), Arf and p16(Ink4a)) and is frequently inactivated in a large number of human cancers. Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus."
19445507,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Unstable prefrontal response to emotional conflict and activation of lower limbic structures and brainstem in remitted panic disorder.,"BACKGROUND: The neural mechanisms of panic disorder (PD) are only incompletely understood. Higher sensitivity of patients to unspecific fear cues and similarities to conditioned fear suggest involvement of lower limbic and brainstem structures. We investigated if emotion perception is altered in remitted PD as a trait feature. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study neural and behavioural responses of 18 remitted PD patients and 18 healthy subjects to the emotional conflict paradigm that is based on the presentation of emotionally congruent and incongruent face/word pairs. We observed that patients showed stronger behavioural interference and lower adaptation to interference conflict. Overall performance in patients was slower but not less accurate. In the context of preceding congruence, stronger dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during conflict detection was found in patients. In the context of preceding incongruence, controls expanded dACC activity and succeeded in reducing behavioural interference. In contrast, patients demonstrated a dropout of dACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) recruitment but activation of the lower limbic areas (including right amygdala) and brainstem. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence that stimulus order in the presentation of emotional stimuli has a markedly larger influence on the brain's response in remitted PD than in controls, leading to abnormal responses of the dACC/dmPFC and lower limbic structures (including the amygdala) and brainstem. Processing of non-panic related emotional stimuli is disturbed in PD patients despite clinical remission."
19445514,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Musical aptitude is associated with AVPR1A-haplotypes.,"Artistic creativity forms the basis of music culture and music industry. Composing, improvising and arranging music are complex creative functions of the human brain, which biological value remains unknown. We hypothesized that practicing music is social communication that needs musical aptitude and even creativity in music. In order to understand the neurobiological basis of music in human evolution and communication we analyzed polymorphisms of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A), serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), catecol-O-methyltranferase (COMT), dopamin receptor D2 (DRD2) and tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), genes associated with social bonding and cognitive functions in 19 Finnish families (n = 343 members) with professional musicians and/or active amateurs. All family members were tested for musical aptitude using the auditory structuring ability test (Karma Music test; KMT) and Carl Seashores tests for pitch (SP) and for time (ST). Data on creativity in music (composing, improvising and/or arranging music) was surveyed using a web-based questionnaire. Here we show for the first time that creative functions in music have a strong genetic component (h(2) = .84; composing h(2) = .40; arranging h(2) = .46; improvising h(2) = .62) in Finnish multigenerational families. We also show that high music test scores are significantly associated with creative functions in music (p&lt;.0001). We discovered an overall haplotype association with AVPR1A gene (markers RS1 and RS3) and KMT (p = 0.0008; corrected p = 0.00002), SP (p = 0.0261; corrected p = 0.0072) and combined music test scores (COMB) (p = 0.0056; corrected p = 0.0006). AVPR1A haplotype AVR+RS1 further suggested a positive association with ST (p = 0.0038; corrected p = 0.00184) and COMB (p = 0.0083; corrected p = 0.0040) using haplotype-based association test HBAT. The results suggest that the neurobiology of music perception and production is likely to be related to the pathways affecting intrinsic attachment behavior."
19445518,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Absence of AKT1 mutations in glioblastoma.,"BACKGROUND: Oncogenic activation of the PI3K signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A central node in PI3K downstream signalling is controlled by the serine-threonine kinase AKT1. A somatic mutation affecting residue E17 of the AKT1 gene has recently been identified in breast and colon cancer. The E17K change results in constitutive AKT1 activation, induces leukaemia in mice, and accordingly, may be therapeutically exploited to target the PI3K pathway. Assessing whether AKT1 is activated by somatic mutations in GBM is relevant to establish its role in this aggressive disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic mutational analysis of the complete coding sequence of the AKT1 gene in a panel of 109 tumor GBM samples and nine high grade astrocytoma cell lines. However, no somatic mutations were detected in the coding region of AKT1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that in GBM oncogenic deregulation of the PI3K pathway does not involve somatic mutations in the coding region of AKT1."
19445587,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Paleogenomics in a temperate environment: shotgun sequencing from an extinct Mediterranean caprine.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous endemic mammals, including dwarf elephants, goats, hippos and deers, evolved in isolation in the Mediterranean islands during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Most of them subsequently became extinct during the Holocene. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies could provide a unique tool for retrieving genomic data from these extinct species, making it possible to study their evolutionary history and the genetic bases underlying their particular, sometimes unique, adaptations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS FINDINGS: A DNA extraction of a approximately 6,000 year-old bone sample from an extinct caprine (Myotragus balearicus) from the Balearic Islands in the Western Mediterranean, has been subjected to shotgun sequencing with the GS FLX 454 platform. Only 0.27% of the resulting sequences, identified from alignments with the cow genome and comprising 15,832 nucleotides, with an average length of 60 nucleotides, proved to be endogenous. CONCLUSIONS: A phylogenetic tree generated with Myotragus sequences and those from other artiodactyls displays an identical topology to that generated from mitochondrial DNA data. Despite being in an unfavourable thermal environment, which explains the low yield of endogenous sequences, our study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain genomic data from extinct species from temperate regions."
19445598,1,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2009,Adaptive variation regulates the expression of the human SGK1 gene in response to stress.,"The Serum and Glucocorticoid-regulated Kinase1 (SGK1) gene is a target of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and is central to the stress response in many human tissues. Because environmental stress varies across habitats, we hypothesized that natural selection shaped the geographic distribution of genetic variants regulating the level of SGK1 expression following GR activation. By combining population genetics and molecular biology methods, we identified a variant (rs9493857) with marked allele frequency differences between populations of African and European ancestry and with a strong correlation between allele frequency and latitude in worldwide population samples. This SNP is located in a GR-binding region upstream of SGK1 that was identified using a GR ChIP-chip. SNP rs9493857 also lies within a predicted binding site for Oct1, a transcription factor known to cooperate with the GR in the transactivation of target genes. Using ChIP assays, we show that both GR and Oct1 bind to this region and that the ancestral allele at rs9493857 binds the GR-Oct1 complex more efficiently than the derived allele. Finally, using a reporter gene assay, we demonstrate that the ancestral allele is associated with increased glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression when compared to the derived allele. Our results suggest a novel paradigm in which hormonal responsiveness is modulated by sequence variation in the regulatory regions of nuclear receptor target genes. Identifying such functional variants may shed light on the mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation in response to environmental stressors and to hormonal therapy, as well as in the susceptibility to hormone-dependent diseases."
19446321,1,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,How to get the most out of your curation effort.,"Large-scale annotation efforts typically involve several experts who may disagree with each other. We propose an approach for modeling disagreements among experts that allows providing each annotation with a confidence value (i.e., the posterior probability that it is correct). Our approach allows computing certainty-level for individual annotations, given annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. We developed two probabilistic models for performing this analysis, compared these models using computer simulation, and tested each model's actual performance, based on a large data set generated by human annotators specifically for this study. We show that even in the worst-case scenario, when all annotators disagree, our approach allows us to significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation. Along with this publication we make publicly available a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated according to several cardinal dimensions that we have introduced in earlier work. The 10,000 sentences were all 3-fold annotated by a group of eight experts, while a 1,000-sentence subset was further 5-fold annotated by five new experts. While the presented data represent a specialized curation task, our modeling approach is general; most data annotation studies could benefit from our methodology."
19446322,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Deaminase-independent inhibition of parvoviruses by the APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase.,"The APOBEC3 proteins form a multigene family of cytidine deaminases with inhibitory activity against viruses and retrotransposons. In contrast to APOBEC3G (A3G), APOBEC3A (A3A) has no effect on lentiviruses but dramatically inhibits replication of the parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV). To study the contribution of deaminase activity to the antiviral activity of A3A, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of A3A. By mutation of non-conserved residues, we found that regions outside of the catalytic active site contribute to both deaminase and antiviral activities. Using A3A point mutants and A3A/A3G chimeras, we show that deaminase activity is not required for inhibition of recombinant AAV production. We also found that deaminase-deficient A3A mutants block replication of both wild-type AAV and the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM). In addition, we identify specific residues of A3A that confer activity against AAV when substituted into A3G. In summary, our results demonstrate that deaminase activity is not necessary for the antiviral activity of A3A against parvoviruses."

Functional sGC is generated by the dimerization of an alpha-subunit (sGCalpha1/2) with the beta1-subunit (sGCbeta1), and both depletion of the sGCbeta1 subunit and inhibiting sGC activity impair neurite outgrowth. Similarly, impairing sGC activity diminishes the amount of growth-associated protein (GAP-43) and synapsin I, two proteins that participate in axon elongation and synaptogenesis, suggesting a role for sGC in these processes. Indeed, fewer synapses form when sGC is inhibited, as witnessed by FM1-43 imaging and synapsin I immunostaining, and the majority of synapses that do form remain functionally immature. These findings highlight the importance of sGC in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, and in the functional maturation of cerebellar granule cells in vitro."

Utilizing a series of random peptide and glycopeptide substrates, we have obtained the peptide and glycopeptide specificities of ppGalNAc T10 for comparison with ppGalNAc T1 and T2. For the glycopeptide substrates, ppGalNAc T10 exhibited a single large preference for Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc at the +1 (C-terminal) position relative to the Ser or Thr acceptor site. ppGalNAc T1 and T2 revealed no significant enhancements suggesting Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc was inhibitory at most positions for these isoforms. Against random peptide substrates, ppGalNAc T10 revealed no significant hydrophobic or hydrophilic residue enhancements, in contrast to what has been reported previously for ppGalNAc T1 and T2. Our results reveal that these transferases have unique peptide and glycopeptide preferences demonstrating their substrate diversity and their likely roles ranging from initiating transferases to filling-in transferases."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,A genome-wide short hairpin RNA screening of jurkat T-cells for human proteins contributing to productive HIV-1 replication.,"Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been used to inhibit HIV-1 replication. The durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication by RNA interference has been impeded, however, by a high mutation rate when viral sequences are targeted and by cytotoxicity when cellular genes are knocked down. To identify cellular proteins that contribute to HIV-1 replication that can be chronically silenced without significant cytotoxicity, we employed a shRNA library that targets 54,509 human transcripts. We used this library to select a comprehensive population of Jurkat T-cell clones, each expressing a single discrete shRNA. The Jurkat clones were then infected with HIV-1. Clones that survived viral infection represent moieties silenced for a human mRNA needed for virus replication, but whose chronic knockdown did not cause cytotoxicity. Overall, 252 individual Jurkat mRNAs were identified. Twenty-two of these mRNAs were secondarily verified for their contributions to HIV-1 replication. Five mRNAs, NRF1, STXBP2, NCOA3, PRDM2, and EXOSC5, were studied for their effect on steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. We discuss the similarities and differences between our shRNA findings for HIV-1 using a spreading infection assay in human Jurkat T-cells and results from other investigators who used siRNA-based screenings in HeLa or 293T cells."
19447116,0,Dev. Cell,101120028,2009,Muscle contraction is necessary to maintain joint progenitor cell fate.,"During embryogenesis, organ development is dependent upon maintaining appropriate progenitor cell commitment. Synovial joints develop from a pool of progenitor cells that differentiate into various cell types constituting the mature joint. The involvement of the musculature in joint formation has long been recognized. However, the mechanism by which the musculature regulates joint formation has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate, utilizing various murine models devoid of limb musculature or its contraction, that the contracting musculature is fundamental in maintaining joint progenitors committed to their fate, a requirement for correct joint cavitation and morphogenesis. Furthermore, contraction-dependent activation of beta-catenin, a key modulator of joint formation, provides a molecular mechanism for this regulation. In conclusion, our findings provide the missing link between progenitor cell fate determination and embryonic movement, two processes shown to be essential for correct organogenesis."
19447117,0,Dev. Cell,101120028,2009,The polycomb complex protein mes-2/E(z) promotes the transition from developmental plasticity to differentiation in C. elegans embryos.,"We have used expression profiling and in vivo imaging to characterize Caenorhabditis elegans embryos as they transit from a developmentally plastic state to the onset of differentiation. Normally, this transition is accompanied by activation of developmental regulators and differentiation genes, downregulation of early-expressed genes, and large-scale reorganization of chromatin. We find that loss of plasticity and differentiation onset depends on the Polycomb complex protein mes-2/E(Z). mes-2 mutants display prolonged developmental plasticity in response to heterologous developmental regulators. Early-expressed genes remain active, differentiation genes fail to reach wild-type levels, and chromatin retains a decompacted morphology in mes-2 mutants. By contrast, loss of the developmental regulators pha-4/FoxA or end-1/GATA does not prolong plasticity. This study establishes a model by which to analyze developmental plasticity within an intact embryo. mes-2 orchestrates large-scale changes in chromatin organization and gene expression to promote the timely loss of developmental plasticity. Our findings indicate that loss of plasticity can be uncoupled from cell fate specification."

Cell,101120028,2009,Notch signaling: the core pathway and its posttranslational regulation.,"Notch signaling controls numerous cell-fate specification events in multicellular organisms, and dysregulated Notch signaling causes several diseases with underlying developmental defects. A key step in Notch receptor activation is its intramembrane proteolysis, which releases an intracellular fragment that participates directly in transcriptional regulation of nuclear target genes. Despite the apparent simplicity of this mechanism, a host of posttranslational processes regulate Notch activity during its synthesis and secretion, ligand-dependent activation at the surface, endocytic trafficking, and degradation. This review describes the core developmental logic of Notch signaling and how regulatory mechanisms tailor Notch pathway outputs to specific developmental scenarios."

19447925,0,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,Groucho binds two conserved regions of LEF-1 for HDAC-dependent repression.,"BACKGROUND: Drosophila Groucho and its human Transducin-like-Enhancer of Split orthologs (TLEs) function as transcription co-repressors within the context of Wnt signaling, a pathway with strong links to cancer. The current model for how Groucho/TLE's modify Wnt signaling is by direct competition with beta-catenin for LEF/TCF binding. The molecular events involved in this competitive interaction are not defined and the actions of Groucho/TLEs within the context of Wnt-linked cancer are unknown. METHODS: We used in vitro protein interaction assays with the LEF/TCF family member LEF-1, and in vivo assays with Wnt reporter plasmids to define Groucho/TLE interaction and repressor function. RESULTS: Mapping studies reveal that Groucho/TLE binds two regions in LEF-1. The primary site of recognition is a 20 amino acid region in the Context Dependent Regulatory domain. An auxiliary site is in the High Mobility Group DNA binding domain. Mutation of an eight amino acid sequence within the primary region (RFSHHMIP) results in a loss of Groucho action in a transient reporter assay. Drosophila Groucho, human TLE-1, and a truncated human TLE isoform Amino-enhancer-of-split (AES), work equivalently to repress LEF-1*beta-catenin transcription in transient reporter assays, and these actions are sensitive to the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A. A survey of Groucho/TLE action in a panel of six colon cancer cell lines with elevated beta-catenin shows that Groucho is not able to repress transcription in a subset of these cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that Groucho/TLE repression requires two sites of interaction in LEF-1 and that a central, conserved amino acid sequence within the primary region (F S/T/P/xx y I/L/V) is critical. Our data also reveals that AES opposes LEF-1 transcription activation and that both Groucho and AES repression require histone deacetylase activity suggesting multiple steps in Groucho competition with beta-catenin. The variable ability of Groucho/TLE to oppose Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells suggests there may be defects in one or more of these steps."
19447966,0,BMC Mol. Biol.,100966983,2009,Key role of the 3' untranslated region in the cell cycle regulated expression of the Leishmania infantum histone H2A genes: minor synergistic effect of the 5' untranslated region.,"BACKGROUND: Histone synthesis in Leishmania is tightly coupled to DNA replication by a post-transcriptional mechanism operating at the level of translation. RESULTS: In this work we have analyzed the implication of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) in the cell cycle regulated expression of the histone H2A in Leishmania infantum. For that purpose, L. infantum promastigotes were stably transfected with different plasmid constructs in which the CAT coding region used as a reporter was flanked by the 5' and 3' UTR regions of the different H2A genes. We report that in spite of their sequence differences, histone H2A 5' and 3' UTRs conferred a cell cycle dependent pattern of expression on the CAT reporter since de novo synthesis of CAT increased when parasites enter the S phase. Using one established L. infantum cell line we showed that CAT expression is controlled by the same regulatory events that control the endogenous histone gene expression. Thus, although we did not detect changes in the level of CAT mRNAs during cell cycle progression, a drastic change in the polysome profiles of CAT mRNAs was observed during the progression from G1 to S phase. In the S phase CAT mRNAs were on polyribosomal fractions, but in the G1 phase the association of CAT transcripts with ribosomes was impaired. Furthermore, it was determined that the addition of just the H2A 3' UTR to the CAT reporter gene is sufficient to achieve a similar pattern of post-transcriptional regulation indicating that this region contains the major regulatory sequences involved in the cell cycle dependent expression of the H2A genes. On the other hand, although CAT transcripts bearing the H2A 5' alone were translated both in the G1 and S phase, higher percentages of transcripts were detected on polyribosomes in the S phase correlating with an increase in the de novo synthesis of CAT. Thus, it can be concluded that this region also contributes, although to a minor extent than the 3' UTR, in the enhancement of translation in the S phase relative to the G1 phase. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that both, the 5' and the 3' UTRs contain sequence elements that contribute to the cell cycle expression of L. infantum H2A. The 3' UTR region is essential for cell cycle dependent translation of the L. infantum H2A transcripts whereas the 5' UTR has a minor contribution in their S phase dependent translation."

Chem.,9716531,2009,Discovery of tetrasubstituted imidazolines as potent and selective neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonists: reduced human ether-a-go-go related gene potassium channel binding affinity and potent antiobesity effect.,"A series of novel imidazoline derivatives was synthesized and evaluated as neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y5 receptor antagonists. Optimization of previously reported imidazoline leads, 1a and 1b, was attempted by introduction of substituents at the 5-position on the imidazoline ring and modification of the bis(4-fluorphenyl) moiety. A number of potent derivatives without human ether-a-go-go related gene potassium channel (hERG) activity were identified. Selected compounds, including 2a, were shown to have excellent brain and CSF permeability. Compound 2a displayed a suitable pharmacokinetic profile for chronic in vivo studies and potently inhibited D-Trp(34)NPY-induced acute food intake in rats. Oral administration of 2a resulted in a potent reduction of body weight in a diet-induced obese mouse model."
19448038,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Location of inhibitors bound to group IVA phospholipase A2 determined by molecular dynamics and deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.,"An analysis of group IVA (GIVA) phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor binding was conducted using a combination of deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) and molecular dynamics (MD). Models of the GIVA PLA(2) inhibitors pyrrophenone and the 2-oxoamide AX007 docked into the protein were designed on the basis of deuterium exchange results, and extensive molecular dynamics simulations were run to determine protein-inhibitor contacts. The models show that both inhibitors interact with key residues that also exhibit changes in deuterium exchange upon inhibitor binding. Pyrrophenone is bound to the protein through numerous hydrophobic residues located distal from the active site, while the oxoamide is bound mainly through contacts near the active site. We also show differences in protein dynamics around the active site between the two inhibitor-bound complexes. This combination of computational and experimental methods is useful in defining more accurate inhibitor binding sites and can be used in the generation of better inhibitors against GIVA PLA(2)."
19448041,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,A thermodynamic study of ligand binding to the first three domains of the human insulin receptor: relationship between the receptor alpha-chain C-terminal peptide and the site 1 insulin mimetic peptides.,"The C-terminal segment of the insulin receptor (IR) alpha-chain plays a critical role in insulin binding. This 16-residue peptide together with the central beta-sheet of the receptor L1 domain forms one of the insulin binding surfaces of the IR monomer. Here we use isothermal titration calorimetry to assay directly the binding of the IR alphaCT peptide to an IR construct (IR485) consisting of the three N-terminal domains of the receptor monomer. Our measurements show further that the binding of the IR alphaCT peptide to IR485 competes with the binding of a prototypical &quot;Site 1&quot; insulin mimetic peptide to the same receptor fragment. The competitive nature of their binding appears to be reflected in a previously undetected sequence similarity between the IR alphaCT peptide and the Site 1 mimetic peptide. In contrast, a prototypical &quot;Site 2&quot; peptide has very limited affinity for IR485. Taken together, these results complement our recent observation that there is a possible structural relationship between these mimetic peptides and insulin itself. They also add support to the view that the segment of unexplained electron density lying on the surface of the central beta-sheet of the L1 domain in the IR ectodomain crystal structure arises from the IR alphaCT peptide. Finally, we show that mutation of the critical IR alphaCT peptide residue Phe714 to alanine does not affect the peptide's affinity for IR485 and conclude that the resultant loss of insulin binding with this mutation results from loss of interaction of the phenylalanine side chain with insulin."
19448621,0,Neurogenetics,9709714,2009,Mitochondrial ND3 as the novel causative gene for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dystonia.,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dystonia (LDYT) is a mitochondrial disorder associated with variable combinations of vision loss and progressive generalized dystonia. LDYT is a unique oxidative phosphorylation disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial ND6 or ND4 gene. In this paper, we describe a Chinese family with 18 LDYT patients. The comprehensive nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome using resequencing microarray revealed a mutation (mtND3*10197A (m.10197G&gt;A)) substituting a threonine for a highly conserved alanine at codon 47 of MTND3 on the background of haplogroup D4b. Quantitative analysis of the heteroplasmy of the mutation revealed a homoplasmy in the leukocytes of all the affected individuals on the maternal side. This is the first description of the ND3 mutation causing LDYT. The mtND3*10197A (m.10197G&gt;A) mutation has recently been described in French and Korean patients with Leigh syndrome. These findings suggest that the clinical presentations associated with the mtND3*10197A (m.10197G&gt;A) mutation (ND3) are much wider, encompassing those of LDYT and Leigh syndrome."
19448624,1,Nature,410462,2009,Crystal structure of the sodium-potassium pump at 2.4 A resolution.,"Sodium-potassium ATPase is an ATP-powered ion pump that establishes concentration gradients for Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane in all animal cells by pumping Na(+) from the cytoplasm and K(+) from the extracellular medium. Such gradients are used in many essential processes, notably for generating action potentials. Na(+), K(+)-ATPase is a member of the P-type ATPases, which include sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and gastric H(+), K(+)-ATPase, among others, and is the target of cardiac glycosides. Here we describe a crystal structure of this important ion pump, from shark rectal glands, consisting of alpha- and beta-subunits and a regulatory FXYD protein, all of which are highly homologous to human ones. The ATPase was fixed in a state analogous to E2.2K(+).P(i), in which the ATPase has a high affinity for K(+) and still binds P(i), as in the first crystal structure of pig kidney enzyme at 3.5 A resolution. Clearly visualized now at 2.4 A resolution are coordination of K(+) and associated water molecules in the transmembrane binding sites and a phosphate analogue (MgF(4)(2-)) in the phosphorylation site. The crystal structure shows that the beta-subunit has a critical role in K(+) binding (although its involvement has previously been suggested) and explains, at least partially, why the homologous Ca(2+)-ATPase counter-transports H(+) rather than K(+), despite the coordinating residues being almost identical."

Decades of study have shown that such sodium-coupled transporters are involved in many physiological processes, making them targets for the treatment of numerous diseases.

These atomic-resolution structures are revealing the mechanism of the sodium-coupled transport of solutes across cellular membranes."
19448637,0,Nature,410462,2009,Reconstitution of Rab- and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion by synthetic endosomes.,"Rab GTPases and SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are evolutionarily conserved essential components of the eukaryotic intracellular transport system. Although pairing of cognate SNAREs is sufficient to fuse membranes in vitro, a complete reconstitution of the Rab-SNARE machinery has never been achieved. Here we report the reconstitution of the early endosomal canine Rab5 GTPase, its key regulators and effectors together with SNAREs into proteoliposomes using a set of 17 recombinant human proteins. These vesicles behave like minimal 'synthetic' endosomes, fusing with purified early endosomes or with each other in vitro. Membrane fusion measured by content-mixing and morphological assays requires the cooperativity between Rab5 effectors and cognate SNAREs which, together, form a more efficient 'core machinery' than SNAREs alone. In reconstituting a fusion mechanism dependent on both a Rab GTPase and SNAREs, our work shows that the two machineries act coordinately to increase the specificity and efficiency of the membrane tethering and fusion process."
19448671,0,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Collision judgment when using an augmented-vision head-mounted display device.,"PURPOSE: A device was developed to provide an expanded visual field to patients with tunnel vision by superimposing minified edge images of the wide scene, in which objects appear closer to the heading direction than they really are. Experiments were conducted in a virtual environment to determine whether users would overestimate collision risks. METHODS: Given simulated scenes of walking or standing with intention to walk toward a given direction (intended walking) in a shopping mall corridor, participants (12 normally sighted and 7 with tunnel vision) reported whether they would collide with obstacles appearing at different offsets from variable walking paths (or intended directions), with and without the device. The collision envelope (CE), a personal space based on perceived collision judgments, and judgment uncertainty (variability of response) were measured. When the device was used, combinations of two image scales (5x minified and 1:1) and two image types (grayscale or edge images) were tested. RESULTS: Image type did not significantly alter collision judgment (P &gt; 0.7). Compared to the without-device baseline, minification did not significantly change the CE of normally sighted subjects for simulated walking (P = 0.12), but increased CE by 30% for intended walking (P &lt; 0.001). Their uncertainty was not affected by minification (P &gt; 0.25). For the patients, neither CE nor uncertainty was affected by minification (P &gt; 0.13) in both walking conditions. Baseline CE and uncertainty were greater for patients than normally sighted subjects in simulated walking (P = 0.03), but the two groups were not significantly different in all other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Users did not substantially overestimate collision risk, as the x5 minified images had only limited impact on collision judgments either during walking or before starting to walk."
19448673,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Accumulation of large protein fragments in prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells.,"PURPOSE: Senescence of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was designed to improve the understanding of proteomic changes that underlie RPE senescence. Specifically, the levels of several protein fragments in prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells were quantitatively compared with those in control cells. METHODS: Premature senescence of human ARPE-19 cells was induced by repeated treatments with 6 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide (tert-BHP). Whole senescent cells were then treated with deuterated D(3)-acrylamide, and control cells were treated with normal D(0)-acrylamide. The D(3) and D(0) samples were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and the proteins were separated by FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) and 2D-PAGE (two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After in-gel trypsinolysis, the relative quantification of selected proteins and fragments in the senescent cells versus control ARPE-19 cells was achieved by calculating the ratio of signal intensities for the deuterated and normal forms of cysteine-containing labeled peptides in MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry) spectra. RESULTS: Several large fragments of typical cytosolic proteins, such as GAPDH, triosephosphate isomerase, and M2-type pyruvate kinase increased approximately two- to threefold in the prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first demonstration that large fragments of cytosolic proteins can be accumulated in prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells, the in vitro model of AMD. These data suggest that protein degradation processes are impaired in these cells and point to a new type of &quot;waste&quot; material in post-mitotic cells that may contribute to the senescent phenotype."

Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE-REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L.). RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of RMS restored fertility to a CMS plant, whereas its overexpression in the fertility restorer line induced pollen abortion. The mRNA expression level of RMS in mature anthers depended on cytoplasmic genotype, suggesting that RMS is a candidate gene to be regulated via retrograde signaling. We found that a reduced-expression allele of the RMS gene restored fertility in haploid pollen, whereas a normal-expression allele caused pollen to die in the CW-type CMS. RMS encodes a mitochondrial protein, 178 aa in length, of unknown function, unlike the majority of other Rf genes cloned thus far, which encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. The unique features of RMS provide novel insights into retrograde signaling and CMS."

In adult tissues, cell fusion has been shown to play an active role in tissue regeneration and repair, and its frequency of occurrence is significantly increased during chronic inflammation. Fusion between tumor cells and normal cells, or among tumor cells themselves, has also been speculated to contribute to tumor initiation, as well as phenotypic evolution during cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we show that dual metastasis organotropisms can be acquired in the same cell through in vitro or in vivo spontaneous fusion between bone- and lung-tropic sublines of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line. The synkaryonic hybrids assimilate organ-specific metastasis gene signatures from both parental cells and are genetically and phenotypically stable. Our study suggests cell fusion as an efficient means of phenotypic evolution during tumor progression and additionally demonstrates the compatibility of different metastasis organotropisms."

TcapQ, a cell-penetrating, near-infrared fluorescent peptide probe designed to be optically silent through intramolecular fluorescence quenching and activated by effector caspases, has been previously described and validated in vitro. Herein, using NMDA-induced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), representing an in vivo rat model of glaucoma, we assessed the ability of TcapQ to image single-cell apoptosis through effector caspase activity. Following intravitreal injection, intracellular TcapQ activation occurred specifically in RGCs, identified individual apoptotic cells, showed a clear dose-response relationship with NMDA, and colocalized with TUNEL labeling in the retina. There was a significant diminution of probe activation following pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of caspase-3. Stereospecificity was also exhibited by the lack of intracellular fluorescence upon administration of the noncleavable isomer, dTcapQ. TcapQ has potential utility in detecting and monitoring single-cell apoptosis in glaucoma in vivo."

Neural responses were sorted on the basis of the trial-to-trial visibility of the stimulus, as reported by the animals. We found that neurons in the dorsal and ventral pulvinar, but not the LGN, showed changes in spiking rate according to stimulus visibility. Passive viewing control sessions showed such modulation to be independent of the monkeys' active report. Perceptual suppression was also accompanied by a marked drop in low-frequency power (9-30 Hz) of the local field potential (LFP) throughout the visual thalamus, but this modulation was not observed during passive viewing. Our findings demonstrate that visual responses of pulvinar neurons reflect the perceptual awareness of a stimulus, while those of LGN neurons do not."
19450461,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores facilitates somatodendritic dopamine release.,"Somatodendritic dopamine (DA) release in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) shows a limited dependence on extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)), suggesting the involvement of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Here, using immunocytochemistry we demonstrate the presence of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 (SERCA2) that sequesters cytosolic Ca(2+) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in DAergic neurons. Notably, RyRs were clustered at the plasma membrane, poised for activation by Ca(2+) entry. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to monitor evoked extracellular DA concentration ([DA](o)) in midbrain slices, we found that SERCA inhibition by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) decreased evoked [DA](o) in the SNc, indicating a functional role for ER Ca(2+) stores in somatodendritic DA release. Implicating IP(3)R-dependent stores, an IP(3)R antagonist, 2-APB, also decreased evoked [DA](o). Moreover, DHPG, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s, which couple to IP(3) production), increased somatodendritic DA release, whereas CPCCOEt, an mGluR1 antagonist, suppressed it. Release suppression by mGluR1 blockade was prevented by 2-APB or CPA, indicating facilitation of DA release by endogenous glutamate acting via mGluR1s and IP(3)R-gated Ca(2+) stores. Similarly, activation of RyRs by caffeine increased [Ca(2+)](i) and elevated evoked [DA](o). The increase in DA release was prevented by a RyR blocker, dantrolene, and by CPA. Importantly, the efficacy of dantrolene was enhanced in low [Ca(2+)](o), suggesting a mechanism for maintenance of somatodendritic DA release with limited Ca(2+) entry. Thus, both mGluR1-linked IP(3)R- and RyR-dependent ER Ca(2+) stores facilitate somatodendritic DA release in the SNc."
19450468,0,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Stress-induced phenotypic switching in Candida albicans.,"Candida albicans is both a common commensal and an opportunistic pathogen, being a prevalent cause of mucosal and systemic infections in humans. Phenotypic switching between white and opaque forms is a reversible transition that influences virulence, mating behavior, and biofilm formation. In this work, we show that a wide range of factors induces high rates of switching from white to opaque. These factors include different forms of environmental stimuli such as genotoxic and oxidative stress, as well as intrinsic factors such as mutations in DNA repair genes. We propose that these factors increase switching to the opaque phase via a common mechanism-inhibition of cell growth. To confirm this hypothesis, growth rates were artificially manipulated by varying expression of the CLB4 cyclin gene; slowing cell growth by depleting CLB4 resulted in a concomitant increase in white-opaque switching. Furthermore, two clinical isolates of C. albicans, P37005 and L26, were found to naturally exhibit both slow growth and high rates of white-opaque switching. Notably, suppression of the slow growth phenotype suppressed hyperswitching in the P37005 isolate. Based on the sensitivity of the switch to levels of the master regulator Wor1, we propose a model for how changes in cellular growth modulate white-opaque switching frequencies."
19450472,0,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Gap junction turnover is achieved by the internalization of small endocytic double-membrane vesicles.,"Double-membrane-spanning gap junction (GJ) channels cluster into two-dimensional arrays, termed plaques, to provide direct cell-to-cell communication. GJ plaques often contain circular, channel-free domains ( approximately 0.05-0.5 mum in diameter) identified &gt;30 y ago and termed nonjunctional membrane (NM) domains. We show, by expressing the GJ protein connexin43 (Cx43) tagged with green fluorescent protein, or the novel photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra2, that NM domains appear to be remnants generated by the internalization of small GJ channel clusters that bud over time from central plaque areas. Channel clusters internalized within seconds forming endocytic double-membrane GJ vesicles ( approximately 0.18-0.27 mum in diameter) that were degraded by lysosomal pathways. Surprisingly, NM domains were not repopulated by surrounding channels and instead remained mobile, fused with each other, and were expelled at plaque edges. Quantification of internalized, photoconverted Cx43-Dendra2 vesicles indicated a GJ half-life of 2.6 h that falls within the estimated half-life of 1-5 h reported for GJs. Together with previous publications that revealed continuous accrual of newly synthesized channels along plaque edges and simultaneous removal of channels from plaque centers, our data suggest how the known dynamic channel replenishment of functional GJ plaques can be achieved. Our observations may have implications for the process of endocytic vesicle budding in general."

Unexpectedly, JA-Trp caused agravitropic root growth in seedlings, unlike JA or nine other JA-amino acid conjugates. The response was dose dependent from 1 to 100 microm, was independent of the COI1 jasmonate signaling locus, and unlike the jasmonate signal JA-isoleucine, JA-Trp minimally inhibited root growth. The Trp conjugate with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA-Trp) produced a similar response, while Trp alone and conjugates with benzoic and cinnamic acids did not. JA-Trp and IAA-Trp at 25 microm nearly eliminated seedling root inhibition caused by 2 microm IAA. The TIR1 auxin receptor is required for activity because roots of tir1-1 grew only approximately 60% of wild-type length on IAA plus JA-Trp, even though tir1-1 is auxin resistant. However, neither JA-Trp nor IAA-Trp interfered with IAA-dependent interaction between TIR1 and Aux/IAA7 in cell-free assays. Trp conjugates inhibited IAA-stimulated lateral root production and DR5-beta-glucuronidase gene expression. JA-deficient mutants were hypersensitive to IAA and a Trp-overaccumulating mutant was less sensitive, suggesting endogenous conjugates affect auxin sensitivity. Conjugates were present at 5.8 pmol g(-1) fresh weight or less in roots, seedlings, leaves, and flowers, and the values increased approximately 10-fold in roots incubated in 25 microm Trp and IAA or JA at 2 microm. These results show that JA-Trp and IAA-Trp constitute a previously unrecognized mechanism to regulate auxin action."
19450480,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Plant physiological adaptations to the massive foreign protein synthesis occurring in recombinant chloroplasts.,"Genetically engineered chloroplasts have an extraordinary capacity to accumulate recombinant proteins. We have investigated in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) the possible consequences of such additional products on several parameters of plant development and composition. Plastid transformants were analyzed that express abundantly either bacterial enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (PhoA-S and PhoA-L) and 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), or a green fluorescent protein (GFP). In leaves, the HPPD and GFP recombinant proteins are the major polypeptides and accumulate to higher levels than Rubisco. Nevertheless, these engineered metabolic sinks do not cause a measurable difference in growth rate or photosynthetic parameters. The total amino acid content of transgenic leaves is also not significantly affected, showing that plant cells have a limited protein biosynthetic capacity. Recombinant products are made at the expense of resident proteins. Rubisco, which constitutes the major leaf amino acid store, is the most clearly and strongly down-regulated plant protein. This reduction is even more dramatic under conditions of limited nitrogen supply, whereas recombinant proteins accumulate to even higher relative levels. These changes are regulated posttranscriptionally since transcript levels of resident plastid genes are not affected. Our results show that plants are able to produce massive amounts of recombinant proteins in chloroplasts without profound metabolic perturbation and that Rubisco, acting as a nitrogen buffer, is a key player in maintaining homeostasis and limiting pleiotropic effects."
19450497,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,CDKB1;1 forms a functional complex with CYCA2;3 to suppress endocycle onset.,"The mitosis-to-endocycle transition requires the controlled inactivation of M phase-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Previously, the B-type CDKB1;1 was identified as an important negative regulator of endocycle onset. Here, we demonstrate that CDKB1;1 copurifies and associates with the A2-type cyclin CYCA2;3. Coexpression of CYCA2;3 with CDKB1;1 triggered ectopic cell divisions and inhibited endoreduplication. Moreover, the enhanced endoreduplication phenotype observed after overexpression of a dominant-negative allele of CDKB1;1 could be partially complemented by CYCA2;3 co-overexpression, illustrating that both subunits unite in vivo to form a functional complex. CYCA2;3 protein stability was found to be controlled by CCS52A1, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex. We conclude that CCS52A1 participates in endocycle onset by down-regulating CDKB1;1 activity through the destruction of CYCA2;3."
19450499,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Energy-dependent immunity protein release during tol-dependent nuclease colicin translocation.,"Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor in the outer membrane of sensitive cells in the form of a high affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. Upon cell entry the immunity protein is lost from the complex by means that are poorly understood. We have developed a sensitive fluorescence assay that has enabled us to study the molecular requirements for immunity protein release. Nuclease colicins use members of the tol operon for their translocation across the outer membrane. We have demonstrated that the amino-terminal 80 residues of the colicin E9 molecule, which is the region that interacts with TolB, are essential for immunity protein release. Using tol deletion strains we analyzed the cellular components necessary for immunity protein release and found that in addition to a requirement for tolB, the tolA deletion strain was most affected. Complementation studies showed that the mutation H22A, within the transmembrane segment of TolA, abolishes immunity protein release. Investigation of the energy requirements demonstrated that the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane is critical. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time a clear energy requirement for the uptake of a nuclease colicin complex and suggest that energy transduced from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane by TolA could be the driving force for immunity protein release and concomitant translocation of the nuclease domain."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,A familial mutation renders atrial natriuretic Peptide resistant to proteolytic degradation.,"A heterozygous frameshift mutation causing a 12-amino acid extension to the C terminus of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was recently genetically linked to patients with familial atrial fibrillation (Hodgson-Zingman, D. M., Karst, M. L., Zingman, L. V., Heublein, D. M., Darbar, D., Herron, K. J., Ballew, J. D., de Andrade, M., Burnett, J. C., Jr., and Olson, T. M. (2008) N. Engl. J. Med. 359, 158-165). The frameshift product (fsANP), but not wild-type ANP (wtANP), was elevated in the serum of affected patients, but the molecular basis for the elevated peptide concentrations was not determined. Here, we measured the ability of fsANP to interact with natriuretic peptide receptors and to be proteolytically degraded. fsANP and wtANP bound and activated human NPR-A and NPR-C similarly, whereas fsANP had a slightly increased efficacy for human NPR-B. Proteolytic susceptibility was addressed with novel bioassays that measure the time required for kidney membranes or purified neutral endopeptidase to abolish ANP-dependent activation of NPR-A. The half-life of fsANP was markedly greater than that of wtANP in both assays. Additional membrane proteolysis studies indicated that wtANP and fsANP are preferentially degraded by neutral endopeptidase and serine peptidases, respectively. These data indicate that the familial ANP mutation associated with atrial fibrillation has only minor effects on natriuretic peptide receptor interactions but markedly modifies peptide proteolysis."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Generation of mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells by transient expression of a single nonviral polycistronic vector.,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have generated keen interest due to their potential use in regenerative medicine. They have been obtained from various cell types of both mice and humans by exogenous delivery of different combinations of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, and Lin28. The delivery of these transcription factors has mostly entailed the use of integrating viral vectors (retroviruses or lentiviruses), carrying the risk of both insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis due to misexpression of these exogenous factors. Therefore, obtaining iPS cells that do not carry integrated transgene sequences is an important prerequisite for their eventual therapeutic use. Here we report the generation of iPS cell lines from mouse embryonic fibroblasts with no evidence of integration of the reprogramming vector in their genome, achieved by nucleofection of a polycistronic construct coexpressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc."
19450514,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Cryo-electron microscopy structure of adenovirus type 2 temperature-sensitive mutant 1 reveals insight into the cell entry defect.,"The structure of the adenovirus type 2 temperature-sensitive mutant 1 (Ad2ts1) was determined to a resolution of 10 A by cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction. Ad2ts1 was prepared at a nonpermissive temperature and contains the precursor forms of the capsid proteins IIIa, VI, and VIII; the core proteins VII, X (mu), and terminal protein (TP); and the L1-52K protein. Cell entry studies have shown that although Ad2ts1 can bind the coxsackievirus and Ad receptor and undergo internalization via alphav integrins, this mutant does not escape from the early endosome and is targeted for degradation. Comparison of the Ad2ts1 structure to that of mature Ad indicates that Ad2ts1 has a different core architecture. The Ad2ts1 core is closely associated with the icosahedral capsid, a connection which may be mediated by preproteins IIIa and VI. Density within hexon cavities is assigned to preprotein VI, and membrane disruption assays show that hexon shields the lytic activity of both the mature and precursor forms of protein VI. The internal surface of the penton base in Ad2ts1 appears to be anchored to the core by interactions with preprotein IIIa. Our structural analyses suggest that these connections to the core inhibit the release of the vertex proteins and lead to the cell entry defect of Ad2ts1."
19450525,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Formation of syncytia is repressed by tetraspanins in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-producing cells.,"In vitro propagation studies have established that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is most efficiently transmitted at the virological synapse that forms between producer and target cells. Despite the presence of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and CD4 and chemokine receptors at the respective surfaces, producer and target cells usually do not fuse with each other but disengage after the viral particles have been delivered, consistent with the idea that syncytia, at least in vitro, are not required for HIV-1 spread. Here, we tested whether tetraspanins, which are well known regulators of cellular membrane fusion processes that are enriched at HIV-1 exit sites, regulate syncytium formation. We found that overexpression of tetraspanins in producer cells leads to reduced syncytium formation, while downregulation has the opposite effect. Further, we document that repression of Env-induced cell-cell fusion by tetraspanins depends on the presence of viral Gag, and we demonstrate that fusion repression requires the recruitment of Env by Gag to tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs). However, sensitivity to fusion repression by tetraspanins varied for different viral strains, despite comparable recruitment of their Envs to TEMs. Overall, these data establish tetraspanins as negative regulators of HIV-1-induced cell-cell fusion, and they start delineating the requirements for this regulation."
19450532,1,J. Virol.,113724,2009,Human immunodeficiency virus type 1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses during primary infection are major determinants of the viral set point and loss of CD4+ T cells.,"Primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) is marked by a flu-like syndrome and high levels of viremia that decrease to a viral set point with the first emergence of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Here, we investigated in a large cohort of 527 subjects the immunodominance pattern of the first virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses developed during PHI in comparison to CTL responses in chronic infection and demonstrated a distinct relationship between the early virus-specific CTL responses and the viral set point, as well as the slope of CD4+ T-cell decline. CTL responses during PHI followed clear hierarchical immunodominance patterns that were lost during the transition to chronic infection. Importantly, the immunodominance patterns of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL responses detected in primary, but not in chronic, HIV-1 infection were significantly associated with the subsequent set point of viral replication. Moreover, the preservation of the initial CD8+ T-cell immunodominance patterns from the acute into the chronic phase of infection was significantly associated with slower CD4+ T-cell decline. Taken together, these data show that the specificity of the initial CTL response to HIV is critical for the subsequent control of viremia and have important implications for the rational selection of antigens for future HIV-1 vaccines."
19450545,0,J. Virol.,113724,2009,The paramyxoviruses simian virus 5 and mumps virus recruit host cell CD46 to evade complement-mediated neutralization.,"The complement system is a critical component of the innate immune response that all animal viruses must face during natural infections. Our previous results have shown that treatment of the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5) with human serum results in deposition of complement C3-derived polypeptides on virion particles. Here, we show that the virion-associated C3 component includes the inactive form iC3b, suggesting that SV5 may have mechanisms to evade the host complement system. Electron microscopy, gradient centrifugation, and Western blot analysis indicated that purified SV5 virions derived from human A549 cells contained CD46, a plasma membrane-expressed regulator of complement that acts as a cofactor for cleavage and inactivation of C3b into iC3b. In vitro cleavage assays with purified complement components showed that SV5 virions had C3b cofactor activity, resulting in specific factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b into inactive iC3b. SV5 particles generated in CHO cells, which do not express CD46, did not have cofactor activity. Conversely, virions derived from a CHO cell line that was engineered to overexpress human CD46 contained elevated levels of virion-associated CD46 and displayed enhanced C3b cofactor activity. In comparison with C3b, purified SV5 virions had very low cofactor activity against C4b, consistent with the known preference of CD46 for C3b versus C4b. Similar results were obtained for the closely related mumps virus (MuV), except that MuV particles derived from CHO-CD46 cells had higher C4b cofactor activity than SV5 virions. In neutralization assays with human serum, SV5 and MuV containing CD46 showed slower kinetics and more resistance to neutralization than SV5 and MuV that lacked CD46. Our results support a model in which the rubulaviruses SV5 and MuV incorporate cell surface complement inhibitors into progeny virions as a mechanism to limit complement-mediated neutralization."
19450551,0,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2009,Cancer-related transcriptional targets of the circadian gene NPAS2 identified by genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis.,"The transcription factor NPAS2 is one of nine human core circadian genes that influence a variety of biological processes by regulating the 24-h circadian rhythm. Recently, it has been shown that NPAS2 is a risk biomarker in human cancers and plays a role in tumorigenesis by affecting cancer-related gene expression, and relevant biological pathways. However, it is difficult to study the biological involvement of NPAS2 in cancer development, as little is known about its direct transcriptional targets. The aim of the current study is to create a transcriptional profile of genes regulated by NPAS2, using a human binding ChIP-on-chip analysis of NPAS2 in MCF-7 cells. This genome-wide mapping approach identified 26 genes that contain potential NPAS2 binding regions. Subsequent real-time PCR assays confirmed 16 of these targets, and 9 of these genes (ARHGAP29, CDC25A, CDKN2AIP, CX3CL1, ELF4, GNAL, KDELR1, POU4F2, and THRA) have a known role in tumorigenesis. In addition, a networking analysis of these validated NPAS2 targets revealed that all nine genes, together with REN, are involved in a &quot;Cancer, Cell cycle, Neurological Disease&quot; network. These results report the first list of direct transcriptional targets of NPAS2 and will shed light on the role of circadian genes in tumorigenesis."
19450556,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,PPARgamma and RXRgamma ligands act synergistically as potent antineoplastic agents in vitro and in vivo glioma models.,"Glioblastoma represent the most common primary brain tumor in adults and are currently considered incurable. We investigated antiproliferative and anti-invasive mechanisms of 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyfenantrene (IIF), a retinoid X receptor ligand, and pioglitazone (PGZ), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activator, in three different glioblastoma cell lines. A dose-dependent reduction of tumor invasion and strong decrease of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 expression was observed, especially when a combination therapy of IIF and PGZ was administered. Combined treatment also markedly reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in all glioma cell lines tested. This was in particular accompanied by decrease of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and p53, while simultaneously pro-apoptotic cytochrome c, cleaved caspase 3, Bax and Bad levels increased. These in vitro findings were further substantiated in a murine glioma model in vivo, where oral administration of PGZ and IIF resulted in significantly reduced tumor volume and proliferation. Of note, treatment with nuclear receptor ligands was not only effective when the treatment was initiated shortly after the intraparenchymal seeding of the glioma cells, but even when initiated in the last third of the observation period. Collectively, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a combined treatment of ligands of proliferator-activated receptor and retinoid X receptor against glioblastoma."
19450583,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Neuroprotection of microglial conditioned medium on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neuronal death: role of transforming growth factor beta-2.,"Microglia, the immune cells of the CNS, play essential roles in both physiological and pathological brain states. Here we have used an in vitro model to demonstrate neuroprotection of a 48 h-microglial conditioned medium (MCM) towards cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) challenged with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, which induces a Parkinson-like neurodegeneration, and to identify the protective factor(s). MCM nearly completely protects CGNs from 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity and at least some of the protective factor(s) are peptidic in nature. While the fraction of the medium containing molecules &lt; 30 kDa completely protects CGNs, fractions containing molecules &lt; 10 kDa or &gt; 10 kDa are not neuroprotective. We further demonstrate that microglia release high amounts of transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) and that its exogenous addition to the fraction of the medium not containing it (&lt; 10 kDa) fully restores the neuroprotective action. Moreover, MCM neuroprotection is significantly counteracted by an inhibitor of TGF-beta2 transduction pathway. Our results identify TGF-beta2 as an essential neuroprotective factor released by microglia in its culture medium that requires to be fully effective the concomitant presence of other factor(s) of low molecular weight."
19450587,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Nefiracetam activation of CaM kinase II and protein kinase C mediated by NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors in olfactory bulbectomized mice.,"Aberrant behaviors related to learning and memory in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice have been documented in the previous studies. We reported that the impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA1 regions from OBX mice was associated with down-regulation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) activities. We now demonstrated that the nootropic drug, nefiracetam, significantly improved spatial reference memory-related behaviors as assessed by Y-maze and novel object recognition task in OBX mice. Nefiracetam also restored hippocampal LTP injured in OBX mice. Nefiracetam treatment restored LTP-induced PKCalpha (Ser657) and NR1 (Ser896) phosphorylation as well as increase in their basal phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region of OBX mice. Likewise, nefiracetam improved LTP-induced CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) autophosphorylation and GluR1 (Ser831) phosphorylation and increased their basal phosphorylation. The enhancement of PKCalpha (Ser657) and CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) autophosphorylation by nefiracetam was inhibited by treatment with (+/-)-alpha-Methyl-(4-carboxyphenyl)glycine and DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, respectively. The enhancement of LTP induced by nefiracetam is inhibited by treatment with 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, but not by treatment with LY367385, suggesting that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) but not mGluR1 is involved in the nefiracetam-induced LTP enhancement. Taken together, nefiracetam ameliorates OBX-induced deficits in memory-related behaviors and impairment of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region through activation of NMDAR and mGluR5, thereby leading to an increase in activities of CaMKIIalpha (Thr286) and PKCalpha (Ser657), respectively."
19450588,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Pharmacological evidences for DFK167-sensitive presenilin-independent gamma-secretase-like activity.,"Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides production is thought to be a key event in the neurodegenerative process ultimately leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. A bulk of studies concur to propose that the C-terminal moiety of Abeta is released from its precursor beta-amyloid precursor protein by a high molecular weight enzymatic complex referred to as gamma-secretase, that is composed of at least, nicastrin (NCT), Aph-1, Pen-2, and presenilins (PS) 1 or 2. They are thought to harbor the gamma-secretase catalytic activity. However, several lines of evidence suggest that additional gamma-secretase-like activities could potentially contribute to Abeta production. By means of a quenched fluorimetric substrate (JMV2660) mimicking the beta-amyloid precursor protein sequence targeted by gamma-secretase, we first show that as expected, this probe allows monitoring of an activity detectable in several cell systems including the neuronal cell line telencephalon specific murine neurons (TSM1). This activity is reduced by DFK167, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), and LY68458, three inhibitors known to functionally interact with PS. Interestingly, JMV2660 but not the unrelated peptide JMV2692, inhibits Abeta production in an in vitrogamma-secretase assay as expected from a putative substrate competitor. This activity is enhanced by PS1 and PS2 mutations known to be responsible for familial forms of AD and reduced by aspartyl mutations inactivating PS or in cells devoid of PS or NCT. However, we clearly establish that residual JMV2660-hydrolysing activity could be recovered in PS- and NCT-deficient fibroblasts and that this activity remained inhibited by DFK167. Overall, our study describes the presence of a proteolytic activity displaying gamma-secretase-like properties but independent of PS and still blocked by DFK167, suggesting that the PS-dependent complex could not be the unique gamma-secretase activity responsible for Abeta production and delineates PS-independent gamma-secretase activity as a potential additional therapeutic target to fight AD pathology."
19451214,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Distinct role of growth hormone on epilepsy progression in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common form of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, in which epileptogenic foci propagate to other regions of the brain from the area of the initial insult. The present study focused on epileptogenesis, that is, the development of the first foci inducing seizures in amygdala-kindled mice, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, to find the molecular process promoting the formation of epileptogenic networks. The expression of growth hormone (GH) was up-regulated along neural circuits during the epileptogenesis, while there was no difference in the pituitary gland. The up-regulation was associated with increased phosphorylation/activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and expression of the Serum Response Element-regulated genes, FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene, early growth response 1, and Jun-B oncogene, suggesting that expression of GH leads to GH signaling in the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, the administration of the hormone into the hippocampus markedly enhanced the progression of kindling. The administration of an inhibitor of its secretion into the hippocampus elicited a delay in the progression. Our results demonstrate directly that regulation via growth hormone has a robust impact in epileptogenesis."
19451222,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Effects of the antipsychotic drug haloperidol on the somastostatinergic system in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.,"Antipsychotics are established drugs in schizophrenia treatment which, however, are not free of side effects. Lipid rafts are critical for normal brain function. Several G protein-coupled receptors, such as somatostatin (SRIF) receptors, have been shown to localize to lipid rafts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether haloperidol treatment affects the composition and functionality of lipid rafts in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Haloperidol inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to a marked reduction in cell cholesterol content and to an accumulation of sterol intermediates, particularly cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol. These changes were accompanied by a loss of flotillin-1 and Fyn from the lipid rafts. We next studied the functionality of the SRIF receptor. Treatment with haloperidol reduced the inhibitory effect of SRIF on adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. On the other side, haloperidol decreased basal AC activity but increased forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Addition of free cholesterol to the culture medium abrogated the effects of haloperidol on lipid raft composition and SRIF signaling whereas the AC response to forskolin remained elevated. The results show that haloperidol, by affecting cholesterol homeostasis, ultimately alters SRIF signaling and AC activity, which might have physiological consequences."
19451224,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,RasGRF1 disruption causes retinal photoreception defects and associated transcriptomic alterations.,"RasGRF1 null mutant mice display impaired memory/learning and their hippocampus transcriptomic pattern includes a number of differentially expressed genes playing significant roles in sensory development and function. Odour avoidance and auditory brainstem response tests yielded normal results but electroretinographic analysis showed severe light perception impairment in the RasGRF1 knockouts. Whereas no structural alterations distinguished the retinas of wild-type and knockout mice, microarray transcriptional analysis identified at least 44 differentially expressed genes in the retinas of these Knockout animals. Among these, Crb1, Pttg1, Folh1 and Myo7a have been previously related to syndromes involving retina degeneration. Interestingly, over-expression of Folh1 would be expected to result in accumulation of its enzymatic product N-acetyl-aspartate, an event known to be linked to Canavan disease, a human cerebral degenerative syndrome often involving blindness and hearing loss. Consistently, in vivo brain nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified higher levels of N-acetyl-aspartate in our RasGRF1-/- mice and immunohistochemical analysis detected reduced levels of aspartoacylase, the enzyme which degrades N-acetyl-aspartate. These studies demonstrate for the first time the functional relevance of Ras signalling in mammalian photoreception and warrant further analysis of RasGRF1 Knockout mice as potential models to analyse molecular mechanisms underlying defective photoreception human diseases."
19451228,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,The Parkinson disease-associated A30P mutation stabilizes alpha-synuclein against proteasomal degradation triggered by heme oxygenase-1 over-expression in human neuroblastoma cells.,"Proteosomal degradation of proteins is one of the major mechanisms of intracellular protein turnover. Failure of the proteosome to degrade misfolded protein is implicated in the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme that converts heme to free iron, carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (bilirubin precursor) is expressed in response to various stressors. HO-1 is up-regulated in PD- and Alzheimer's disease-affected neural tissues. In this study, we found that HO-1 over-expression engenders dose-dependent decreases in alpha-synuclein protein levels in human neuroblastoma M17 cells. When over-expression of HO-1 was silenced in HO-1 transfected cells, level of alpha-synuclein was restored. Likewise, treatment of HO-1 over-expressing cells with the HO-1 inhibitor, tin mesoporphyrin, the iron chelator deferoxamine or antagonist of CO-dependent cGMP activation, methylene blue, mitigated the HO-1-induced reduction in alpha-synuclein levels. Furthermore, when HO-1 over-expressing cells were treated with the proteosome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG132, level of alpha-synuclein was almost completely restored. In contrast to the effect on alpha-synuclein [wild-type (WT)] levels, HO-1 over-expression did not significantly impact PD-associated alpha-synuclein (A30P) levels in these cells. HO-1 also significantly reduced aggregation of alpha-synuclein (WT) but not that of A30P. Our results suggest that HO-1, which is expressed when neurons are exposed to toxic stimuli capable of inducing protein misfolding, triggers proteosomal degradation of proteins and prevents intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates and inclusions. Resistance to HO-1 induced proteosomal degradation may render the familial PD-associated A30P mutation prone to toxic intracellular aggregation."
19451242,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Abeta43 is more frequent than Abeta40 in amyloid plaque cores from Alzheimer disease brains.,"One hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the extracellular deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in senile plaques. Two major forms of Abeta are produced, 40 (Abeta40) and 42 (Abeta42) residues long. The most abundant form of Abeta is Abeta40, while Abeta42 is more hydrophobic and more prone to form toxic oligomers and the species of particular importance in early plaque formation. Thus, the length of the hydrophobic C-terminal seems to be very important for the oligomerization and neurotoxicity of the Abeta peptide. Here we investigated which Abeta species are deposited in AD brain. We analyzed plaque cores, prepared from occipital and frontal cortex, from sporadic and familial AD cases and performed a quantitative study using Abeta standard peptides. Cyanogen bromide was used to generate C-terminal Abeta fragments, which were analyzed by HPLC coupled to an electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometer. We found a longer peptide, Abeta43, to be more frequent than Abeta40. No variants longer than Abeta43 could be observed in any of the brains. Immunohistochemistry was performed and was found to be in line with our findings. Abeta1-43 polymerizes rapidly and we suggest that this variant may be of importance for AD."
19451244,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,In vivo over-expression of interleukin-10 increases resistance to focal brain ischemia in mice.,"Early studies showed that the administration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10) protects against permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. In this study, transgenic mice expressing murine IL10 (IL10T) directed by the major histocompatibility complex Ea promoter were produced and used to explore the effect of chronically increased IL10 levels on MCAO-related molecular mechanisms. IL10 was over-expressed in astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial brain cells in IL10T compared with wild type mice. Four days following MCAO, IL10T mice showed a 40% reduction in infarct size which was associated to significantly reduced levels of active caspase 3 compared with wild type mice. Under basal conditions, anti-inflammatory factors such as nerve growth factor and GSH were up-regulated and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1beta was down-regulated in the brain of IL10T animals. In addition, these mice displayed increased basal GSH levels in microglial and endothelial cells as well as a marked increase in manganese superoxide dismutase in endothelial lining blood vessels. Following ischemia, IL10T mice showed a marked reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and IL1beta. Our data indicate that constitutive IL10 over-expression is associated with a striking resistance to cerebral ischemia that may be attributed to changes in the basal redox properties of glial/endothelial cells."
19451245,1,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Vulnerability to glutamate toxicity of dopaminergic neurons is dependent on endogenous dopamine and MAPK activation.,"Dopaminergic neurons are more vulnerable than other types of neurons in cases of Parkinson disease and ischemic brain disease. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that endogenous dopamine plays a role in the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons. Although glutamate toxicity contributes to the pathogenesis of these disorders, the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to glutamate toxicity has not been clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons were preferentially affected by glutamate toxicity in rat mesencephalic cultures. Glutamate toxicity in dopaminergic neurons was blocked by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK. Furthermore, depletion of dopamine by alpha-methyl-dl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (alpha-MT), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), protected dopaminergic neurons from the neurotoxicity. Exposure to glutamate facilitated phosphoryration of TH at Ser31 by ERK, which contributes to the increased TH activity. Inhibition of ERK had no additive effect on the protection offered by alpha-MT, whereas alpha-MT and c-jun N-terminal kinase or p38 MAPK inhibitors had additive effects and yielded full protection. These data suggest that endogenous dopamine is responsible for the vulnerability to glutamate toxicity of dopaminergic neurons and one of the mechanisms may be an enhancement of dopamine synthesis mediated by ERK."
19451267,1,FEBS J.,101229646,2009,Inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB alpha derepresses hypoxia-inducible factor-1 during moderate hypoxia by sequestering factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor from hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha.,"Hypoxia and inflammation often develop concurrently in numerous diseases, and both hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are key transcription factors of stress response genes. An NF-kappaB inhibitor, inhibitor of NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaB alpha), was found to interact with factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) and to be hydroxylated by FIH. However, FIH did not functionally regulate IkappaB alpha, and the consequence of the FIH-IkappaB alpha interaction thus remains uncertain. In the present study, we tested the possibility that IkappaB alpha regulates FIH. FIH-IkappaB alpha binding was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Functionally, IkappaB alpha expression further enhanced the transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, IkappaB alpha knockdown repressed HIF-1alpha activity. Mechanistically, IkappaB alpha derepressed HIF-1alpha activity by inhibiting the FIH-mediated Asn803 hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha. It was also found that IkappaB alpha activated HIF-1alpha by sequestering FIH from HIF-1alpha. However, the effect of IkappaB alpha on HIF-1alpha activity was only observed in atmospheres containing 1% or more of oxygen. After tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment, IkappaB alpha downregulation, Asn803 hydroxylation and HIF-1alpha inactivation all occurred up to 8 h, but subsided later. On the basis of these results, we propose that IkappaB alpha plays a positive regulatory role during HIF-1-mediated gene expression. Therefore, IkappaB alpha, owing to its interactions with NF-kappaB and HIF-1alpha, may play a pivotal role in the crosstalk between the molecular events that underlie inflammatory and hypoxic responses."
19451272,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Elucidating the kinetic mechanism of DNA polymerization catalyzed by Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase B1.,"Transient-state kinetic techniques were used to resolve the kinetic mechanism of DNA polymerization catalyzed by an exonuclease-deficient mutant of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase B1 (PolB1 exo-). Here, we report the kinetic parameters of several elementary steps for the forward polymerization reaction. PolB1 exo- binds tightly to DNA (K(d)(DNA) = 1.8 nM) and a correct incoming nucleotide (apparent K(d)(dTTP) = 11 microM). Moreover, several lines of kinetic evidence suggested that correct nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by PolB1 exo- was limited by a protein conformational change which precedes the chemistry step. The utilization of an &quot;induced fit&quot; mechanism by PolB1 exo- was supported by the following: a small, alpha-thio elemental effect of 1.5, varying DNA dissociation rates for the binary complex (0.043 s(-1)) as well as ternary complexes before (0.18 s(-1)) and after (0.0071 s(-1)) a conformational change, a greater amplitude for the pulse-chase than the pulse-quench reaction, and an activation energy barrier of 38 kcal/mol which is greater than the predicted values of phosphodiester bond formation both in solution and within a polymerase active site. Lastly, PolB1 exo- exhibited a low processivity value of 15, thereby suggesting a protein cofactor confers this replicative DNA polymerase with higher processivity in vivo."

Our results reveal that the CO adsorption sites on the TiO(2)(110)-1 x 1 surface are preferentially located at next-nearest-neighbor five-coordinate Ti atoms close to a bridge-bonded oxygen vacancy (BBO(V)), in contrast to the idea that the BBO(V) itself acts as the adsorption site for CO. The equilibrium distribution of CO adsorption on the TiO(2)(110)-1 x 1 surface can be well-understood according to the calculated adsorption energies of different sites."
19451639,0,Cell Stress Chaperones,9610925,2010,Experimental testing of a mathematical model relevant to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.,"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process, whose complexity led researchers to build mathematical models that could help to identify its crucial steps. In previous works, we theoretically analyzed and numerically simulated a model that describes a pathway from an external stimulus to caspase-3 activation. Here, the results of experiments performed on populations of synchronized cells treated with the inducer Apo2L/TRAIL are reported and are compared with model predictions. In particular, we have compared in vitro and in silico results relevant to the time evolutions of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities, as well as of the dead cells fractions. In addition, the effect of the BAR gene silencing was evaluated. Caspase-3 activation and cell death is faster in silenced than in nonsilenced cells, thus confirming previous simulation results. Interestingly, Apo2L/TRAIL treatment in itself reduces the BAR gene expression. The qualitative agreement between model predictions and cell cultures behavior suggests that the model captures the essential features of the biological process and could be a tool in further studies of caspases activation. In this manuscript, we report the results of in vitro experiments aimed at revealing the dynamics of caspase activation in a cell population. A qualitative agreement between these results and a mathematical model describing a pathway from an external stimulus to caspase-3 activation was obtained, thus showing that the model captures the essential features of the biological process and may be a reliable tool in further studies of caspase activation."
19451650,1,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Migration rules: tumours are conglomerates of self-metastases.,"Tumours are heterogeneous populations composed of different cells types: stem cells with the capacity for self-renewal and more differentiated cells lacking such ability. The overall growth behaviour of a developing neoplasm is determined largely by the combined kinetic interactions of these cells. By tracking the fate of individual cancer cells using agent-based methods in silico, we apply basic rules for cell proliferation, migration and cell death to show how these kinetic parameters interact to control, and perhaps dictate defining spatial and temporal tumour growth dynamics in tumour development. When the migration rate is small, a single cancer stem cell can only generate a small, self-limited clone because of the finite life span of progeny and spatial constraints. By contrast, a high migration rate can break this equilibrium, seeding new clones at sites outside the expanse of older clones. In this manner, the tumour continually 'self-metastasises'. Counterintuitively, when the proliferation capacity is low and the rate of cell death is high, tumour growth is accelerated because of the freeing up of space for self-metastatic expansion. Changes to proliferation and cell death that increase the rate at which cells migrate benefit tumour growth as a whole. The dominating influence of migration on tumour growth leads to unexpected dependencies of tumour growth on proliferation capacity and cell death. These dependencies stand to inform standard therapeutic approaches, which anticipate a positive response to cell killing and mitotic arrest."
19451654,0,Mol. Syst. Biol.,101235389,2009,Protein sequestration generates a flexible ultrasensitive response in a genetic network.,"Ultrasensitive responses are crucial for cellular regulation. Protein sequestration, where an active protein is bound in an inactive complex by an inhibitor, can potentially generate ultrasensitivity. Here, in a synthetic genetic circuit in budding yeast, we show that sequestration of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor by a dominant-negative inhibitor converts a graded transcriptional response into a sharply ultrasensitive response, with apparent Hill coefficients up to 12. A simple quantitative model for this genetic network shows that both the threshold and the degree of ultrasensitivity depend upon the abundance of the inhibitor, exactly as we observed experimentally. The abundance of the inhibitor can be altered by simple mutation; thus, ultrasensitive responses mediated by protein sequestration are easily tuneable. Gene duplication of regulatory homodimers and loss-of-function mutations can create dominant negatives that sequester and inactivate the original regulator. The generation of flexible ultrasensitive responses is an unappreciated adaptive advantage that could explain the frequent evolutionary emergence of dominant negatives."

Biol.,101235389,2009,Targeted tandem affinity purification of PSD-95 recovers core postsynaptic complexes and schizophrenia susceptibility proteins.,"The molecular complexity of mammalian proteomes demands new methods for mapping the organization of multiprotein complexes. Here, we combine mouse genetics and proteomics to characterize synapse protein complexes and interaction networks. New tandem affinity purification (TAP) tags were fused to the carboxyl terminus of PSD-95 using gene targeting in mice. Homozygous mice showed no detectable abnormalities in PSD-95 expression, subcellular localization or synaptic electrophysiological function. Analysis of multiprotein complexes purified under native conditions by mass spectrometry defined known and new interactors: 118 proteins comprising crucial functional components of synapses, including glutamate receptors, K+ channels, scaffolding and signaling proteins, were recovered. Network clustering of protein interactions generated five connected clusters, with two clusters containing all the major ionotropic glutamate receptors and one cluster with voltage-dependent K+ channels. Annotation of clusters with human disease associations revealed that multiple disorders map to the network, with a significant correlation of schizophrenia within the glutamate receptor clusters. This targeted TAP tagging strategy is generally applicable to mammalian proteomics and systems biology approaches to disease."
19452580,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Local differentiation of sugar donor specificity of flavonoid glycosyltransferase in Lamiales.,"Flavonoids are most commonly conjugated with various sugar moieties by UDP-sugar:glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in a lineage-specific manner. Generally, the phylogenetics and regiospecificity of flavonoid UGTs are correlated, indicating that the regiospecificity of UGT differentiated prior to speciation. By contrast, it is unclear how the sugar donor specificity of UGTs evolved. Here, we report the biochemical, homology-modeled, and phylogenetic characterization of flavonoid 7-O-glucuronosyltransferases (F7GAT), which is responsible for producing specialized metabolites in Lamiales plants. All of the Lamiales F7GATs were found to be members of the UGT88-related cluster and specifically used UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA). We identified an Arg residue that is specifically conserved in the PSPG box in the Lamiales F7GATs. Substitution of this Arg with Trp was sufficient to convert the sugar donor specificity of the Lamiales F7GATs from UDPGA to UDP-glucose. Homology modeling of the Lamiales F7GAT suggested that the Arg residue plays a critical role in the specific recognition of anionic carboxylate of the glucuronic acid moiety of UDPGA with its cationic guanidinium moiety. These results support the hypothesis that differentiation of sugar donor specificity of UGTs occurred locally, in specific plant lineages, after establishment of general regiospecificity for the sugar acceptor. Thus, the plasticity of sugar donor specificity explains, in part, the extraordinary structural diversification of phytochemicals."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Disruption of Nrf2 impairs the resolution of hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and inflammation in mice.,"Aberrant tissue repair and persistent inflammation following oxidant-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) can lead to the development and progression of various pulmonary diseases, but the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Hyperoxia is widely used in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, but the effects of this oxidant exposure in patients undergoing recovery from ALI are not clearly understood. Nrf2 has emerged as a crucial transcription factor that regulates oxidant stress through the induction of several detoxifying enzymes and other proteins. Using an experimental model of hyperoxia-induced ALI, we have examined the role of oxidant stress in resolving lung injury and inflammation. We found that when exposed to sublethal (72 h) hyperoxia, Nrf2-deficient, but not wild-type mice, succumbed to death during recovery. When both genotypes were exposed to a shorter period of hyperoxia-induced ALI (48 h), the lungs of Nrf2-deficient mice during recovery exhibited persistent cellular injury, impaired alveolar and endothelial cell regeneration, and persistent cellular infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes. Glutathione (GSH) supplementation in Nrf2-deficient mice immediately after hyperoxia remarkably restored their ability to recover from hyperoxia-induced damage in a manner similar to that of wild-type mice. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that the Nrf2-regulated transcriptional response and, particularly GSH synthesis, is critical for lung tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation in vivo and suggests that a dysfunctional Nrf2-GSH pathway may compromise these processes in vivo."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Miltefosine promotes IFN-gamma-dominated anti-leishmanial immune response.,"Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, resides and replicates as amastigotes within macrophages. The parasite inflicts the disease visceral leishmaniasis by suppressing host cell function. Neither a therapeutic vaccine nor an effective anti-leishmanial drug to reverse the immunosuppression is available. Although miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine or HPC) is a promising orally bioavailable anti-leishmanial drug, its efficacy is seriously compromised by contra-indications in pregnant women. Further rational redesigning of the drug requires studies on its mechanism of action, which is unknown at present. Because miltefosine is proposed to have immunomodulatory functions, we examined whether miltefosine exerts its anti-leishmanial functions by activating macrophages. We observed that miltefosine's anti-leishmanial function was significantly compromised in IFN-gamma-deficient macrophages suggesting the importance of endogenous IFN-gamma in miltefosine-induced anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. Miltefosine induced IFN-gamma, neutralization of which reduced the anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. IFN-gamma responsiveness is reduced in L. donovani-infected macrophages but is significantly restored by miltefosine, as it enhances IFN-gamma receptors and IFN-gamma induced STAT-1 phosphorylation but reduced activation of SHP-1, the phosphatase implicated in the down-regulation of STAT-1 phosphorylation. Miltefosine induced protein kinase C-dependent and PI3K-dependent p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and anti-leishmanial function. Miltefosine promotes p38MAP kinase-dependent anti-leishmanial functions and IL-12-dependent Th1 response. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages induced Th2 response but miltefosine treatment reversed the response to Th1-type. Thus, our data define for the first time the mechanistic basis of host cell-dependent anti-leishmanial function of miltefosine."
19453177,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,The UDP-glucose receptor P2RY14 triggers innate mucosal immunity in the female reproductive tract by inducing IL-8.,"Innate mucosal immune responses, including recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns through Toll-like receptors, play an important role in preventing infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT). Damaged cells release nucleotides, including ATP and uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose), during inflammation and mechanical stress. We show in this report that P2RY14, a membrane receptor for UDP-glucose, is exclusively expressed in the epithelium, but not the stroma, of the FRT in humans and mice. P2RY14 and several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, are up-regulated in the endometria of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease. UDP-glucose stimulated IL-8 production via P2RY14 in human endometrial epithelial cells but not stromal cells. Furthermore, UDP-glucose enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis in the presence of a human endometrial epithelial cell line in an IL-8-dependent manner. Administration of UDP-glucose into the mouse uterus induced expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine, two murine chemokines that are functional homologues of IL-8, and augmented endometrial neutrophil recruitment. Reduced expression of P2RY14 by small interfering RNA gene silencing attenuated LPS- or UDP-glucose-induced leukocytosis in the mouse uterus. These results suggest that UDP-glucose and its receptor P2RY14 are key front line players able to trigger innate mucosal immune responses in the FRT bypassing the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Our findings would significantly impact the strategic design of therapies to modulate mucosal immunity by targeting P2RY14."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Fatty acyl structures of mycobacterium tuberculosis sulfoglycolipid govern T cell response.,"CD1b-restricted T lymphocytes recognize a large diversity of mycobacterial lipids, which differ in their hydrophilic heads and the structure of their acyl appendages. Both moieties participate in the antigenicity of lipid Ags, but the structural constraints governing binding to CD1b and generation of antigenic CD1b:lipid Ag complexes are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the structural requirements conferring antigenicity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis sulfoglycolipid Ags using a combination of CD1b:lipid binding and T cell activation assays with both living dendritic cells and plate-bound recombinant soluble CD1b. Comparison of the antigenicity of a panel of synthetic analogs, sharing the same trehalose-sulfate polar head, but differing in the structure of their acyl tails, shows that the number of C-methyl substituents on the fatty acid, the configuration of the chiral centers, and the respective localization of the two different acyl chains on the sugar moiety govern TCR recognition and T lymphocyte activation. These studies have major implications for the design of sulfoglycolipid analogs with potential use as tuberculosis subunit vaccines."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,CD45-mediated fodrin cleavage during galectin-1 T cell death promotes phagocytic clearance of dying cells.,"Disassembly and phagocytic removal of dying cells is critical to maintain immune homeostasis. The factors that regulate fragmentation and uptake of dying lymphocytes are not well understood. Degradation of fodrin, a cytoskeletal linker molecule that attaches CD45 to the actin cytoskeleton, has been described in apoptotic cells, although no specific initiator of fodrin degradation has been identified. CD45 is a glycoprotein receptor for galectin-1, an endogenous lectin that can trigger lymphocyte apoptosis, although CD45 is not required for phosphatidylserine externalization or DNA degradation during galectin-1 death. In this study, we show that fodrin degradation occurs during galectin-1 T cell death and that CD45 is essential for fodrin degradation to occur. In the absence of CD45, or if fodrin degradation is prevented, galectin-1-induced cell death is not accompanied by membrane blebbing, although phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA degradation proceed, indicating that fodrin degradation occurs via a distinct pathway compared with the pathway that leads to these other hallmarks of cell death. Moreover, there is slower phagocytic uptake by macrophages of T cells in which fodrin degradation is prevented, relative to T cells in which CD45-mediated fodrin degradation occurs. These studies identify a novel role for CD45 in regulating cellular disassembly and promoting phagocytic clearance during galectin-1-induced T cell death."
19453374,0,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,"Control of thymic T cell maturation, deletion and egress by the RNA-binding protein HuR.","HuR emerged as a posttranscriptional regulator of mRNAs involved in cellular control, stress, and immunity but its role in governing such responses remains elusive. In this study, we assessed HuR's role in the staged progression of thymic T cell differentiation by means of its genetic ablation. Mice with an early deletion of HuR in thymocytes possess enlarged thymi but display a substantial loss of peripheral T cells. We show that this discordant phenotype related to specific defects in thymic cellular processes, which demonstrated HuR's involvement in: 1) intrinsic checkpoint signals suppressing the cell cycle of immature thymocyte progenitors, 2) TCR and antigenic signals promoting the activation and positive selection of mature thymocytes, 3) antigenic and death-receptor signals promoting thymocyte deletion, and 4) chemokine signals driving the egress of postselection thymocytes to the periphery. The cellular consequences of HuR's dysfunction were underlined by the aberrant expression of selective cell cycle regulators, TCR, and death-receptor signaling components. Our studies reveal the signal-dependent context of HuR's cellular activities in thymocytes and its importance in the generation of a physiological T cell pool."
19453375,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,PD-1-mediated suppression of IL-2 production induces CD8+ T cell anergy in vivo.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that PD-1, an immuno-inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells, regulates peripheral T cell tolerance. In particular, PD-1 is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T cells' intrinsic unresponsiveness to previously encountered Ags, although the mechanism is yet to be determined. We used a simple experimental model to dissect the mechanism for anergy establishment, in which 2C TCR transgenic rag2(-/-) PD-1(+/+) mice were anergized by a single injection of a cognate peptide. Interestingly, 2C rag2(-/-) PD-1(-/-) mice were totally resistant to anergy induction by the same treatment; thus, PD-1 was responsible for anergy induction. Furthermore, PD-1 expression was induced within 24 h of the initial Ag exposure. The establishment of anergy was associated with a marked down-regulation of IL-2 from the CD8(+) T cells. In fact, IL-2 blockade resulted in anergy even in 2C rag2(-/-)PD-1(-/-) T cells. Furthermore, the complementation of the IL-2 signal in 2C rag2(-/-) PD-1(+/+) mice reversed the anergy induction. We propose that CD8(+) T cell anergy is induced by a reduction of cell-autonomous IL-2 synthesis, which is caused by the quick expression of PD-1 in response to Ag stimulation and the subsequent stimulation of this receptor by its ligands on surrounding cells."
19454024,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Cutting edge: TCR stimulation is sufficient for induction of Foxp3 expression in the absence of DNA methyltransferase 1.,"TCR signaling is important for regulatory T cell (Tr) development. Using a genetic model of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) deficiency, we observed highly efficient Foxp3 induction following TCR stimulation, suggesting a dominant role for TCR signaling in Foxp3 induction. In the absence of Dnmt1, Foxp3 induction in thymic and peripheral Foxp3-negative T cells was maximized upon TCR engagement, and the provision of TGF-beta was dispensable for Foxp3 expression. In addition, CD4-Cre x dnmt1(fl/fl) mice harbored sizeable thymic and peripheral populations of CD8(+)Foxp3(+) cells, suggesting that Dnmt1 activity is required for restricting Foxp3 expression to the CD4 T cell lineage. Our results suggest that the TCR signal is sufficient for transcriptional activation of Foxp3 in the absence of maintenance DNA methylation and that TGF-beta facilitates Foxp3 induction in part by opposing cell cycle-dependent Dnmt1 recruitment, leading to locus inactivation."
19454280,0,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation by optimization of a differential-high resolution melt analysis protocol.,"DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene transcription. Alterations in DNA methylation patterns are common in most cancers, occur early in carcinogenesis and can be detected in body fluids. Reliable and sensitive quantitative assays are required to improve the diagnostic role of methylation in the management of cancer patients. Here we present an optimized procedure, based on differential-high resolution melting analysis (D-HRMA), for the rapid and accurate quantification of methylated DNA. Two sets of primers are used in a single tube for the simultaneous amplification of the methylated (M) and unmethylated (Um) DNA sequences in D-HRMA. After HRM, differential fluorescence was calculated at the specific melting temperature after automatic subtraction of UM-DNA fluorescence. Quantification was calculated by interpolation on an external standard curve generated by serial dilutions of M-DNA. To optimize the protocol, nine primer sets were accurately selected on the basis of the number of CpG on promoters of hTERT and Bcl2 genes. The use of optimized D-HRMA allowed us to detect up to 0.025% M-DNA. D-HRMA results of DNA from 85 bladder cancers were comparable to those obtained with real time quantitative methylation specific PCR. In addition, D-HRMA appears suitable for rapid and efficient measurements in 'in vitro' experiments on methylation patterns after treatment with demethylating drugs."

We have here used this special opportunity to identify rare alleles in autism by genealogically tracing 20 autism families into one extended pedigree with verified genealogical links reaching back to the 17th century. In this unique pedigree, we performed a dense microsatellite marker genome-wide scan of linkage and LD and followed initial findings with extensive fine-mapping. We identified a putative autism susceptibility locus at 19p13.3 and obtained further evidence for previously identified loci at 1q23 and 15q11-q13. Most promising candidate genes were TLE2 and TLE6 clustered at 19p13 and ATP1A2 at 1q23."

19454604,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Thrombin regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human monocytes.,"We investigated whether thrombin, the final activator of coagulation cascade, regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 in human monocytes. We show that thrombin stimulation induced MMP-9 secretion of monocytes dose- and time-dependently as revealed by gelatin zymography. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that thrombin up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9. Pre-incubation with anti-protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 or anti-PAR-3 antibody partially inhibited the thrombin-induced MMP-9 secretion. Simultaneous incubation with both showed synergistic effect, indicating the involvement of both receptors in this thrombin effect. BAPTA, a Ca(2+) chelator, abolished the thrombin-induced MMP-9 secretion, indicating the requirement of Ca(2+) mobilization in this process. Inhibition of thrombin-induced MMP-9 secretion by either MEK inhibitor or p38 kinase inhibitor revealed that the thrombin effect was mediated by both ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. The activation of NFkappaB by thrombin as demonstrated by electromobility shift assay was also shown to be critical to the thrombin-induced MMP-9 up-regulation."
19454658,0,BMC Struct. Biol.,101088689,2009,Conformational flexibility and molecular interactions of an archaeal homologue of the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein.,"BACKGROUND: Defects in the human Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) protein-coding gene lead to the autosomal recessive disorder characterised by bone marrow dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and skeletal abnormalities. This protein is highly conserved in eukaryotes and archaea but is not found in bacteria. Although genomic and biophysical studies have suggested involvement of this protein in RNA metabolism and in ribosome biogenesis, its interacting partners remain largely unknown. RESULTS: We determined the crystal structure of the SBDS orthologue from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (mthSBDS). This structure shows that SBDS proteins are highly flexible, with the N-terminal FYSH domain and the C-terminal ferredoxin-like domain capable of undergoing substantial rotational adjustments with respect to the central domain. Affinity chromatography identified several proteins from the large ribosomal subunit as possible interacting partners of mthSBDS. Moreover, SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) experiments, combined with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) suggest that mthSBDS does not interact with RNA molecules in a sequence specific manner. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that functional interactions of SBDS proteins with their partners could be facilitated by rotational adjustments of the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains with respect to the central domain. Examination of the SBDS protein structure and domain movements together with its possible interaction with large ribosomal subunit proteins suggest that these proteins could participate in ribosome function."
19454662,0,J. Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,Phosphorylation status of the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor regulates its interaction with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.,"Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptor at excitatory synapses causes activation of post-synaptic Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) and its translocation to the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor. The major binding site for CaMKII on NR2B undergoes phosphorylation at Ser1303, in vivo. Even though some regulatory effects of this phosphorylation are known, the mode of dephosphorylation of NR2B-Ser1303 is still unclear. We show that phosphorylation status at Ser1303 enables NR2B to distinguish between the Ca(2+)/calmodulin activated form and the autonomously active Thr286-autophosphorylated form of CaMKII. Green fluorescent protein-alpha-CaMKII co-expressed with NR2B sequence in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was used to study intracellular binding between the two proteins. Binding in vitro was studied by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. Thr286-autophosphorylated alpha-CaMKII or the autophosphorylation mimicking mutant, T286D-alpha-CaMKII, binds NR2B sequence independent of Ca(2+)/calmodulin unlike native wild-type alpha-CaMKII. We show enhancement of this binding by Ca(2+)/calmodulin. Phosphorylation or a phosphorylation mimicking mutation on NR2B (NR2B-S1303D) abolishes the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-independent binding whereas it allows the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent binding of alpha-CaMKII in vitro. Similarly, the autonomously active mutants, T286D-alpha-CaMKII and F293E/N294D-alpha-CaMKII, exhibited Ca(2+)-independent binding to non-phosphorylatable mutant of NR2B under intracellular conditions. We also show for the first time that phosphatases in the brain such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylate phospho-Ser1303 on NR2B."

Neurochem.,2985190R,2009,The brain selenoproteome: priorities in the hierarchy and different levels of selenium homeostasis in the brain of selenium-deficient rats.,"The application of radionuclides for the localization of essential trace elements in vivo and the characterization of their binding proteins is a story of intermittently made improvements of the techniques used for their detection. In this study we present the use of neutron activation analysis and different autoradiographic imaging methods including real-time digital autoradiography to reveal new insights in the hierarchy of selenium homeostasis. Selenoproteins containing the essential trace element selenium play important roles in the CNS. Although the CNS does not show the highest selenium concentration in the case of selenium-sufficient supply in comparison with other organs, it shows a high priority for selenium uptake and retention in the case of dietary selenium deficiency. To characterize the hierarchy of selenium supply in the brain, in vivo radiotracer labeling with (75)Se in rats with different selenium status was combined with autoradiographic detection of (75)Se in brain tissue sections and (75)Se-labeled selenoproteins after protein separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This study demonstrates significant differences in the uptake of (75)Se into the brain of rats with different selenium status. A brain region-specific uptake pattern of the radiotracer (75)Se in selenium-deficient rats could be revealed and the CSF was identified as a key part of the brain selenium homeostasis."

This molecule has the disulfide-bridged beta-sheet core structure of natural beta-defensins and shows a robust salt-sensitive antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeast, as well as a chemotactic activity against immature dendritic cells. An SAR (structure-activity relationship) study using two truncated fragments or a Cys--&gt;Ser point-mutated analogue, from which one or two of the three disulfide bridges were absent, indicated that altering the structure resulted in a different type of membrane interaction and a switch to different modes of action towards both microbial and host cells, and that covalent dimerization could favour antimicrobial activity. Comparison of the structural, aggregational and biological activities of the artificial defensin with those of three human beta-defensins and their primate orthologues provided useful information on how their mode of action may relate to specific structural features."
19454700,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Local membrane mechanics of pore-spanning bilayers.,"The mechanical behavior of lipid bilayers spanning the pores of highly ordered porous silicon substrates was scrutinized by local indentation experiments as a function of surface functionalization, lipid composition, solvent content, indentation velocity, and pore radius. Solvent-containing nano black lipid membranes (nano-BLMs) as well as solvent-free pore-spanning bilayers were imaged by fluorescence and atomic force microscopy prior to force curve acquisition, which allows distinguishing between membrane-covered and uncovered pores. Force indentation curves on pore-spanning bilayers attached to functionalized hydrophobic porous silicon substrates reveal a predominately linear response that is mainly attributed to prestress in the membranes. This is in agreement with the observation that indentation leads to membrane lysis well below 5% area dilatation. However, membrane bending and lateral tension dominate over prestress and stretching if solvent-free supported membranes obtained from spreading giant liposomes on hydrophilic porous silicon are indented. An elastic regime diagram is presented that readily allows determining the dominant contribution to the mechanical response upon indentation as a function of load and pore radius."
19454705,0,J. Proteome Res.,101128775,2009,Orthogonal separation techniques for the characterization of the yeast nuclear proteome.,"The presence of the nucleus is the distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells, separating the genome from the cytoplasm. Key cellular events, including transcription, DNA replication, RNA-processing and ribosome biogenesis all take place in the nucleus. All of these processes can be regulated through controlled and bidirectional translocation of proteins across the nuclear envelope, making the nucleus a highly dynamic organelle. In this study, we present four orthogonal multidimensional separation techniques for the comprehensive characterization of the yeast nuclear proteome. By combining methods on the peptide level (SCX chromatography, isoelectric focusing) and protein level (SDS-PAGE, phosphocellulose chromatography) coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified 1889 proteins from highly purified nuclei, of which 1032 were previously annotated as nuclear proteins. In particular, the most successful setup was the use of phosphocellulose P11 chromatography in combination with SDS-PAGE and reversed phase chromatography. Phosphocellulose P11 chromatography has been classically used for the purification of functional protein complexes involved in transcription regulation. Here, by its coupling with LC-MS, this method resulted in approximately 1.5 times more protein identifications than the other three combined, thereby contributing significantly to the coverage of nuclear proteins. In addition, the use of this technique resulted in the enrichment of DNA binding proteins and proved to be a valuable tool for the simultaneous analysis of multiple protein complexes. The enrichment for specific nuclear complexes has resulted in high protein sequence coverage, which will be particularly useful for the detailed characterization of subunits."
19454711,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Adult hereditary fructose intolerance.,"Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an under-recognized, preventable life-threatening condition. It is an autosomal recessive disorder with subnormal activity of aldolase B in the liver, kidney and small bowel. Symptoms are present only after the ingestion of fructose, which leads to brisk hypoglycemia, and an individual with continued ingestion will exhibit vomiting, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, and renal and liver failure. A diagnosis of HFI was made in a 50-year-old woman on the basis of medical history, response to IV fructose intolerance test, demonstration of aldolase B activity reduction in duodenal biopsy, and molecular analysis of leukocyte DNA by PCR showed homozygosity for two doses of mutant gene. HFI may remain undiagnosed until adult life and may lead to disastrous complications following inadvertent fructose or sorbitol infusion. Several lethal episodes of HFI following sorbitol and fructose infusion have been reported. The diagnosis can only be suspected by taking a careful dietary history, and this can present serious complications."
19454723,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 and esophageal cancer risk in Southeast Chinese males.,"AIM: To evaluate the impact of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 (ADH2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) polymorphisms on esophageal cancer susceptibility in Southeast Chinese males. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one esophageal cancer patients and 191 healthy controls from Taixing city in Jiangsu Province were enrolled in this study. ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes were examined by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The ADH G allele carriers were more susceptible to esophageal cancer, but no association was found between ADH2 genotypes and risk of esophageal cancer when disregarding alcohol drinking status. Regardless of ADH2 genotype, ALDH2G/A or A/A carriers had significantly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer, with homozygous individuals showing higher esophageal cancer risk than those who were heterozygous. A significant interaction between ALDH2 and drinking was detected regarding esophageal cancer risk; the OR was 3.05 (95% CI: 1.49-6.25). Compared with non-drinkers carrying both ALDH2 G/G and ADH2 A/A, drinkers carrying both ALDH2 A allele and ADH2 G allele showed a significantly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer (OR = 8.36, 95% CI: 2.98-23.46). CONCLUSION: Both ADH2 G allele and ALDH2 A allele significantly increase the risk of esophageal cancer development in Southeast Chinese males. ALDH2 A allele significantly increases the risk of esophageal cancer development especially in alcohol drinkers. Alcohol drinkers carrying both ADH2 G allele and ALDH2 A allele have a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer."

METHODS: Bile samples obtained at ERC from 29 consecutive patients, 17 with and 12 without gallstone disease were evaluated for mucin content by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column. Dot blot analysis for bile mucin apoproteins was performed with antibodies to Mucin 1 (MUC1), MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6. Staining intensity score (0-3) was used as a measure of antigen expression. RESULTS: MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 were demonstrated in 34.4%, 34.4%, 51.7%, 51.7%, 55.1% and 27.5% of bile samples, respectively. The staining intensity scores were 0.62 +/- 0.94, 0.58 +/- 0.90, 0.79 +/- 0.97, 1.06 +/- 1.22, 1.20 +/- 1.26 and 0.41 +/- 0.73, respectively. Mean mucin concentration measured in bile by the Sepharose CL-4B method was 22.8 +/- 24.0 mg/mL (range 3.4-89.0 mg/mL). Mean protein concentration was 8.1 +/- 4.8 mg/mL (range 1.7-23.2 mg/mL). CONCLUSION: High levels of MUC3, MUC5AC and MUC5B are expressed in bile aspirated during ERC examination. A specific pattern of mucin gene expression or change in mucin concentration was not found in gallstone disease."

Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Efficacy of the revised Vienna Classification for diagnosing colorectal epithelial neoplasias.,"AIM: To prospectively investigate the efficacy of the revised Vienna Classification for diagnosing colorectal epithelial neoplastic lesions in cold biopsy specimens. METHODS: Patients were selected for inclusion if they had colorectal epithelial lesions that were not considered suitable for direct endoscopic resection. These included colorectal polyps &gt; or = 10 mm and lesions suspected of being carcinomas capable of invading the colorectal submucosa or beyond, including strictures, based on the cold biopsies obtained from each lesion prior to resection. We investigated the relationship between diagnoses based on cold biopsy samples using the revised Vienna Classification and resected specimens of the same lesions, and the therapeutic implications of diagnoses made using the revised Vienna Classification. The same cold biopsy specimens were also examined using the Japanese Group Classification guidelines, and compared with the resected specimens of the same lesions for reference. RESULTS: A total of 179 lesions were identified. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the revised Vienna Classification for distinguishing between intramucosal lesions and submucosal invasive carcinomas in cold biopsy specimens was 22.2%, 100%, 100%, and 71.4%, respectively, and for distinguishing between intramucosal lesions and those invading the submucosa or beyond was 59.7%, 100%, 100%, and 37.6%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the Japanese Group Classification for distinguishing between intramucosal lesions and submucosal invasive carcinomas in cold biopsy specimens was 83.3%, 91.4%, 83.3%, and 91.4%, respectively, and for distinguishing between intramucosal lesions and those invading the submucosa or beyond was 95.1%, 91.4%, 97.9%, and 82.1%, respectively. A total of 137 of 144 carcinomas that had invaded the submucosa or beyond and three high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias were diagnosed as &quot;carcinoma&quot; using the Japanese Group Classification system. CONCLUSION: The revised Vienna Classification for cold biopsy specimens has high positive predictive value in the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma invasive to the submucosa or beyond."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Hyaluronan molecular weight is controlled by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine concentration in Streptococcus zooepidemicus.,"The molecular weight of hyaluronan is important for its rheological and biological function. The molecular mechanisms underlying chain termination and hence molecular weight control remain poorly understood, not only for hyaluronan synthases but also for other beta-polysaccharide synthases, e.g. cellulose, chitin, and 1,3-betaglucan synthases. In this work, we manipulated metabolite concentrations in the hyaluronan pathway by overexpressing the five genes of the hyaluronan synthesis operon in Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis decreased molecular weight, whereas overexpression of genes involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis increased molecular weight. The highest molecular mass observed was at 3.4 +/- 0.1 MDa twice that observed in the wild-type strain, 1.8 +/- 0.1 MDa. The data indicate that (a) high molecular weight is achieved when an appropriate balance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid is achieved, (b) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine exerts the dominant effect on molecular weight, and (c) the wild-type strain has suboptimal levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Consistent herewith molecular weight correlated strongly (rho = 0.84, p = 3 x 10(-5)) with the concentration of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Data presented in this paper represent the first model for hyaluronan molecular weight control based on the concentration of activated sugar precursors. These results can be used to engineer strains producing high molecular weight hyaluronan and may provide insight into similar polymerization mechanisms in other polysaccharides."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by Epstein-Barr virus protein kinase induces its degradation through SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase actions during viral lytic replication.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) productive replication occurs in an S-phase-like cellular environment with high cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. The EBV protein kinase (PK), encoded by the viral BGLF4 gene, is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which phosphorylates both viral and cellular proteins, modifying the cellular environment for efficient viral productive replication. We here provide evidence that the EBV PK phosphorylates the CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1), resulting in ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner during EBV productive replication. Experiments with BGLF4 knockdown by small interfering RNA and BGLF4 knock-out viruses clarified that EBV PK is involved in p27(Kip1) degradation upon lytic replication. Transfection of the BGLF4 expression vector revealed that EBV PK alone could phosphorylate the Thr-187 residue of p27(Kip1) and that the ubiquitination and degradation of p27(Kip1) occurred in an SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner. In vitro, EBV PK proved capable of phosphorylating p27(Kip1) at Thr-187. Unlike cyclin E-CDK2 activity, the EBV PK activity was not inhibited by p27(Kip1). Overall, EBV PK enhances p27(Kip1) degradation effectively upon EBV productive replication, contributing to establishment of an S-phase-like cellular environment with high CDK activity."
19455405,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,"Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans.","As recognized already by Charles Darwin, animals are geobiological agents. Darwin observed that worms aerate and mix soils on a massive scale, aiding in the decomposition of soil organic matter. A similar statement can be made about marine benthic animals. This mixing, also known as bioturbation, not only aides in the decomposition of sedimentary organic material, but as contended here, it has also significantly influenced the chemistry of seawater. In particular, it is proposed that sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms resulted in a severalfold increase in seawater sulfate concentration. For this reason, the evolution of bioturbation is linked to the significant deposition of sulfate evaporate minerals, which is largely a phenomena of the Phanerozoic, the last 542 million years and the time over which animals rose to prominence."
19456126,0,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2009,The recycling and transcytotic pathways for IgG transport by FcRn are distinct and display an inherent polarity.,"The Fc receptor FcRn traffics immunoglobulin G (IgG) in both directions across polarized epithelial cells that line mucosal surfaces, contributing to host defense. We show that FcRn traffics IgG from either apical or basolateral membranes into the recycling endosome (RE), after which the actin motor myosin Vb and the GTPase Rab25 regulate a sorting step that specifies transcytosis without affecting recycling. Another regulatory component of the RE, Rab11a, is dispensable for transcytosis, but regulates recycling to the basolateral membrane only. None of these proteins affect FcRn trafficking away from lysosomes. Thus, FcRn transcytotic and recycling sorting steps are distinct. These results are consistent with a single structurally and functionally heterogeneous RE compartment that traffics FcRn to both cell surfaces while discriminating between recycling and transcytosis pathways polarized in their direction of transport."
19456143,0,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2009,RAD51C facilitates checkpoint signaling by promoting CHK2 phosphorylation.,"The RAD51 paralogues act in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway of DNA repair. Human RAD51C (hRAD51C) participates in branch migration and Holliday junction resolution and thus is important for processing HR intermediates late in the DNA repair process. Evidence for early involvement of RAD51 during DNA repair also exists, but its function in this context is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that RAD51C accumulates at DNA damage sites concomitantly with the RAD51 recombinase and is retained after RAD51 disassembly, which is consistent with both an early and a late function for RAD51C. RAD51C recruitment depends on ataxia telangiectasia mutated, NBS1, and replication protein A, indicating it functions after DNA end resection but before RAD51 assembly. Furthermore, we find that RAD51C is required for activation of the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. This suggests that hRAD51C contributes to the protection of genome integrity by transducing DNA damage signals in addition to engaging the HR machinery."
19456861,1,J. Exp. Med.,2985109R,2009,Unc93B1 biases Toll-like receptor responses to nucleic acid in dendritic cells toward DNA- but against RNA-sensing.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, and 9 recognize microbial nucleic acids in endolysosomes and initiate innate and adaptive immune responses. TLR7/9 in dendritic cells (DCs) also respond to self-derived RNA/DNA, respectively, and drive autoantibody production. Remarkably, TLR7 and 9 appear to have mutually opposing, pathogenic or protective, impacts on lupus nephritis in MRL/lpr mice. Little is known, however, about the contrasting relationship between TLR7 and 9. We show that TLR7 and 9 are inversely linked by Unc93B1, a multiple membrane-spanning endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. Complementation cloning with a TLR7-unresponsive but TLR9-responsive cell line revealed that amino acid D34 in Unc93B1 repressed TLR7-mediated responses. D34A mutation rendered Unc93B1-deficient DCs hyperresponsive to TLR7 ligand but hyporesponsive to TLR9 ligand, with TLR3 responses unaltered. Unc93B1 associates with and delivers TLR7/9 from the ER to endolysosomes for ligand recognition. The D34A mutation up-regulates Unc93B1 association with endogenous TLR7 in DCs, whereas Unc93B1 association with TLR9 was down-regulated by the D34A mutation. Consistently, the D34A mutation up-regulated ligand-induced trafficking of TLR7 but down-regulated that of TLR9. Collectively, TLR response to nucleic acids in DCs is biased toward DNA-sensing by Unc93B1."

Immun.,246127,2009,"An immunogenic, surface-exposed domain of Haemophilus ducreyi outer membrane protein HgbA is involved in hemoglobin binding.","HgbA is the sole TonB-dependent receptor for hemoglobin (Hb) acquisition of Haemophilus ducreyi. Binding of Hb to HgbA is the initial step in heme acquisition from Hb. To better understand this step, we mutagenized hgbA by deletion of each of the 11 putative surface-exposed loops and expressed each of the mutant proteins in trans in host strain H. ducreyi FX547 hgbA. All mutant proteins were expressed, exported, and detected on the surface by anti-HgbA immunoglobulin G (IgG). Deletion of sequences in loops 5 and 7 of HgbA abolished Hb binding in two different formats. In contrast, HgbA proteins containing deletions in the other nine loops retained the ability to bind Hb. None of the clones expressing mutant proteins were able to grow on plates containing low concentrations of Hb. Previously we demonstrated in a swine model of chancroid infection that an HgbA vaccine conferred complete protection from a challenge infection. Using anti-HgbA IgG from this study and the above deletion mutants, we show that loops 4, 5, and 7 of HgbA were immunogenic and surface exposed and that IgG directed against loops 4 and 5 blocked Hb binding. Furthermore, loop 6 was cleaved by protease on intact H. ducreyi, suggesting surface exposure. These data implicate a central domain of HgbA (in respect to the primary amino acid sequence) as important in Hb binding and suggest that this region of the molecule might have potential as a subunit vaccine."

Immun.,246127,2009,The capsule-encoding viaB locus reduces intestinal inflammation by a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1-independent mechanism.,"Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium elicits acute neutrophil influx in the human intestinal mucosa within 1 or 2 days after infection, resulting in inflammatory diarrhea. In contrast, no overt symptoms are observed within the first 1 or 2 weeks after infection with S. enterica serotype Typhi. Here we show that introduction of the capsule-encoding viaB locus of serotype Typhi reduced the ability of serotype Typhimurium to elicit acute intestinal inflammation in a streptomycin-pretreated mouse model. Serotype Typhimurium requires a functional invasion-associated type III secretion system (type III secretion system 1 [T3SS-1]) to elicit cecal inflammation within 48 h after infection of streptomycin-pretreated mice, and the presence of the viaB locus reduced its invasiveness for human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. However, a reduced activity of T3SS-1 could not account for the ability of the viaB locus to attenuate cecal inflammation, because introduction of the viaB locus into an invasion-deficient serotype Typhimurium strain (invA mutant) resulted in a significant reduction of pathology and inflammatory cytokine expression in the cecum 5 days after infection of mice. We conclude that a T3SS-1-independent mechanism contributes to the ability of the viaB locus to reduce intestinal inflammation."
19457079,0,Infect. Immun.,246127,2009,CovS simultaneously activates and inhibits the CovR-mediated repression of distinct subsets of group A Streptococcus virulence factor-encoding genes.,"To colonize and cause disease at distinct anatomical sites, bacterial pathogens must tailor gene expression in a microenvironment-specific manner. The molecular mechanisms that control the ability of the human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) to transition between infection sites have yet to be fully elucidated. A key regulator of GAS virulence gene expression is the CovR-CovS two-component regulatory system (also known as CsrR-CsrS). covR and covS mutant strains arise spontaneously during invasive infections and, in in vivo models of infection, rapidly become dominant. Here, we compared wild-type GAS with covR, covS, and covRS isogenic mutant strains to investigate the heterogeneity in the types of natural mutations that occur in covR and covS and the phenotypic consequences of covR or covS mutation. We found that the response regulator CovR retains some regulatory function in the absence of CovS and that CovS modulates CovR to significantly enhance repression of one group of genes (e.g., the speA, hasA, and ska genes) while it reduces repression of a second group of genes (e.g., the speB, grab, and spd3 genes). We also found that different in vivo-induced covR mutations can lead to strikingly different transcriptomes. While covS mutant strains show increased virulence in several invasive models of infection, we determined that these mutants are significantly outcompeted by wild-type GAS during growth in human saliva, an ex vivo model of upper respiratory tract infection. We propose that CovS-mediated regulation of CovR activity plays an important role in the ability of GAS to cycle between pharyngeal and invasive infections."
19457084,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,High-affinity transporters for NAD+ precursors in Candida glabrata are regulated by Hst1 and induced in response to niacin limitation.,"The yeast Candida glabrata is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. C. glabrata is a NAD(+) auxotroph, and its growth depends on the availability of niacin (environmental vitamin precursors of NAD(+)). We have previously shown that a virulence-associated adhesin, encoded by EPA6, is transcriptionally induced in response to niacin limitation. Here we used transcript profiling to characterize the transcriptional response to niacin limitation and the roles of the sirtuins Hst1, Hst2, and Sir2 in mediating this response. The majority of genes transcriptionally induced by niacin limitation are regulated by Hst1, suggesting that it is the primary sensor of niacin limitation in C. glabrata. We show that three highly induced genes, TNA1, TNR1, and TNR2, encode transporters which are necessary and sufficient for high-affinity uptake of NAD(+) precursors. Strikingly, if a tna1 tnr1 tnr2 mutant is starved for niacin, it exhibits an extended lag phase, suggesting a central role for the transporters in restoring NAD(+) homeostasis after niacin limitation. Lastly, we had previously shown that the adhesin encoded by EPA6 is induced during experimental urinary tract infection (UTI); we show here that EPA6 transcriptional induction during UTI is strongly enhanced in the tna1 tnr1 tnr2 mutant strain, implicating the transporters in the growth of C. glabrata during infection."

Biol.,8109087,2009,Expression of bacterial Rho factor in yeast identifies new factors involved in the functional interplay between transcription and mRNP biogenesis.,"In eukaryotic cells, the nascent pre-mRNA molecule is coated sequentially with a large set of processing and binding proteins that mediate its transformation into an export-competent ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) that is ready for translation in the cytoplasm. We have implemented an original assay that monitors the dynamic interplay between transcription and mRNP biogenesis and that allows the screening for new factors linking mRNA synthesis to translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay is based on the perturbation of gene expression induced by the bacterial Rho factor, an RNA-dependent helicase/translocase that acts as a competitor at one or several steps of mRNP biogenesis in yeast. We show that the expression of Rho in yeast leads to a dose-dependent growth defect that stems from its action on RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Rho expression induces the production of aberrant transcripts that are degraded by the nuclear exosome. A screen for dosage suppressors of the Rho-induced growth defect identified several genes that are involved in the different steps of mRNP biogenesis and export, as well as other genes with both known functions in transcription regulation and unknown functions. Our results provide evidence for an extensive cross talk between transcription, mRNP biogenesis, and export. They also uncover new factors that potentially are involved in these interconnected events."

Here ;we reconstitute in vitro a seven-protein reaction that recapitulates early steps of dsDNA break repair using purified RecA, RecF, RecO, RecR, RecQ, RecJ, and SSB proteins, components of the RecF system. Their combined action results in processing of linear dsDNA and its homologous pairing with supercoiled DNA. RecA, RecO, RecR, and RecJ are essential for joint molecule formation, whereas SSB and RecF are stimulatory. This reconstituted system reveals an unexpected essential function for RecJ exonuclease: the capability to resect duplex DNA. RecQ helicase stimulates this processing, but also disrupts joint molecules. RecO and RecR have two indispensable functions: They mediate exchange of RecA for SSB to form the RecA nucleoprotein filament, and act with RecF to load RecA onto the SSB-ssDNA complex at processed ssDNA-dsDNA junctions. The RecF pathway has many parallels with recombinational repair in eukaryotes."

Hydrogen exchange rates of the imino protons were measured for various CPD-containing DNA duplexes to better understand the mechanism for CPD recognition by XPC-hHR23B. The results here revealed that double T.G mismatches in a CPD lesion significantly destabilized six consecutive base pairs compared to other DNA duplexes. This flexibility in a DNA duplex caused at the CPD lesions with double T.G mismatches might be the key factor for damage recognition by XPC-hHR23B.

FEBS Lett. 540, 251-254] and proposed that the evolutionary origin of beetle luciferase is a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) in insect. In this study, we performed the functional conversion of FACS to luciferase by replacing a single amino acid to serine. This serine residue is conserved in luciferases and possibly interacts with luciferin. The mutants of FACSs in non-luminous click beetle Agrypnus binodulus (AbLL) and Drosophila melanogaster (CG6178) gave luminescence enhancement, suggesting that the serine residue is a key substitution responsible for luminescence activity."

Peptides corresponding to loops alpha8, 1 and 3, but not loop 2, competed with toxin binding to Aedes midgut membranes. Mutagenesis data reveal loops alpha8, 1 and 3 are involved in toxicity. Loops 1 and 3 are of greater significance in toxicity to Aedes and Culex larvae than to Anopheles. Cry11Ba binds the apical membrane of larval caecae and posterior midgut, and binding can be competed by loop 1 but not by loop 2 peptides. Cry11Ba binds the same regions to which anti-cadherin antibody binds, and this antibody competes with Cry11Ba binding suggesting a possible role of cadherin in toxication."

In this study, we performed bioactivity-guided screening of the Lonicera hypoglauca Miq. crude extracts to find for naturally chemical entities with anti-HCV activity. Pheophytin a was identified from the ethanol-soluble fraction of L. hypoglauca that elicited dose-dependent inhibition of HCV viral proteins and RNA expression in both replicon cells and cell culture infectious system. Computational modeling revealed that pheophytin a can bind to the active site of HCV-NS3, suggesting that NS3 is a potent molecular target of pheophytin a. Biochemical analysis further revealed that pheophytin a inhibited NS3 serine protease activity with IC(50)=0.89 microM. Notably, pheophytin a and IFNalpha-2a elicited synergistic anti-HCV activity in replicon cells with no significant cytotoxicity. This study thereby demonstrates for the first time that pheophytin a is a potent HCV-NS3 protease inhibitor and offers insight for development of novel anti-HCV regimens."

This study reports for the first time that TOFA (5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid), an allosteric inhibitor of ACCA, is cytotoxic to lung cancer cells NCI-H460 and colon carcinoma cells HCT-8 and HCT-15, with an IC(50) at approximately 5.0, 5.0, and 4.5 microg/ml, respectively. TOFA at 1.0-20.0 microg/ml effectively blocked fatty acid synthesis and induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The cell death was characterized with PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and annexin-V staining, all of which are the features of the apoptosis. Supplementing simultaneously the cells with palmitic acids (100 microM), the end-products of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, prevented the apoptosis induced by TOFA. Taken together, these data suggest that TOFA is a potent cytotoxic agent to lung and colon cancer cells, inducing apoptosis through disturbing their fatty acid synthesis."
19457998,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,The clathrin assembly protein AP180 regulates the generation of amyloid-beta peptide.,"The overproduction and extracellular buildup of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is a critical step in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Recent data suggest that intracellular trafficking is of central importance in the production of Abeta. Here we use a neuronal cell line to examine two structurally similar clathrin assembly proteins, AP180 and CALM. We show that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of AP180 reduces the generation of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, whereas CALM knockdown has no effect on Abeta generation. Thus AP180 is among the traffic controllers that oversee and regulate amyloid precursor protein processing pathways. Our results also suggest that AP180 and CALM, while similar in their domain structures and biochemical properties, are in fact dedicated to separate trafficking pathways in neurons."

Here we present the structures of both Escherichia coli YidC and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Oxa1 bound to E. coli ribosome nascent chain complexes determined by cryo-electron microscopy. Dimers of YidC and Oxa1 are localized above the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. Crosslinking experiments show that the ribosome specifically stabilizes the dimeric state. Functionally important and conserved transmembrane helices of YidC and Oxa1 were localized at the dimer interface by cysteine crosslinking. Both Oxa1 and YidC dimers contact the ribosome at ribosomal protein L23 and conserved rRNA helices 59 and 24, similarly to what was observed for the nonhomologous SecYEG translocon. We suggest that dimers of the YidC and Oxa1 proteins form insertion pores and share a common overall architecture with the SecY monomer."

However, the proteasome is limited in its capacity to degrade oligomeric and aggregated proteins. Removal of harmful protein aggregates is mediated by autophagy, a mechanism by which the cell sequesters cytosolic cargo and delivers it for degradation by the lysosome. Identification of autophagy receptors, such as p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which simultaneously bind both ubiquitin and autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like modifiers, LC3/GABARAP, has provided a molecular link between ubiquitination and autophagy. This review explores the hypothesis that ubiquitin represents a selective degradation signal suitable for targeting various types of cargo, ranging from protein aggregates to membrane-bound organelles and microbes."
19458007,0,Cell,413066,2009,The mechanism of ATP-dependent primer-template recognition by a clamp loader complex.,"Clamp loaders load sliding clamps onto primer-template DNA. The structure of the E. coli clamp loader bound to DNA reveals the formation of an ATP-dependent spiral of ATPase domains that tracks only the template strand, allowing recognition of both RNA and DNA primers. Unlike hexameric helicases, in which DNA translocation requires distinct conformations of the ATPase domains, the clamp loader spiral is symmetric and is set up to trigger release upon DNA recognition. Specificity for primed DNA arises from blockage of the end of the primer and accommodation of the emerging template along a surface groove. A related structure reveals how the psi protein, essential for coupling the clamp loader to single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), binds to the clamp loader. By stabilizing a conformation of the clamp loader that is consistent with the ATPase spiral observed upon DNA binding, psi binding promotes the clamp-loading activity of the complex."

J.,370626,2009,Growth pattern of single fission yeast cells is bilinear and depends on temperature and DNA synthesis.,"Cell growth and division have to be tightly coordinated to keep the cell size constant over generations. Changes in cell size can be easily studied in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because these cells have a cylindrical shape and grow only at the cell ends. However, the growth pattern of single cells is currently unclear. Linear, exponential, and bilinear growth models have been proposed. Here we measured the length of single fission yeast cells with high spatial precision and temporal resolution over the whole cell cycle by using time-lapse confocal microscopy of cells with green fluorescent protein-labeled plasma membrane. We show that the growth profile between cell separation and the subsequent mitosis is bilinear, consisting of two linear segments separated by a rate-change point (RCP). The change in growth rate occurred at the same relative time during the cell cycle and at the same relative extension for different temperatures. The growth rate before the RCP was independent of temperature, whereas the growth rate after the RCP increased with an increase in temperature, leading to clear bilinear growth profiles at higher temperatures. The RCP was not directly related to the initiation of growth at the new end (new end take-off). When DNA synthesis was inhibited by hydroxyurea, the RCP was not detected. This result suggests that completion of DNA synthesis is required for the increase in growth rate. We conclude that the growth of fission yeast cells is not a simple exponential growth, but a complex process with precise rates regulated by the events during the cell cycle."
19458086,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Filamin A is essential for active cell stiffening but not passive stiffening under external force.,"The material properties of a cell determine how mechanical forces are transmitted through and sensed by that cell. Some types of cells stiffen passively under large external forces, but they can also alter their own stiffness in response to the local mechanical environment or biochemical cues. Here we show that the actin-binding protein filamin A is essential for the active stiffening of cells plated on collagen-coated substrates. This appears to be due to a diminished capability to build up large internal contractile stresses in the absence of filamin A. To show this, we compare the material properties and contractility of two human melanoma cell lines that differ in filamin A expression. The filamin A-deficient M2 cells are softer than the filamin A-replete A7 cells, and exert much smaller contractile stresses on the substratum, even though the M2 cells have similar levels of phosphorylated myosin II light chain and only somewhat diminished adhesion strength. In contrast to A7 cells, the stiffness and contractility of M2 cells are insensitive to either myosin-inhibiting drugs or the stiffness of the substratum. Surprisingly, however, filamin A is not required for passive stiffening under large external forces."
19458090,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Traction stresses and translational distortion of the nucleus during fibroblast migration on a physiologically relevant ECM mimic.,"Cellular traction forces, resulting in cell-substrate physical interactions, are generated by actin-myosin complexes and transmitted to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions. These processes are highly dynamic under physiological conditions and modulate cell migration. To better understand the precise dynamics of cell migration, we measured the spatiotemporal redistribution of cellular traction stresses (force per area) during fibroblast migration at a submicron level and correlated it with nuclear translocation, an indicator of cell migration, on a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix mimic. We found that nuclear translocation occurred in pulses whose magnitude was larger on the low ligand density surfaces than on the high ligand density surfaces. Large nuclear translocations only occurred on low ligand density surfaces when the rear traction stresses completely relocated to a posterior nuclear location, whereas such relocation took much longer time on high ligand density surfaces, probably due to the greater magnitude of traction stresses. Nuclear distortion was also observed as the traction stresses redistributed. Our results suggest that the reinforcement of the traction stresses around the nucleus as well as the relaxation of nuclear deformation are critical steps during fibroblast migration, serving as a speed regulator, which must be considered in any dynamic molecular reconstruction model of tissue cell migration. A traction gradient foreshortening model was proposed to explain how the relocation of rear traction stresses leads to pulsed fibroblast migration."

J.,370626,2009,Penetration depth of surfactant peptide KL4 into membranes is determined by fatty acid saturation.,"KL(4) is a 21-residue functional peptide mimic of lung surfactant protein B, an essential protein for lowering surface tension in the alveoli. Its ability to modify lipid properties and restore lung compliance was investigated with circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. KL(4) binds fluid lamellar phase PC/PG lipid membranes and forms an amphipathic helix that alters lipid organization and acyl chain dynamics. The binding and helicity of KL(4) is dependent on the level of monounsaturation in the fatty acid chains. At physiologic temperatures, KL(4) is more peripheral and dynamic in fluid phase POPC/POPG MLVs but is deeply inserted into fluid phase DPPC/POPG vesicles, resulting in immobilization of the peptide. Substantial increases in the acyl chain order are observed in DPPC/POPG lipid vesicles with increasing levels of KL(4), and POPC/POPG lipid vesicles show small decreases in the acyl chain order parameters on addition of KL(4). Additionally, a clear effect of KL(4) on the orientation of the fluid phase PG headgroups is observed, with similar changes in both lipid environments. Near the phase transition temperature of the DPPC/POPG lipid mixtures, which is just below the physiologic temperature of lung surfactant, KL(4) causes phase separation with the DPPC remaining in a gel phase and the POPG partitioned between gel and fluid phases. The ability of KL(4) to differentially partition into lipid lamellae containing varying levels of monounsaturation and subsequent changes in curvature strain suggest a mechanism for peptide-mediated lipid organization and trafficking within the dynamic lung environment."
19458116,1,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,A kinetic model of the inositol trisphosphate receptor based on single-channel data.,"In many cell types, the inositol trisphosphate receptor is one of the important components controlling intracellular calcium dynamics, and an understanding of this receptor is necessary for an understanding of calcium oscillations and waves. Based on single-channel data from the type-I inositol trisphosphate receptor, and using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we show that the most complex time-dependent model that can be unambiguously determined from steady-state data is one with three closed states and one open state, and we determine how the rate constants depend on calcium. Because the transitions between these states are complex functions of calcium concentration, each model state must correspond to a group of physical states. We fit two different topologies and find that both models predict that the main effect of [Ca(2+)] is to modulate the probability that the receptor is in a state that is able to open, rather than to modulate the transition rate to the open state."

J.,370626,2009,Importance of the peptide backbone description in modeling the selectivity filter in potassium channels.,"A dihedral energy correction (CMAP) term has been recently included in the CHARMM force field to obtain a more accurate description of the peptide backbone. Its importance in improving dynamical properties of proteins and preserving their stability in long molecular-dynamics simulations has been established for several globular proteins. Here we investigate its role in maintaining the structure and function of two potassium channels, Shaker K(v)1.2 and KcsA, by performing molecular-dynamics simulations with and without the CMAP correction in otherwise identical systems. We show that without CMAP, it is not possible to maintain the experimentally observed orientations of the carbonyl groups in the selectivity filter in Shaker, and the channel loses its selectivity property. In the case of KcsA, the channel retains some selectivity even without CMAP because the carbonyl orientations are relatively better preserved compared to Shaker."

J.,370626,2009,Effect of voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins on neuronal excitability.,"Fluorescent protein voltage sensors are recombinant proteins that are designed as genetically encoded cellular probes of membrane potential using mechanisms of voltage-dependent modulation of fluorescence. Several such proteins, including VSFP2.3 and VSFP3.1, were recently reported with reliable function in mammalian cells. They were designed as molecular fusions of the voltage sensor of Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor containing phosphatase with a fluorescence reporter domain. Expression of these proteins in cell membranes is accompanied by additional dynamic membrane capacitance, or &quot;sensing capacitance&quot;, with feedback effect on the native electro-responsiveness of targeted cells. We used recordings of sensing currents and fluorescence responses of VSFP2.3 and of VSFP3.1 to derive kinetic models of the voltage-dependent signaling of these proteins. Using computational neuron simulations, we quantitatively investigated the perturbing effects of sensing capacitance on the input/output relationship in two central neuron models, a cerebellar Purkinje and a layer 5 pyramidal neuron. Probe-induced sensing capacitance manifested as time shifts of action potentials and increased synaptic input thresholds for somatic action potential initiation with linear dependence on the membrane density of the probe. Whereas the fluorescence signal/noise grows with the square root of the surface density of the probe, the growth of sensing capacitance is linear. We analyzed the trade-off between minimization of sensing capacitance and signal/noise of the optical read-out depending on kinetic properties and cellular distribution of the probe. The simulation results suggest ways to reduce capacitive effects at a given level of signal/noise. Yet, the simulations indicate that significant improvement of existing probes will still be required to report action potentials in individual neurons in mammalian brain tissue in single trials."

We report a combined electrochemical and theoretical study demonstrating that the pentameric PLN does not possess channel activity for conducting chloride or calcium ions across the lipid membrane. This suggests that the pentameric configuration of PLN primarily serves as a storage form for the regulatory function of muscle relaxation by the PLN monomer."

J.,101231645,2009,Transduction of rat pancreatic islets with pseudotyped adeno-associated virus vectors.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic islet transplantation is a promising treatment for type I diabetes mellitus, but current immunosuppressive strategies do not consistently provide long-term survival of transplanted islets. We are therefore investigating the use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as gene therapy vectors to transduce rat islets with immunosuppressive genes prior to transplantation into diabetic mice. RESULTS: We compared the transduction efficiency of AAV2 vectors with an AAV2 capsid (AAV2/2) to AAV2 vectors pseudotyped with AAV5 (AAV2/5), AAV8 (AAV2/8) or bovine adeno-associated virus (BAAV) capsids, or an AAV2 capsid with an insertion of the low density lipoprotein receptor ligand from apolipoprotein E (AAV2apoE), on cultured islets, in the presence of helper adenovirus infection to speed expression of a GFP transgene. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used. The AAV2/5 vector was superior to AAV2/2 and AAV2/8 in rat islets. Flow cytometry indicated AAV2/5-mediated gene expression in approximately 9% of rat islet cells and almost 12% of insulin-positive cells. The AAV2/8 vector had a higher dependence on the helper virus multiplicity of infection than the AAV 2/5 vector. In addition, the BAAV and AAV2apoE vectors were superior to AAV2/2 for transducing rat islets. Rat islets (300 per mouse) transduced with an AAV2/5 vector harboring the immunosuppressive transgene, tgf beta 1, retain the ability to correct hyperglycemia when transplanted into immune-deficient diabetic mice. CONCLUSION: AAV2/5 vectors may therefore be useful for pre-treating donor islets prior to transplantation."
19458250,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,A rate-limiting conformational step in the catalytic pathway of the glmS ribozyme.,"The glmS ribozyme is a conserved riboswitch in numerous Gram-positive bacteria and is located upstream of the glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) synthetase reading frame. Binding of GlcN6P activates site-specific self-cleavage of the glmS mRNA, resulting in the downregulation of glmS gene expression. Unlike other riboswitches, the glmS ribozyme does not undergo structural rearrangement upon metabolite binding, indicating that the metabolite binding pocket is preformed in the absence of ligand. This observation led us to test if individual steps in the reaction pathway could be dissected by initiating the cleavage reaction before or after Mg(2+)-dependent folding. Here we show that self-cleavage reactions initiated with simultaneous addition of Mg(2+) and GlcN6P are slow (3 min(-1)) compared to reactions initiated by addition of GlcN6P to glmS RNA that has been prefolded in Mg(2+)-containing buffer (72 min(-1)). These data indicate that some level of Mg(2+)-dependent folding is rate-limiting for catalysis. Reactions initiated by addition of GlcN6P to the prefolded ribozyme also resulted in a 30-fold increase in the apparent ligand K(d) compared to those of reactions initiated by a global folding step. Time-resolved hydroxyl-radical footprinting was employed to determine if global tertiary structure formation is the rate-limiting step. The results of these experiments provided evidence for fast and largely concerted folding of the global tertiary structure (&gt;13 min(-1)). This indicates that the rate-limiting step that we have identified either is a slow folding step between the fast initial folding and ligand binding events or represents the rate of escape from a nativelike folding trap."
19458257,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Cellular membrane disruption by amyloid fibrils involved intermolecular disulfide cross-linking.,"Accumulating evidence has strongly suggested that amyloid fibrils of protein or peptide are cytotoxic. Fibrillar species appear to lead to disruption of cell membrane structures and thereby cause cell death. In this study, human erythrocytes were used as an in vitro model to examine the disruptive effect of lysozyme fibrils on the plasma membrane. Both the protofibrils and mature fibrils induced hemolysis and aggregation of erythrocytes. Treating ghost membranes with the fibrils resulted in aggregation of membrane proteins through intermolecular disulfide cross-linking. LC-ESI-MS/MS and Western blotting analysis showed that lysozyme fragments were incorporated into the aggregates of ghost membrane proteins, which suggested that thio-disulfide exchange among lysozyme and membrane proteins was triggered when the fibrils interacted with erythrocyte membranes. Metal-ion chelators, radical scavengers, and antioxidants had no effect on the amyloid-induced disulfide cross-linking. The exposure of interior hydrophobic residues and the increased level of solvent-accessible disulfides in the lysozyme fibrils are thought to be involved in membrane disruption. These results may unveil a novel pathway for the cytotoxicity of amyloid fibrils."

The bromide salts [R(3)P x PR'(2)=NSiMe(3)]Br [R' = Me ([6](+)), OCH(2)CF(3) ([8](+)); R(3)P = Me(3)P (a), Et(3)P (b), (n)Bu(3)P (c), dmpm (d, dmpm = dimethylphosphinomethane), dmpe (e, dmpe = dimethylphosphinoethane)] were prepared from the direct reactions between BrMe(2)P=NSiMe(3) (5) and Br(CF(3)CH(2)O)(2)P=NSiMe(3) (7) and the corresponding tertiary phosphines R(3)P or the diphosphines Me(2)P(CH(2))(n)PMe(2) (n = 1, 2). Cations of the type [6](+) and [8](+), with electron-donating and -withdrawing groups at the phosphoranimine phosphorus center, respectively, undergo facile phosphine ligand substitution with the strong N-donor 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to yield the corresponding DMAP-stabilized salts [DMAP x PR(2)=NSiMe(3)]Br [R = Me ([9](+)), OCH(2)CF(3) ([10](+))]. Cations [6](+) with Br(-) anions are particularly labile: for example, [6a]Br slowly releases PMe(3), BrSiMe(3), and forms cyclic phosphazenes such as [Me(2)P=N](4). Anion exchange reactions between the salts [6b]Br or [8c]Br and AgOTf (OTf = CF(3)SO(3)) quantitatively afforded the corresponding and more stable triflate salts [6b]OTf and [8c]OTf. Phosphine ligand abstraction reactions with B(C(6)F(5))(3) were observed for the bromide salts [6b]Br and [8c]Br, which regenerated the phosphoranimines 5 and 7, respectively, and formed the adduct R(3)P x B(C(6)F(5))(3). In contrast, the triflate salts [6b]OTf and [8c]OTf were unreactive under the same conditions. X-ray structural analysis of the P-donor stabilized cations revealed longer P-P and P-N bond lengths and smaller P-N-Si bond angles for cations [6](+) compared to analogs [8](+). These structural differences were rationalized using the negative hyperconjugation bonding model. In addition, the (1)J(PP) coupling constants for the cations [6](+) observed by both solution and solid-state (31)P NMR are remarkably small (13-25 Hz), whereas those for [8](+) are substantially larger and positive (276-324 Hz) and are as expected for P(IV)(+)-P(V) systems. DFT studies suggest that the significant difference in (1)J(PP) couplings observed for [6](+) and [8](+) appears to be related to the electronegativity of the R' substituents at the phosphoranimine phosphorus center rather than the strength of the donor-acceptor P-P bond, which is slightly weaker in [6](+) relative to that in [8](+), as indicated by the X-ray data and reactivity studies."

Current treatment regimens are, to a certain degree, inadequate, with a 5-year mortality rate of around 50% and novel therapeutic targets are urgently required. Using expression microarrays, we identified the eps8 gene as being overexpressed in OSCC cell lines relative to normal oral keratinocytes, and confirmed these findings using RT-PCR and western blotting. In human tissues, we found that Eps8 was upregulated in OSCC (32% of primary tumors) compared with normal oral mucosa, and that expression correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis (P=0.032), suggesting a disease-promoting effect. Using OSCC cell lines, we assessed the functional role of Eps8 in tumor cells. Although suppression of Eps8 produced no effect on cell proliferation, both cell spreading and migration were markedly inhibited. The latter cell functions may be modulated through the small GTP-ase, Rac1 and we used pull-down assays to investigate the role of Eps8 in Rac1 signaling. We found that alphavbeta6- and alpha5beta1-integrin-dependent activation of Rac1 was mediated through Eps8. Knockdown of either Eps8 or Rac1, inhibited integrin-dependent cell migration similarly and transient expression of constitutively active Rac1 restored migration of cells in which Eps8 expression had been suppressed. We also showed that knockdown of Eps8 inhibited tumor cell invasion in an organotypic model of OSCC. These data suggest that Eps8 and Rac1 are part of an integrated signaling pathway modulating integrin-dependent tumour cell motility and identify Eps8 as a possible therapeutic target."

Disruption of sulfhydryl homeostasis, which resulted in ER stress, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and subsequent ER dilation, contributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-independent cell death by 15d-PGJ2. Absence of intracellular organelles in these vacuoles, shown by electron microscopy and unique fragmentation of lamin B, suggested this form of cell death to be different from autophagy and apoptosis. Cell death induced by 15d-PGJ2 is prevented by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, suggesting a requirement of new protein synthesis for death with cytoplasmic vacuolation. Here, we report for the first time that upregulation and processing of autophagy marker LC3 is an important event in nonautophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death. Notably, knockdown of LC3 conferred significant protection against 15d-PGJ2-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death, suggesting a novel role of LC3 in a death process other than autophagy."

Although it is well known how bone resorption is stimulated, the molecular mechanisms that mediate impaired bone formation are poorly understood. Here we show that the time- and stage-specific inhibition of endogenous inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK)--nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in differentiated osteoblasts substantially increases trabecular bone mass and bone mineral density without affecting osteoclast activities in young mice. Moreover, inhibition of IKK-NF-kappaB in differentiated osteoblasts maintains bone formation, thereby preventing osteoporotic bone loss induced by ovariectomy in adult mice. Inhibition of IKK-NF-kappaB enhances the expression of Fos-related antigen-1 (Fra-1), an essential transcription factor involved in bone matrix formation in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting IKK-NF-kappaB may help to promote bone formation in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases."

Cell Biol.,100890575,2009,p53 controls cancer cell invasion by inducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of Slug.,"The tumour suppressor p53 is known to prevent cancer progression by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Slug, an invasion promoter, exerts its effects by repressing E-cadherin transcription. Here we show that wild-type p53 (wtp53) suppresses cancer invasion by inducing Slug degradation, whereas mutant p53 may stabilize Slug protein. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutation of p53 correlates with low MDM2, high Slug and low E-cadherin expression. This expression profile is associated with poor overall survival and short metastasis-free survival in patients with NSCLC. wtp53 upregulates MDM2 and forms a wtp53-MDM2-Slug complex that facilitates MDM2-mediated Slug degradation. Downregulation of Slug by wtp53 or MDM2 enhances E-cadherin expression and represses cancer cell invasiveness. In contrast, mutant p53 inactivates Slug degradation and leads to Slug accumulation and increased cancer cell invasiveness. Our findings indicate that wtp53 and p53 mutants may differentially control cancer invasion and metastasis through the p53-MDM2-Slug pathway."

Here we show that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) promotes the expression of CLIC4 and Schnurri-2 as well as their association in the cytoplasm and their translocation to the nucleus. In the absence of CLIC4 or Schnurri-2, TGF-beta signalling is abrogated. Direct nuclear targeting of CLIC4 enhances TGF-beta signalling and removes the requirement for Schnurri-2. Nuclear CLIC4 associates with phospho (p)-Smad2 and p-Smad3, protecting them from dephosphorylation by nuclear phosphatases. An intact TGF-beta signalling pathway is essential for CLIC4-mediated growth-arrest. These results newly identify Schnurri-2 and CLIC4 as modifiers of TGF-beta signalling through their stabilization of p-Smad2 and 3 in the nucleus."

In vivo protein labeling showed that synthesis rates of the PSII reaction center protein D1/D2 were lower, and turnover rates of PSII core proteins higher, than in wild-type counterparts. The assembly of newly synthesized proteins into PSII occurs in the lpa66 mutant but with reduced efficiency compared with the wild type. LPA66 encodes a chloroplast protein of the pentatricopeptide repeat family. In lpa66 mutants, editing of psbF that converts serine to phenylalanine is specifically impaired. Thus, LPA66 is specifically required for editing the psbF transcripts in Arabidopsis, and the amino acid alternation due to lack of editing strongly affects the efficiency of the assembly of PSII complexes."
19459633,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,TriFLDB: a database of clustered full-length coding sequences from Triticeae with applications to comparative grass genomics.,"The Triticeae Full-Length CDS Database (TriFLDB) contains available information regarding full-length coding sequences (CDSs) of the Triticeae crops wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) and includes functional annotations and comparative genomics features. TriFLDB provides a search interface using keywords for gene function and related Gene Ontology terms and a similarity search for DNA and deduced translated amino acid sequences to access annotations of Triticeae full-length CDS (TriFLCDS) entries. Annotations consist of similarity search results against several sequence databases and domain structure predictions by InterProScan. The deduced amino acid sequences in TriFLDB are grouped with the proteome datasets for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) by hierarchical clustering in stepwise thresholds of sequence identity, providing hierarchical clustering results based on full-length protein sequences. The database also provides sequence similarity results based on comparative mapping of TriFLCDSs onto the rice and sorghum genome sequences, which together with current annotations can be used to predict gene structures for TriFLCDS entries. To provide the possible genetic locations of full-length CDSs, TriFLCDS entries are also assigned to the genetically mapped cDNA sequences of barley and diploid wheat, which are currently accommodated in the Triticeae Mapped EST Database. These relational data are searchable from the search interfaces of both databases. The current TriFLDB contains 15,871 full-length CDSs from barley and wheat and includes putative full-length cDNAs for barley and wheat, which are publicly accessible. This informative content provides an informatics gateway for Triticeae genomics and grass comparative genomics. TriFLDB is publicly available at http://TriFLDB.psc.riken.jp/."
19459652,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Phosphorylation of SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 by SOS2 protein kinase stabilizes their protein complex and regulates salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.,"The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway plays an important role in the regulation of Na+/K+ ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previously, we reported that the calcium binding proteins SOS3 and SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8) nonredundantly activate the protein kinase SOS2. Here, we show that SOS2 phosphorylates SCaBP8 at its C terminus but does not phosphorylate SOS3. In vitro, SOS2 phosphorylation of SCaBP8 was enhanced by the bimolecular interaction of SOS2 and SCaBP8 and did not require calcium ions. In vivo, this phosphorylation was induced by salt stress, occurred at the membrane, stabilized the SCaBP8-SOS2 interaction, and enhanced plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity. When a Ser at position 237 in the SCaBP8 protein (the SOS2 phosphorylation target) was mutated to Ala, SCaBP8 was no longer phosphorylated by SOS2 and the mutant protein could not fully rescue the salt-sensitive phenotype of the scabp8 mutant. By contrast, when Ser-237 was mutated to Asp to mimic the charge of a phosphorylated Ser residue, the mutant protein rescued the scabp8 salt sensitivity. These data demonstrate that calcium sensor phosphorylation is a critical component of SOS pathway regulation of salt tolerance in Arabidopsis."
19460148,0,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,Combinatorial algorithms for structural variation detection in high-throughput sequenced genomes.,"Recent studies show that along with single nucleotide polymorphisms and small indels, larger structural variants among human individuals are common. The Human Genome Structural Variation Project aims to identify and classify deletions, insertions, and inversions (&gt;5 Kbp) in a small number of normal individuals with a fosmid-based paired-end sequencing approach using traditional sequencing technologies. The realization of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing platforms now makes it feasible to detect the full spectrum of genomic variation among many individual genomes, including cancer patients and others suffering from diseases of genomic origin. Unfortunately, existing algorithms for identifying structural variation (SV) among individuals have not been designed to handle the short read lengths and the errors implied by the &quot;next-gen&quot; sequencing (NGS) technologies. In this paper, we give combinatorial formulations for the SV detection between a reference genome sequence and a next-gen-based, paired-end, whole genome shotgun-sequenced individual. We describe efficient algorithms for each of the formulations we give, which all turn out to be fast and quite reliable; they are also applicable to all next-gen sequencing methods (Illumina, 454 Life Sciences [Roche], ABI SOLiD, etc.) and traditional capillary sequencing technology. We apply our algorithms to identify SV among individual genomes very recently sequenced by Illumina technology."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Reprogramming of murine fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells with chemical complementation of Klf4.,"Ectopic expression of defined transcription factors can reprogram somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, but the utility of iPS cells is hampered by the use of viral delivery systems. Small molecules offer an alternative to replace virally transduced transcription factors with chemical signaling cues responsible for reprogramming. In this report we describe a small-molecule screening platform applied to identify compounds that functionally replace the reprogramming factor Klf4. A series of small-molecule scaffolds were identified that activate Nanog expression in mouse fibroblasts transduced with a subset of reprogramming factors lacking Klf4. Application of one such molecule, kenpaullone, in lieu of Klf4 gave rise to iPS cells that are indistinguishable from murine embryonic stem cells. This experimental platform can be used to screen large chemical libraries in search of novel compounds to replace the reprogramming factors that induce pluripotency. Ultimately, such compounds may provide mechanistic insight into the reprogramming process."
19460338,0,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2009,Concomitant use of Ad5/35 chimeric oncolytic adenovirus with TRAIL gene and taxol produces synergistic cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells.,"Chimeric adenoviral vectors possessing fiber derived from human adenovirus subgroup B (Ad35) have been developed for their high infection efficiency in cell types which are refractory to adenovirus serotype 5 (Subgroup C). The present study constructed an E1B-deleted chimeric oncolytic adenovirus, SG235-TRAIL, which carries a human TRAIL gene expression cassette and whose fiber shaft and knob domains are from serotype Ad35. It was found that SG235-TRAIL preferentially replicated in gastric cancer cell lines, SGC-7901 and BGC-823 compared to in normal human fibroblast BJ cells. Also, when compared with a replication-deficient chimeric vector Ad5/35-TRAIL, SG235-TRAIL mediated a higher level of the transgene expression via viral replication in the cancer cells. Further, because of the more efficient cell-entry and infection, SG235-TRAIL induced stronger cell apoptosis than the Ad5 CRAD vector, ZD55-TRAIL. In addition, SG235-TRAIL in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, taxol, produced a synergistic cytotoxic effect in cancer cells in vitro without causing significant toxicity to normal cells. In the gastric tumor xenograft mouse model, intratumoral SG235-TRAIL injection produced a significant antitumor effect 14 days after treatment. Pathological examination demonstrated TRAIL expression and associated apoptosis in majority of SG235-TRAIL-treated tumor cells. These results suggest that SG235-TRAIL is a potential novel, efficient anti-cancer agent, and in combination with taxol, it would be even more useful with considerably low toxic side effects."
19460341,0,Virology,110674,2009,TLR5 stimulation is sufficient to trigger reactivation of latent HIV-1 provirus in T lymphoid cells and activate virus gene expression in central memory CD4+ T cells.,"When effector CD4+ T cells carrying integrated HIV-1 proviruses revert back to a resting memory state, the virus can remain silent in those cells for years. Following re-exposure to the nominal antigen or in response to other stimuli (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines), these cells can begin to produce virus. Here we demonstrate that TLR5 stimulation induces activation of NF-kappaB and reactivate latent HIV-1 in CD4+ T lymphoid cells. Interestingly, we report also that TLR5 engagement leads to virus gene expression in quiescent central memory CD4+ T cells, a cell population recognized as a major reservoir in infected individuals. This study supports the hypothesis that translocation of microbes that can engage pathogen recognition receptors might play a dominant role in chronic immune activation seen in HIV-1-infected individuals and promote virus replication and dissemination."
19460346,0,J. Mol. Biol.,2985088R,2009,Understanding the functional roles of amino acid residues in enzyme catalysis.,"The MACiE database contains 223 distinct step-wise enzyme reaction mechanisms and holds representatives from each EC sub-subclass where there is a crystal structure and sufficient evidence in the literature to support a mechanism. Each catalytic step of every reaction sequence in MACiE is fully annotated so that it includes the function of the catalytic residues involved in the reaction and the mechanism by which substrates are transformed into products. Using MACiE as a knowledge base, we have seen that the top 10 most catalytic residues are histidine, aspartate, glutamate, lysine, cysteine, arginine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Of these only seven (cysteine, histidine, aspartate, lysine, serine, threonine and tyrosine) dominate catalysis and provide essentially five functional roles that are essential. Stabilisation is the most common and essential role for all classes of enzyme, followed by general acid/base (proton acceptor and proton donor) functionality, with nucleophilic addition following closely behind (nucleophile and nucleofuge). We investigated the occurrence of these residues in MACiE and the Catalytic Site Atlas and found that, as expected, certain residue types are associated with each functional role, with some residue types able to perform diverse roles. In addition, it was seen that different EC classes of enzyme have a tendency to employ different residues for catalysis. Further, we show that whilst the differences between EC classes in catalytic residue composition are not immediately obvious from the general classes of Ingold mechanisms, there is some weak correlation between the mechanisms involved in a given EC class and the functions that the catalytic amino acid residues are performing. The analysis presented here provides a valuable insight into the functional roles of catalytic amino acid residues, which may have applications in many aspects of enzymology, from the design of novel enzymes to the prediction and validation of enzyme reaction mechanisms."

Introduced in 1994, our Flp recombinase-mediated cassette exchange strategy permits the exchange of a target cassette for a cassette with the gene of interest, introduced as a part of an exchange vector. The process is &quot;clean&quot; in the sense that it does not co-introduce prokaryotic vector parts; neither does it leave behind a selection marker. Stringent selection principles provide master cell lines permitting subsequent recombinase-mediated cassette exchange cycles in the absence of a drug selection and with a considerable efficiency (approximately 10%). Exemplified by Chinese hamster ovary cells, the strategy proves to be successful even for cell lines with an unstable genotype."
19460752,0,Neuron,8809320,2009,Reading the clock: how Purkinje cells decode the phase of olivary oscillations.,"Climbing fiber responses in cerebellar Purkinje cells are described as being invariant. In this issue of Neuron, Mathy et al. show that the complex spike waveform changes with the number of spikes in a climbing fiber burst, which depends on the phase of olivary oscillations. In turn, different complex spike profiles affect synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. Thus, information on inferior olive oscillation states is reflected in both the complex spike waveform and the parallel fiber input gain."

19461654,1,Structure,101087697,2009,Crystal structures of two archaeal 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases provide structural insight into guanine/8-oxoguanine distinction.,"Among the four DNA bases, guanine is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and the most common oxidative product, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), is the most prevalent lesion observed in DNA molecules. Fortunately, 8-oxoG is recognized and excised by the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg) of the base excision repair pathway. Ogg enzymes are divided into three separate families, namely, Ogg1, Ogg2, and archaeal GO glycosylase (AGOG). To date, structures of members of both Ogg1 and AGOG families are known but no structural information is available for members of Ogg2. Here we describe the first crystal structures of two archaeal Ogg2: Methanocaldococcus janischii Ogg and Sulfolobus solfataricus Ogg. A structural comparison with OGG1 and AGOG suggested that the C-terminal lysine of Ogg2 may play a key role in discriminating between guanine and 8-oxoG. This prediction was substantiated by measuring the glycosylase/lyase activity of a C-terminal deletion mutant of MjaOgg."
19461882,0,Cell,413066,2009,Multiple assembly chaperones govern biogenesis of the proteasome regulatory particle base.,"The central protease of eukaryotes, the 26S proteasome, has a 20S proteolytic core particle (CP) and an attached 19S regulatory particle (RP). The RP is further subdivided into lid and base subcomplexes. Little is known about RP assembly. Here, we show that four conserved assembly factors govern biogenesis of the yeast RP base. Nas2 forms a complex with the Rpt4 and Rpt5 ATPases and enhances 26S proteasome formation in vivo and in vitro. Other RP subcomplexes contain Hsm3, which is related to mammalian proteasome subunit S5b. Hsm3 also contributes to base assembly. Larger Hsm3-containing complexes include two additional proteins, Nas6 and Rpn14, which function as assembly chaperones as well. Specific deletion combinations affecting these four factors cause severe perturbations to RP assembly. Our results demonstrate that proteasomal RP biogenesis requires multiple, functionally overlapping chaperones and suggest a model in which subunits form specific subcomplexes that then assemble into the base."
19461884,0,Cell,413066,2009,DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.,"The mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival. We identify DEPTOR as an mTOR-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. Loss of DEPTOR activates S6K1, Akt, and SGK1, promotes cell growth and survival, and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities. DEPTOR overexpression suppresses S6K1 but, by relieving feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K signaling, activates Akt. Consistent with many human cancers having activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways, DEPTOR expression is low in most cancers. Surprisingly, DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in a subset of multiple myelomas harboring cyclin D1/D3 or c-MAF/MAFB translocations. In these cells, high DEPTOR expression is necessary to maintain PI3K and Akt activation and a reduction in DEPTOR levels leads to apoptosis. Thus, we identify a novel mTOR-interacting protein whose deregulated overexpression in multiple myeloma cells represents a mechanism for activating PI3K/Akt signaling and promoting cell survival."
19461886,1,Mol. Plant Microbe Interact.,9107902,2009,Interaction with a host ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme is required for the pathogenicity of a geminiviral DNA beta satellite.,"DNA beta is a single-stranded satellite DNA which encodes a single gene, betaC1. To better understand the role of betaC1 in the pathogenicity of DNA beta, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a tomato cDNA library was carried out using betaC1 from Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV) DNA beta as the bait. A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, designated SlUBC3, which functionally complemented a yeast mutant deficient in ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes was identified. The authenticity and specificity of the interaction between betaC1 and SlUBC3 was confirmed both in vivo, using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, and in vitro, using a protein-binding assay. Analysis of deletion mutants of the betaC1 protein showed that a myristoylation-like motif is required both for its interaction with SlUBC3 and the induction of DNA-beta-specific symptoms in host plants. The level of polyubiquitinated proteins in transgenic tobacco plants expressing betaC1 was found to be reduced compared with wild-type plants. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interaction of betaC1 with SlUBC3 is required for DNA-beta-specific symptom induction, and that this is possibly due to downregulation of the host ubiquitin proteasome pathway."

Plant Microbe Interact.,9107902,2009,Nitric oxide as a partner of reactive oxygen species participates in disease resistance to nectrotophic pathogen Botryis cinerea in Nicotiana benthamiana.,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential regulatory molecule in plant immunity in synergy with reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, little is known about the role of NO in disease resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. NO and oxidative bursts were induced during necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea and Nicotiana benthamiana compatible interaction. Histochemical analyses showed that both NO and ROS were produced in adjacent cells of invaded areas in N. benthamiana leaves. Activation of salicylic acid-induced protein kinase, which regulates the radical burst, and several defense-related genes were induced after inoculation of B. cinerea. Loss-of-function analyses using inhibitors and virus-induced gene silencing were done to investigate the role of the radical burst in pathogenesis. We showed that NO plays a pivotal role in basal defense against B. cinerea and PR-1 gene expression in N. benthamiana. By contrast, ROS function has a negative role in resistance or has a positive role in expansion of disease lesions during B. cinerea-N. benthamiana interaction."
19461960,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Structure and function of Vps15 in the endosomal G protein signaling pathway.,"G protein-coupled receptors mediate cellular responses to a wide variety of stimuli, including taste, light, and neurotransmitters. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of the pheromone pathway triggers events leading to mating. The view had long been held that the G protein-mediated signal occurs principally at the plasma membrane. Recently, it has been shown that the G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 can promote signaling at endosomes and requires two components of the sole phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase in yeast, Vps15 and Vps34. Vps15 contains multiple WD repeats and also binds to Gpa1 preferentially in the GDP-bound state; these observations led us to hypothesize that Vps15 may function as a G protein beta subunit at the endosome. Here we show an X-ray crystal structure of the Vps15 WD domain that reveals a seven-bladed propeller resembling that of typical Gbeta subunits. We show further that the WD domain is sufficient to bind Gpa1 as well as to Atg14, a potential Ggamma protein that exists in a complex with Vps15. The Vps15 kinase domain together with the intermediate domain (linking the kinase and WD domains) also contributes to Gpa1 binding and is necessary for Vps15 to sustain G protein signaling. These findings reveal that the Vps15 Gbeta-like domain serves as a scaffold to assemble Gpa1 and Atg14, whereas the kinase and intermediate domains are required for proper signaling at the endosome."

In order to identify a nodulisporamide suitable for monthly oral dosing in dogs, a library of 335 nodulisporamides was examined in an artificial flea feeding system for intrinsic systemic potency as well as in a mouse/bedbug assay for systemic efficacy and safety. A cohort of 66 nodulisporamides were selected for evaluation in a dog/flea model; pharmacokinetic analysis correlated plasma levels with flea efficacy. These efforts resulted in the identification of the development candidate N-tert-butyl nodulisporamide (3) as a potent and efficacious once monthly oral agent for the control of fleas and ticks on dogs and cats which was directly compared to the topical agents fipronil and imidacloprid, with favorable results obtained. Multidose studies over 3 months confirmed the in vivo ectoparasiticidal efficacy and established that 3 lacked overt mammalian toxicity. Tissue distribution studies in mice using [(14)C]-labeled 3 indicate that adipose beds serve as ligand depots, contributing to the long terminal half-lives of these compounds."

The synthesis combines the rhodium-catalyzed [4 + 3] cycloaddition between a vinylcarbenoid and a diene to rapidly generate the tricyclic core with an effective end game strategy to introduce the remaining side-chains. The [4 + 3] cycloaddition occurs by a cyclopropanation to form a divinylcyclopropane followed by a Cope rearrangement to form a cycloheptadiene. The quaternary stereogenic center generated in the process can be obtained with high asymmetric induction when the reaction is catalyzed by the chiral dirhodium complex, Rh(2)(S-PTAD)(4)."
19462008,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Sequoia regulates cell fate decisions in the external sensory organs of adult Drosophila.,"The adult Drosophila external sensory organ (ESO), comprising the hair, socket, neuron, sheath and glia cells, arises through the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs). In a mosaic screen designed to identify new components in ESO development, we isolated mutations in sequoia, which encodes a putative zinc-finger transcription factor that has previously been shown to have a role in dendritogenesis. Here, we show that adult clones mutant for seq exhibit a loss of hair cells and a gain of socket cells. We propose that the seq mutant phenotype arises, in part, owing to the loss of several crucial transcription factors known to be important in peripheral nervous system development such as D-Pax2, Prospero and Hamlet. Thus, Sequoia is a new upstream regulator of genes that orchestrates cell fate specification during development of the adult ESO lineage."
19462950,0,Nature,410462,2009,Radiation-pressure mixing of large dust grains in protoplanetary disks.,"Dusty disks around young stars are formed out of interstellar dust that consists of amorphous, submicrometre grains. Yet the grains found in comets and meteorites, and traced in the spectra of young stars, include large crystalline grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K, even though they are mixed with surrounding material that never experienced temperatures as high as that. This prompted theories of large-scale mixing capable of transporting thermally altered grains from the inner, hot part of accretion disks to outer, colder disk regions, but all have assumptions that may be problematic. Here I report that infrared radiation arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of the inner disk, whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation pressure while gliding above the disk. Grains re-enter the disk at radii where it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation-pressure support for a given grain size and solid density. Properties of the observed disks suggest that this process might be active in almost all young stellar objects and young brown dwarfs."
19463002,0,Science,404511,2009,MAPK3/1 (ERK1/2) in ovarian granulosa cells are essential for female fertility.,"A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, we disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse granulosa cells and provide in vivo evidence that these kinases are necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption of the Cebpb gene in granulosa cells demonstrate that C/EBPbeta (CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein-beta) is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus, ERK1/2 and C/EBPbeta constitute an in vivo LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and luteinization-related events."
19463149,0,Science,404511,2009,Input-specific spine entry of soma-derived Vesl-1S protein conforms to synaptic tagging.,"Late-phase synaptic plasticity depends on the synthesis of new proteins that must function only in the activated synapses. The synaptic tag hypothesis requires input-specific functioning of these proteins after undirected transport. Confirmation of this hypothesis requires specification of a biochemical tagging activity and an example protein that behaves as the hypothesis predicts. We found that in rat neurons, soma-derived Vesl-1S (Homer-1a) protein, a late-phase plasticity-related synaptic protein, prevailed in every dendrite and did not enter spines. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation triggered input-specific spine entry of Vesl-1S proteins, which met many criteria for synaptic tagging. These results suggest that Vesl-1S supports the hypothesis and that the activity-dependent regulation of spine entry functions as a synaptic tag."
19463186,0,Science,404511,2009,A key role for similarity in vicarious reward.,"Humans appear to have an inherent prosocial tendency toward one another in that we often take pleasure in seeing others succeed. This fact is almost certainly exploited by game shows, yet why watching others win elicits a pleasurable vicarious rewarding feeling in the absence of personal economic gain is unclear. One explanation is that game shows use contestants who have similarities to the viewing population, thereby kindling kin-motivated responses (for example, prosocial behavior). Using a game show-inspired paradigm, we show that the interactions between the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex subserve the modulation of vicarious reward by similarity, respectively. Our results support studies showing that similarity acts as a proximate neurobiological mechanism where prosocial behavior extends to unrelated strangers."
19463193,0,Science,404511,2009,Diversity and complexity in DNA recognition by transcription factors.,"Sequence preferences of DNA binding proteins are a primary mechanism by which cells interpret the genome. Despite the central importance of these proteins in physiology, development, and evolution, comprehensive DNA binding specificities have been determined experimentally for only a few proteins. Here, we used microarrays containing all 10-base pair sequences to examine the binding specificities of 104 distinct mouse DNA binding proteins representing 22 structural classes. Our results reveal a complex landscape of binding, with virtually every protein analyzed possessing unique preferences. Roughly half of the proteins each recognized multiple distinctly different sequence motifs, challenging our molecular understanding of how proteins interact with their DNA binding sites. This complexity in DNA recognition may be important in gene regulation and in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks."

In this study, we show that interleukin-21 (IL-21), likely produced by CD4+ T cells, directly influences the generation of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells and that the number of CD4+ T cells that produce IL-21 differs markedly between acute and chronic infections. IL-21 regulates the development of CD8+ T cell exhaustion and the ability to contain chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. Thus, IL-21 serves as a critical helper factor that shapes the functional quality of antiviral CD8+ T cells and is required for viral control."

Sci.,7703701,2009,"Effect of bimatoprost, latanoprost, and unoprostone on matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in human ciliary body smooth muscle cells.","PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) affects outflow resistance in the uveoscleral pathway. The balance of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) governs the rate of ECM turnover in many tissues. The hypothesis was that a differential effect on MMPs and TIMPs in ciliary body smooth muscle (CBSM) cells would relate to the relative intraocular pressure-lowering effectiveness of the prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) bimatoprost, latanoprost, and unoprostone. METHODS: Human CBSM cells isolated from donor corneoscleral rims were incubated for 24 hours with control (0.015% ethanol in DMEM) or the free acid forms of bimatoprost (0.01 or 0.1 microg/mL), latanoprost (0.03 or 0.3 microg/mL), or unoprostone (0.145 or 1.45 microg/mL). Western blot analysis determined the relative protein concentrations of MMP-1, -2, -3. -9, and -24 as well as TIMP-1 through -4. Zymography measured the relative activity levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, and -9. RESULTS: All PGAs increased MMP-1, -3, and -9. Bimatoprost and latanoprost did not change MMP-2. Unoprostone decreased MMP-2 (21% +/- 3%). On zymography, MMP-1 and -2 did not change. Bimatoprost and latanoprost increased MMP-9 activity by 75% +/- 27% and 75% +/- 24%, respectively. MMP-3 activity was not detected on zymography. All PGAs increased TIMP-3, but only unoprostone increased TIMPs1 and -4 by 100% +/- 20% and 61% +/- 11%, respectively. TIMP-2 was unchanged by bimatoprost and latanoprost, but decreased by unoprostone (35% +/- 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased MMP-2 with concurrent increases of TIMP-1 and -4 by unoprostone may explain the lower clinical efficacy of unoprostone. The MMP/TIMP balance relates to the observed intraocular pressure-lowering effectiveness in clinical studies with PGAs."

METHODS: RvE1, RvD1, and markers of their biosynthesis were determined by lipidomic analysis. After CRECs or cocultures of CRECs and leukocytes were treated with RvE1 or RvD1 and inflammatory stimuli, inflammatory signaling molecules were quantified by Western blot analysis, ELISA, or protein array. Transmigration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) across CRECs monolayers was quantified. RESULTS: Inflammatory stimulation increased the biosynthesis of RvE1 and RvD1 from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, in coculture of CRECs and leukocytes. CRECs alone did not produce RvE1 and RvD1. RvE1 or RvD1 inhibited the expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from CRECs or cocultures of CRECs and leukocytes. RvD1 reduced prostaglandin E(2) generation from CRECs. However, neither resolvin affected cyclooxygenase-2 formation. Treating CRECs or PMNs with RvE1 or RvD1 inhibited PMN transmigration across CREC barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The interplay of inflammatory stimuli-activated CRECs and leukocytes biosynthesizes RvE1 and RvD1 from EPA and DHA. These resolvins inhibit inflammatory signaling from CRECs and leukocytes and inflammatory activity as PMN transmigration across CRECs barriers. Thus, these resolvins and their biosynthesis pathways are potential targets for novel treatment of inflammatory ocular diseases."

Sci.,7703701,2009,Is routine pupil dilation safe among asian patients with diabetes?,"PURPOSE: To investigate the risk of acute angle closure (AAC), changes in intraocular pressure (IOP), and factors associated with these outcomes after routine pupil dilation in a cohort of Asian subjects with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The study was a prospective observational case series of 1910 consecutive Asian subjects newly referred for assessment of diabetic retinopathy at a tertiary clinic. All subjects underwent routine pupil dilation unless there was a prior history of angle-closure glaucoma. Noncontact air-puff tonometry was used to assess IOP, which was measured by the same observer before and 1 hour after pupil dilation. Subjects were assessed for signs and symptoms of AAC before leaving the clinic, and their charts were also subsequently reviewed for revisits with AAC. RESULTS: Of the 1910 subjects who participated, none developed AAC. Sixty-nine subjects (3.6%, 95% CI: 2.8%-4.5%) showed an increase in IOP of &gt;or=5 mm Hg in the either eye, 37 subjects (1.9%, 95% CI: 1.4%-2.6%) had a postdilation IOP &gt;25 mm Hg in either eye, and only 10 subjects (0.52%, 95% CI: 0.25%-0.96%) had an increase in IOP &gt;or=5 mm Hg and had a postdilation IOP &gt;25 mm Hg in either eye. The level of predilation IOP and a known history of glaucoma were significant risk factors for a postdilation IOP &gt;or=25 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of Asian persons with diabetes, the risk of AAC was insignificant after routine dilation of pupils for fundus examination. These data substantiate the safety of routine dilation of pupils in Asian patients with diabetes."
19464253,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Eye movement abnormalities in Joubert syndrome.,"PURPOSE: Joubert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypoplasia of the midline cerebellum and deficiency of crossed connections between neural structures in the brain stem that control eye movements. The goal of the study was to quantify the eye movement abnormalities that occur in Joubert syndrome. METHODS: Eye movements were recorded in response to stationary stimuli and stimuli designed to elicit smooth pursuit, saccades, optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and vergence using video-oculography or Skalar search coils in 8 patients with Joubert syndrome. All patients underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: All patients had the highly characteristic molar tooth sign on brain MRI. Six patients had conjugate pendular (n = 4) or see-saw nystagmus (n = 2); gaze holding was stable in four patients. Smooth-pursuit gains were 0.28 to 1.19, 0.11 to 0.68, and 0.33 to 0.73 at peak stimulus velocities of 10, 20, and 30 deg/s in six patients; smooth pursuit could not be elicited in four patients. Saccade gains in five patients ranged from 0.35 to 0.91 and velocities ranged from 60.9 to 259.5 deg/s. Targeted saccades could not be elicited in five patients. Horizontal OKN gain was uniformly reduced across gratings drifted at velocities of 15, 30, and 45 deg/s. VOR gain was 0.8 or higher and phase appropriate in three of seven subjects; VOR gain was 0.3 or less and phase was indeterminate in four subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormalities in gaze-holding and eye movements are consistent with the distributed abnormalities of midline cerebellum and brain stem regions associated with Joubert syndrome."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,"Neurotensin induces IL-6 secretion in mouse preadipocytes and adipose tissues during 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzensulphonic acid-induced colitis.","Mesenteric fat is known to undergo inflammatory changes after 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzensulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Neurotensin (NT) and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) have been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. This led us to explore whether NT and NTR1 are expressed in the mesenteric fat depots during TNBS-induced colitis and whether NT participates in the increased interleukin (IL)-6 secretion in this inflammatory response. TNBS-induced inflammation in the colon increases NT and NTR1 expression in mesenteric adipose tissues, including mesenteric preadipocytes. Compared with wild-type mice, NT knockout (KO) mice have reduced TNBS-induced colitis accompanied by diminished inflammatory responses in mesenteric adipose tissue. Specifically, IL-6 and p65 phosphorylation levels in mesenteric fat of NT KO mice are also reduced compared with wild-type mice. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes express NTR1 and its expression is increased after stimulation of preadipocytes with proinflammatory cytokines. NT stimulation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes overexpressing NTR1 causes PKCdelta phosphorylation and IL-6 secretion in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, NT-mediated IL-6 expression is nuclear factor-kappaB and PKCdelta dependent. We also found that supernatants from NT-exposed 3T3-L1-NTR1 preadipocytes and mesenteric fat obtained from wild-type mice 2 days after TNBS administration stimulate an IL-6-dependent macrophage migration measured by a macrophage migration assay, whereas this response is reduced when mesenteric fat from NT KO mice is used. These results demonstrate an important role for NT in acute colitis and adipose tissue inflammation associated with experimental colitis that involves direct NT proinflammatory responses in preadipocytes."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Conformational transition associated with E1-E2 interaction in small ubiquitin-like modifications.,"Ubiquitin-like modifications regulate nearly every aspect of cellular functions. A key step in these modifications is the recognition of the carrier enzyme (E2) by the activating enzyme (E1). In this study, we have found that a critical E2-binding surface on the E1 of the small ubiquitin-like modifier has unusually high populations in both ordered and disordered states. Upon binding the E2, the disordered state is converted to the ordered state, which resembles the structure of the bound conformation, providing a mechanism to resolve the &quot;Levinthal Paradox&quot; search problem in a folding-upon-binding process. The significance of the folding-unfolding equilibrium is shown by the loss of functions of the mutations that shift the equilibrium to the folded state. This study highlights the importance of conformational flexibility in the molecular recognition event."
19464298,0,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2009,Evolution of petal identity.,"Petals appear in many angiosperm taxa, yet when and how these attractive organs originated remains unclear. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on morphological data suggest that petals have evolved multiple times during the radiation of the angiosperms. Based on the diversity of petal morphologies, it is likely that the developmental programmes specifying petal identity are distinct in different lineages. On the other hand, molecular genetic analyses have suggested that the specification of petal identity in different lineages utilizes similar genetic pathways. Together, these observations indicate that the evolution of petals has relied on the repeated recruitment of a suite of interacting developmental control genes, albeit in different ways in different lineages. These observations suggest that this gene regulatory network represents a 'deep homology' in plant evolution. A major challenge is to understand how this ancestral developmental pathway has been redeployed in different angiosperm lineages, and how changes in the workings of this pathway have led to the myriad shapes, colours, and sizes of petals."
19464721,0,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2009,Risk for nicotine dependence and lung cancer is conferred by mRNA expression levels and amino acid change in CHRNA5.,"Nicotine dependence risk and lung cancer risk are associated with variants in a region of chromosome 15 encompassing genes encoding the nicotinic receptor subunits CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4. To identify potential biological mechanisms that underlie this risk, we tested for cis-acting eQTLs for CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 in human brain. Using gene expression and disease association studies, we provide evidence that both nicotine-dependence risk and lung cancer risk are influenced by functional variation in CHRNA5. We demonstrated that the risk allele of rs16969968 primarily occurs on the low mRNA expression allele of CHRNA5. The non-risk allele at rs16969968 occurs on both high and low expression alleles tagged by rs588765 within CHRNA5. When the non-risk allele occurs on the background of low mRNA expression of CHRNA5, the risk for nicotine dependence and lung cancer is significantly lower compared to those with the higher mRNA expression. Together, these variants identify three levels of risk associated with CHRNA5. We conclude that there are at least two distinct mechanisms conferring risk for nicotine dependence and lung cancer: altered receptor function caused by a D398N amino acid variant in CHRNA5 (rs16969968) and variability in CHRNA5 mRNA expression."
19464723,0,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,p53-dependent antiviral RNA-interference facilitates tumor-selective viral replication.,"RNA-interference (RNAi) is a potent tool for specific gene silencing. In this study, we developed an adenovirus for conditional replication in p53-dysfunctional tumor cells that uses p53-selective expression of a microRNA-network directed against essential adenoviral genes. Compared to a control virus that expressed a scrambled microRNA-network, antiviral RNAi selectively attenuated viral replication in cells with transcriptionally active p53, but not in p53-dysfunctional tumor cells where both viruses replicated equivalently. Since these results were confirmed by an in vivo comparison of both viruses after infection of p53-knockout and normal mice, we could demonstrate that attenuated replication was indeed a result of p53-selective exhibition of antiviral RNAi. Addressing the therapeutic applicability, we could show that the application of RNAi-controlled virus efficiently lysed p53-dysfunctional tumors in vitro and in vivo but resulted in drastically reduced load of virus-DNA in the liver of treated mice. We have generated a broadly applicable adenovirus for selective destruction of p53-dysfunctional tumors and thereby demonstrate that virus-encoded RNAi-networks represent an efficient and versatile tool to modify viral functions. RNAi-networks can be applied to all transcriptionally regulated DNA-viruses to remodulate viral tropism and thus provide means to generate specifically replicating vectors for clinical applications."
19464985,0,Cancer Lett.,7600053,2009,The genotoxic air pollutant 3-nitrobenzanthrone and its reactive metabolite N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone lack initiating and complete carcinogenic activity in NMRI mouse skin.,"3-Nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA), a genotoxic mutagen found in diesel exhaust and ambient air pollution and its active metabolite N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-3-ABA) were tested for initiating and complete carcinogenic activity in the NMRI mouse skin carcinogenesis model. Both compounds were found to be inactive as either tumour initiators or complete carcinogens in mouse skin over a dose range of 25-400nmol. Topical application of 3-NBA and N-OH-3-ABA produced DNA adduct patterns in epidermis, detected by (32)P-postlabelling, similar to those found previously in other organs of rats and mice. 24h after a single treatment of 100nmol DNA adduct levels produced by 3-NBA (18+/-4 adducts/10(8) nucleotides) were 6 times lower than those by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA; 114+/-37 adducts/10(8) nucleotides). In contrast, identical treatment with N-OH-3-ABA resulted in adduct levels in the same range as with DMBA (136+/-25 adducts/10(8) nucleotides), indicating that initial DNA adduct levels do not parallel tumour initiating activity. When compounds were tested for tumour initiating activity by a single treatment followed by twice-weekly applications of TPA, DNA adducts formed by DMBA, but not by 3-NBA or N-OH-3-ABA, were still detectable 40weeks after treatment. When tested for activity as complete carcinogens by twice-weekly topical application, 3-NBA and N-OH-3-ABA produced identical DNA adduct profiles in mouse skin, with adducts still detectable after 40weeks. Only 3-NBA produced detectable adducts in other organs."
19464997,0,Biochem. Soc. Trans.,7506897,2009,The impact of heterochromatin on DSB repair.,"DNA NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining) is the major DNA DSB (double-strand break) repair pathway in mammalian cells. Although NHEJ-defective cell lines show marked DSB-repair defects, cells defective in ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) repair most DSBs normally. Thus NHEJ functions independently of ATM signalling. However, approximately 15% of radiation-induced DSBs are repaired with slow kinetics and require ATM and the nuclease Artemis. DSBs persisting in the presence of an ATM inhibitor, ATMi, localize to heterochromatin, suggesting that ATM is required for repairing DSBs arising within or close to heterochromatin. Consistent with this, we show that siRNA (small interfering RNA) of key heterochromatic proteins, including KAP-1 [KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain-associated protein 1], HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) 1/2, relieves the requirement for ATM for DSB repair. Furthermore, ATMi addition to cell lines with genetic alterations that have an impact on heterochromatin, including Suv39H1/2 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1/2)-knockout, ICFa (immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies syndrome type a) and Hutchinson-Guilford progeria cell lines, fails to have an impact on DSB repair. KAP-1 is a highly dose-dependent, transient and ATM-specific substrate, and mutation of the ATM phosphorylation site on KAP-1 influences DSB repair. Collectively, the findings show that ATM functions to overcome the barrier to DSB repair posed by heterochromatin. However, even in the presence of ATM, gamma-H2AX (phosphorylated histone H2AX) foci form on the periphery rather than within heterochromatic centres. Finally, we show that KAP-1's association with heterochromatin is diminished as cells progress through mitosis. We propose that KAP-1 is a critical heterochromatic factor that undergoes specific modifications to promote DSB repair and mitotic progression in a manner that allows localized and transient chromatin relaxation, but precludes significant dismantling of the heterochromatic superstructure."

Trans.,7506897,2009,The search for a human Holliday junction resolvase.,"Four-way DNA intermediates, known as Holliday junctions, are formed during mitotic and meiotic recombination, and their efficient resolution is essential for proper chromosome segregation. Bacteria, bacteriophages and archaea promote Holliday junction resolution by the introduction of symmetrically related nicks across the junction, in reactions mediated by Holliday junction resolvases. In 2008, after a search that lasted almost 20 years, a Holliday junction resolvase was identified in humans. The protein, GEN1, was identified using MS following the brute-force fractionation of extracts prepared from human cells grown in tissue culture. GEN1 fits the paradigm developed from studies of prokaryotic Holliday junction resolvases, in that it specifically recognizes junctions and resolves them using a mechanism similar to that exhibited by the Escherichia coli RuvC protein."

J.,2984726R,2009,"Glycyrrhizin, the main active compound in liquorice, attenuates pro-inflammatory responses by interfering with membrane-dependent receptor signalling.","The triterpene glycoside glycyrrhizin is the main active compound in liquorice. It is used as a herbal medicine owing to its anticancer, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Its mode of action, however, remains widely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of glycyrrhizin in attenuating inflammatory responses in macrophages. Using microarray analysis, we found that glycyrrhizin caused a broad block in the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by the TLR (Toll-like receptor) 9 agonist CpG-DNA in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, we found that glycyrrhizin also strongly attenuated inflammatory responses induced by TLR3 and TLR4 ligands. The inhibition was accompanied by decreased activation not only of the NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) pathway but also of the parallel MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling cascade upon stimulation with TLR9 and TLR4 agonists. Further analysis of upstream events revealed that glycyrrhizin treatment decreased cellular attachment and/or uptake of CpG-DNA and strongly impaired TLR4 internalization. Moreover, we found that the anti-inflammatory effects were specific for membrane-dependent receptor-mediated stimuli, as glycyrrhizin was ineffective in blocking Tnfa (tumour necrosis factor alpha gene) induction upon stimulation with PMA, a receptor- and membrane-independent stimulus. These observations suggest that the broad anti-inflammatory activity of glycyrrhizin is mediated by the interaction with the lipid bilayer, thereby attenuating receptor-mediated signalling."
19465386,0,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,Dynasore inhibits removal of wild-type and DeltaF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from the plasma membrane.,"Dynasore, a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin, was used to probe the role of dynamin in the endocytosis of wild-type and mutant CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Internalization of both wild-type and 'temperature-corrected' DeltaF508 CFTR was markedly inhibited by a short exposure to dynasore, implicating dynamin as a key element in the endocytic internalization of both wild-type and mutant CFTR. The inhibitory effect of dynasore was readily reversible upon washout of dynasore from the growth media. Corr-4 ({2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-4'-methyl-[4,5']-bithiazolyl-2'-yl}-phenyl-methanonone), a pharmacological corrector of DeltaF508 CFTR biosynthesis, caused a marked increase in the cell surface expression of mutant CFTR. Co-incubation of DeltaF508 CFTR expressing cells with Corr-4 and dynasore caused a significantly greater level of cell surface CFTR than that observed in the presence of Corr-4 alone. These results argue that inhibiting the endocytic internalization of mutant CFTR provides a novel therapeutic target for augmenting the benefits of small molecule correctors of mutant CFTR biosynthesis."

Efforts to identify pathways for catalyst degradation and/or arrest have revealed a single-electron oxidation event that gives rise to a red-colored, mixed-valence dimer, [Rh(2)(esp)(2)](+). This species is fortuitously reduced by carboxylic acid, a byproduct generated in the reaction cycle with each turnover of the diacyloxyiodine oxidant. These findings have led to the conclusion that the high performance of Rh(2)(esp)(2) is due in part to the superior kinetic stability of its one-electron oxidized form relative to other dimeric Rh complexes."

Slow diffusion coefficients characteristic of large biomolecules can be determined by combining LLS methods with moderate pulsed field gradients (PFGs) available on commercial probeheads, as the extension of spin memory reduces the strain on the duration and/or strength of the PFGs.

19465915,1,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Understanding how diverse beta-mannanases recognize heterogeneous substrates.,"The mechanism by which polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes manifest specificity toward heterogeneous substrates, in which the sequence of sugars is variable, is unclear. An excellent example of such heterogeneity is provided by the plant structural polysaccharide glucomannan, which comprises a backbone of beta-1,4-linked glucose and mannose units. beta-Mannanases, located in glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 5 and 26, hydrolyze glucomannan by cleaving the glycosidic bond of mannosides at the -1 subsite. The mechanism by which these enzymes select for glucose or mannose at distal subsites, which is critical to defining their substrate specificity on heterogeneous polymers, is currently unclear. Here we report the biochemical properties and crystal structures of both a GH5 mannanase and a GH26 mannanase and describe the contributions to substrate specificity in these enzymes. The GH5 enzyme, BaMan5A, derived from Bacillus agaradhaerens, can accommodate glucose or mannose at both its -2 and +1 subsites, while the GH26 Bacillus subtilis mannanase, BsMan26A, displays tight specificity for mannose at its negative binding sites. The crystal structure of BaMan5A reveals that a polar residue at the -2 subsite can make productive contact with the substrate 2-OH group in either its axial (as in mannose) or its equatorial (as in glucose) configuration, while other distal subsites do not exploit the 2-OH group as a specificity determinant. Thus, BaMan5A is able to hydrolyze glucomannan in which the sequence of glucose and mannose is highly variable. The crystal structure of BsMan26A in light of previous studies on the Cellvibrio japonicus GH26 mannanases CjMan26A and CjMan26C reveals that the tighter mannose recognition at the -2 subsite is mediated by polar interactions with the axial 2-OH group of a (4)C(1) ground state mannoside. Mutagenesis studies showed that variants of CjMan26A, from which these polar residues had been removed, do not distinguish between Man and Glc at the -2 subsite, while one of these residues, Arg 361, confers the elevated activity displayed by the enzyme against mannooligosaccharides. The biological rationale for the variable recognition of Man- and Glc-configured sugars by beta-mannanases is discussed."
19465916,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Accurate measurement of methyl 13C chemical shifts by solid-state NMR for the determination of protein side chain conformation: the influenza a M2 transmembrane peptide as an example.,"The use of side chain methyl (13)C chemical shifts for the determination of the rotameric conformation of Val and Leu residues in proteins by solid-state NMR spectroscopy is described. Examination of the solution NMR stereospecifically assigned methyl groups shows significant correlation between the difference in the two methyl carbons' chemical shifts and the side chain conformation. It is found that alpha-helical and beta-sheet backbones cause different side chain methyl chemical shift trends. In alpha-helical Leu's, a relatively large absolute methyl (13)C shift difference of 2.89 ppm is found for the most populated mt rotamer (chi(1) = -60 degrees, chi(2) = 180 degrees), while a much smaller value of 0.73 ppm is found for the next populated tp rotamer (chi(1) = 180 degrees, chi(2) = 60 degrees). For alpha-helical Val residues, the dominant t rotamer (chi(1) = 180 degrees) has more downfield Cgamma2 chemical shifts than Cgamma1 by 1.71 ppm, while the next populated m rotamer (chi(1) = -60 degrees) shows the opposite trend of more downfield Cgamma1 chemical shift by 1.23 ppm. These significantly different methyl (13)C chemical shifts exist despite the likelihood of partial rotameric averaging at ambient temperature. We show that these conformation-dependent methyl (13)C chemical shifts can be utilized for side chain structure determination once the methyl (13)C resonances are accurately measured by double-quantum (DQ) filtered 2D correlation experiments, most notably the dipolar DQ to single-quantum (SQ) correlation technique. The advantage of the DQ-SQ correlation experiment over simple 2D SQ-SQ correlation experiments is demonstrated on the transmembrane peptide of the influenza A M2 proton channel. The methyl chemical shifts led to predictions of the side chain rotameric states for several Val and Leu residues in this tetrameric helical bundle. The predicted Val rotamers were further verified by dipolar correlation experiments that directly measure the chi(1) torsion angles. It was found that the chemical-shift-predicted side chain conformations are fully consistent with the direct torsion angle results; moreover, the methyl (13)C chemical shifts are sensitive to approximately 5 degrees changes in the chi(1) torsion angle due to drug binding."
19465921,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Nutrient enrichment increases mortality of mangroves.,"Nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone places intense pressure on marine communities. Previous studies have shown that growth of intertidal mangrove forests is accelerated with enhanced nutrient availability. However, nutrient enrichment favours growth of shoots relative to roots, thus enhancing growth rates but increasing vulnerability to environmental stresses that adversely affect plant water relations. Two such stresses are high salinity and low humidity, both of which require greater investment in roots to meet the demands for water by the shoots. Here we present data from a global network of sites that documents enhanced mortality of mangroves with experimental nutrient enrichment at sites where high sediment salinity was coincident with low rainfall and low humidity. Thus the benefits of increased mangrove growth in response to coastal eutrophication is offset by the costs of decreased resilience due to mortality during drought, with mortality increasing with soil water salinity along climatic gradients."
19465923,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Lysophosphatidic acid-induced transcriptional profile represents serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma and worsened prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) governs a number of physiologic and pathophysiological processes. Malignant ascites fluid is rich in LPA, and LPA receptors are aberrantly expressed by ovarian cancer cells, implicating LPA in the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. However, there is an absence of systematic data critically analyzing the transcriptional changes induced by LPA in ovarian cancer. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, gene expression profiling was used to examine LPA-mediated transcription by exogenously adding LPA to human epithelial ovarian cancer cells for 24 h to mimic long-term stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. The resultant transcriptional profile comprised a 39-gene signature that closely correlated to serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Hierarchical clustering of ovarian cancer patient specimens demonstrated that the signature is associated with worsened prognosis. Patients with LPA-signature-positive ovarian tumors have reduced disease-specific and progression-free survival times. They have a higher frequency of stage IIIc serous carcinoma and a greater proportion is deceased. Among the 39-gene signature, a group of seven genes associated with cell adhesion recapitulated the results. Out of those seven, claudin-1, an adhesion molecule and phenotypic epithelial marker, is the only independent biomarker of serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Knockdown of claudin-1 expression in ovarian cancer cells reduces LPA-mediated cellular adhesion, enhances suspended cells and reduces LPA-mediated migration. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that transcriptional events mediated by LPA in the tumor microenvironment influence tumor progression through modulation of cell adhesion molecules like claudin-1 and, for the first time, report an LPA-mediated expression signature in ovarian cancer that predicts a worse prognosis."
19466796,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Crystal structures of Cif from bacterial pathogens Photorhabdus luminescens and Burkholderia pseudomallei.,"A pre-requisite for bacterial pathogenesis is the successful interaction of a pathogen with a host. One mechanism used by a broad range of Gram negative bacterial pathogens is to deliver effector proteins directly into host cells through a dedicated type III secretion system where they modulate host cell function. The cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) family of effector proteins, identified in a growing number of pathogens that harbour functional type III secretion systems and have a wide host range, arrest the eukaryotic cell cycle. Here, the crystal structures of Cifs from the insect pathogen/nematode symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens (a gamma-proteobacterium) and human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei (a beta-proteobacterium) are presented. Both of these proteins adopt an overall fold similar to the papain sub-family of cysteine proteases, as originally identified in the structure of a truncated form of Cif from Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), despite sharing only limited sequence identity. The structure of an N-terminal region, referred to here as the 'tail-domain' (absent in the EPEC Cif structure), suggests a surface likely to be involved in host-cell substrate recognition. The conformation of the Cys-His-Gln catalytic triad is retained, and the essential cysteine is exposed to solvent and addressable by small molecule reagents. These structures and biochemical work contribute to the rapidly expanding literature on Cifs, and direct further studies to better understand the molecular details of the activity of these proteins."
19467210,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Amyloid formation by the pro-inflammatory S100A8/A9 proteins in the ageing prostate.,"BACKGROUND: The conversion of soluble peptides and proteins into polymeric amyloid structures is a hallmark of many age-related degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes and a variety of systemic amyloidoses. We report here that amyloid formation is linked to another major age-related phenomenon--prostate tissue remodelling in middle-aged and elderly men. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using multidisciplinary analysis of corpora amylacea inclusions in prostate glands of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer we have revealed that their major components are the amyloid forms of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins associated with numerous inflammatory conditions and types of cancer. In prostate protease rich environment the amyloids are stabilized by dystrophic calcification and lateral thickening. We have demonstrated that material closely resembling CA can be produced from S100A8/A9 in vitro under native and acidic conditions and shows the characters of amyloids. This process is facilitated by calcium or zinc, both of which are abundant in ex vivo inclusions. These observations were supported by computational analysis of the S100A8/A9 calcium-dependent aggregation propensity profiles. We found DNA and proteins from Escherichia coli in CA bodies, suggesting that their formation is likely to be associated with bacterial infection. CA inclusions were also accompanied by the activation of macrophages and by an increase in the concentration of S100A8/A9 in the surrounding tissues, indicating inflammatory reactions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, taken together, suggest a link between bacterial infection, inflammation and amyloid deposition of pro-inflammatory proteins S100A8/A9 in the prostate gland, such that a self-perpetuating cycle can be triggered and may increase the risk of malignancy in the ageing prostate. The results provide strong support for the prediction that the generic ability of polypeptide chains to convert into amyloids could lead to their involvement in an increasing number of otherwise apparently unrelated diseases, particularly those associated with ageing."
19467213,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Misbehaviour of XIST RNA in breast cancer cells.,"A role of X chromosome inactivation process in the development of breast cancer have been suggested. In particular, the relationship between the breast cancer predisposing gene BRCA1 and XIST, the main mediator of X chromosome inactivation, has been intensely investigated, but still remains controversial. We investigated this topic by assessing XIST behaviour in different groups of breast carcinomas and in a panel of breast cancer cell lines both BRCA1 mutant and wild type. In addition, we evaluated the occurrence of broader defects of heterochromatin in relation to BRCA1 status in breast cancer cells. We provide evidence that in breast cancer cells BRCA1 is involved in XIST regulation on the active X chromosome, but not in its localization as previously suggested, and that XIST can be unusually expressed by an active X and can decorate it. This indicates that the detection of XIST cloud in cancer cell is not synonymous of the presence of an inactive X chromosome. Moreover, we show that global heterochromatin defects observed in breast tumor cells are independent of BRCA1 status. Our observations sheds light on a possible previously uncharacterized mechanism of breast carcinogenesis mediated by XIST misbehaviour, particularly in BRCA1-related cancers. Moreover, the significant higher levels of XIST-RNA detected in BRCA1-associated respect to sporadic basal-like cancers, opens the possibility to use XIST expression as a marker to discriminate between the two groups of tumors."
19467333,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,miRNA in the regulation of skeletal muscle adaptation to acute endurance exercise in C57Bl/6J male mice.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNA species involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. In vitro studies have identified a small number of skeletal muscle-specific miRNAs which play a crucial role in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. In skeletal muscle, an acute bout of endurance exercise results in the up-regulation of transcriptional networks that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and skeletal muscle remodelling. The purpose of this study was to assess the expressional profile of targeted miRNA species following an acute bout of endurance exercise and to determine relationships with previously established endurance exercise responsive transcriptional networks. C57Bl/6J wild-type male mice (N = 7/group) were randomly assigned to either sedentary or forced-endurance exercise (treadmill run @ 15 m/min for 90 min) group. The endurance exercise group was sacrificed three hours following a single bout of exercise. The expression of miR- 181, 1, 133, 23, and 107, all of which have been predicted to regulate transcription factors and co-activators involved in the adaptive response to exercise, was measured in quadriceps femoris muscle. Endurance exercise significantly increased the expression of miR-181, miR-1, and miR-107 by 37%, 40%, and 56%, respectively, and reduced miR-23 expression by 84% (P&lt;or=0.05 for all), with no change in miR-133. Importantly, decreased expression of miRNA-23, a putative negative regulator of PGC-1alpha was consistent with increased expression of PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein along with several downstream targets of PGC-1alpha including ALAS, CS, and cytochrome c mRNA. PDK4 protein content remains unaltered despite an increase in its putative negative regulator, miR-107, and PDK4 mRNA expression. mRNA expression of miRNA processing machinery (Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8) remained unchanged. We conclude that miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation is potentially involved in the complex regulatory networks that govern skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance exercise in C57Bl/6J male mice."

In addition, increased LOX expression has been correlated with decreases in both metastases-free, and overall survival in breast cancer patients. With this background, we studied the ability of beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an irreversible inhibitor of LOX, to regulate the metastatic colonization potential of the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. BAPN was administered daily to mice starting either 1 day prior, on the same day as, or 7 days after intracardiac injection of luciferase expressing MDA-MB-231-Luc2 cells. Development of metastases was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging, and tumor-induced osteolysis was assessed by micro-computed tomography (microCT). We found that BAPN administration was able to reduce the frequency of metastases. Thus, when BAPN treatment was initiated the day before, or on the same day as the intra-cardiac injection of tumor cells, the number of metastases was decreased by 44%, and 27%, and whole-body photon emission rates (reflective of total tumor burden) were diminished by 78%, and 45%, respectively. In contrast, BAPN had no effect on the growth of established metastases. Our findings suggest that LOX activity is required during extravasation and/or initial tissue colonization by circulating MDA-MB-231 cells, lending support to the idea that LOX inhibition might be useful in metastasis prevention."
19467336,0,Genes Immun.,100953417,2009,Identification of new SLE-associated genes with a two-step Bayesian study design.,"In our earlier study, we utilized a Bayesian design to probe the association of approximately 1000 genes (approximately 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on a moderate number of trios of parents and children with SLE. Two genes associated with SLE, with a multitest-corrected false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.05, were identified, and a number of noteworthy genes with FDR of &lt;0.8 were also found, pointing out a future direction for the study. In this report, using a large population of controls and adult- or childhood-onset SLE cases, we have extended the earlier investigation to explore the SLE association of 10 of these noteworthy genes (109 SNPs). We have found that seven of these genes exhibit a significant (FDR&lt;0.05) association with SLE, both confirming some genes that have earlier been found to be associated with SLE (PTPN22 and IRF5) and presenting novel findings of genes (KLRG1, interleukin-16, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, toll-like receptor (TLR)8 and CASP10), which have not been reported earlier. The results signify that the two-step candidate pathway design is an efficient way to study the genetic foundations of complex diseases. Furthermore, the novel genes identified in this study point to new directions in both the diagnosis and the eventual treatment of this debilitating disease."

AT9283, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with potent activity against Aurora A and B kinases, inhibited growth and survival of multiple solid tumor cell lines and was efficacious in mouse xenograft models. AT9283-treatment resulted in endoreduplication and ablation of serine-10 histone H3 phosphorylation in both cells and tumor samples, confirming that in these models it acts as an Aurora B kinase inhibitor. In vitro studies demonstrated that exposure to AT9283 for one complete cell cycle committed an entire population of p53 checkpoint-compromised cells (HCT116) to multinucleation and death whereas treatment of p53 checkpoint-competent cells (HMEC, A549) for a similar length of time led to a reversible arrest of cells with 4N DNA. Further studies in synchronized cell populations suggested that exposure to AT9283 during mitosis was critical for optimal cytotoxicity. We therefore investigated ways in which these properties might be exploited to optimize the efficacy and therapeutic index of Aurora kinase inhibitors for p53 checkpoint compromised tumors in vivo. Combining Aurora B kinase inhibition with paclitaxel, which arrests cells in mitosis, in a xenograft model resulted in promising efficacy without additional toxicity. These findings have implications for optimizing the efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitors in clinical practice."

Over the years, many elegant studies employing UV as model mutagen have led to a detailed understanding of how the NER pathway itself is coordinated. Nonetheless relatively little is known regarding any precise functions of various preeminent mutagen-responsive signaling cascades lying upstream of NER, notably those mediated by the canonical MAPKs or the PIKK family members ATR and ATM. Here we present a brief overview of NER, mostly in the context of studies on human cells treated with UV, and describe recent results from our laboratory which have significantly elucidated the role of UV-induced signal transduction in this repair pathway."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Altered interactions within FY/AtCPSF complexes required for Arabidopsis FCA-mediated chromatin silencing.,"The role of RNA metabolism in chromatin silencing is now widely recognized. We have studied the Arabidopsis RNA-binding protein FCA that down-regulates an endogenous floral repressor gene through a chromatin mechanism involving histone demethylase activity. This mechanism needs FCA to interact with an RNA 3' processing/polyadenylation factor (FY/Pfs2p), but the subsequent events leading to chromatin changes are unknown. Here, we show that this FCA-FY interaction is required for general chromatin silencing roles where hairpin transgenes induce DNA methylation of an endogenous gene. We also show 2 conserved RNA processing factors, AtCPSF100 and AtCPSF160, but not FCA, are stably associated with FY in vivo and form a range of different-sized complexes. A hypomorphic fy allele producing a shorter protein, able to provide some FY functions but unable to interact with FCA, reduces abundance of some of the larger MW complexes. Suppressor mutants, which specifically disrupt the FY motif through which FCA interacts, also lacked these larger complexes. Our data support a model whereby FCA, perhaps after recognition of a specific RNA feature, transiently interacts with FY, an integral component of the canonical RNA 3' processing machinery, changing the interactions of the different RNA processing components. These altered interactions would appear to be a necessary step in this RNA-mediated chromatin silencing."

This cross-over has important consequences for elasticity such as an anomalous bulk modulus (K(S)) reduction. At room temperature the anomaly is somewhat sharp in pressure but broadens with increasing temperature. Along a typical geotherm it occurs across most of the lower mantle with a more significant K(S) reduction at approximately 1,400-1,600 km depth. This anomaly might also cause a reduction in the effective activation energy for diffusion creep and lead to a viscosity minimum in the mid-lower mantle, in apparent agreement with results from inversion of data related with mantle convection and postglacial rebound."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Synaptic activation modifies microtubules underlying transport of postsynaptic cargo.,"Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change in strength, requires alterations in synaptic molecule compositions over time, and synapses undergo selective modifications on stimulation. Molecular motors operate in sorting/transport of neuronal proteins; however, the targeting mechanisms that guide and direct cargo delivery remain elusive. We addressed the impact of synaptic transmission on the regulation of intracellular microtubule (MT)-based transport. We show that increased neuronal activity, as induced through GlyR activity blockade, facilitates tubulin polyglutamylation, a posttranslational modification thought to represent a molecular traffic sign for transport. Also, GlyR activity blockade alters the binding of the MT-associated protein MAP2 to MTs. By using the kinesin (KIF5) and the postsynaptic protein gephyrin as models, we show that such changes of MT tracks are accompanied by reduced motor protein mobility and cargo delivery into neurites. Notably, the observed neurite targeting deficits are prevented on functional depletion or gene expression knockdown of neuronal polyglutamylase. Our data suggest a previously undescribed concept of synaptic transmission regulating MT-dependent cargo delivery."
19468996,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,"Geometric considerations in virus capsid size specificity, auxiliary requirements, and buckling.","Spherical capsids are shells of protein subunits that protect the genomes of many viral strains. Although nature displays a range of spherical capsid sizes (reflected by the number of subunits in the formation), specific strains display stringent requirements for forming capsids of specific sizes, a requirement that appears crucial to infectivity. Despite its importance in pathogenicity, little is known regarding the determinants of capsid size. Still less is known about exactly which capsids can undergo maturation events such as buckling transitions--postcapsid-assembly events that are crucial to some virus strains. We show that the exclusive determinant of capsid size is hexamer shape, as defined by subunit-subunit dihedral angles. This conclusion arises from considering the dihedral angle patterns within hexamers belonging to natural canonical capsids and geometric capsid models (deltahedra). From simple geometric models and an understanding of endo angle propagation discussed here, we then suggest that buckling transitions may be available only to capsids of certain size (specifically, T &lt; 7 capsids are precluded from such transformations) and that T &gt; 7 capsids require the help of auxiliary mechanisms for proper capsid formation. These predictions, arising from simple geometry and modeling, are backed by a body of empirical evidence, further reinforcing the extent to which the evolution of the atomistically complex virus capsid may be principled around simple geometric design/requirements."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Characterization of arrangement and expression of the T cell receptor gamma locus in the sandbar shark.,"Ig and T cell receptor (TCR) genes consist of separate genomic elements, which must undergo rearrangement and joining before a functional protein can be expressed. Considerable plasticity in the genomic arrangement of these elements has occurred during the evolution of the immune system. In tetrapods, all Ig and TCR chain elements are arranged as translocons. In teleosts, the Ig heavy and TCR chains are translocons, but light chain genes may occur as clusters. However, in chondrichthyes, all of the Ig light and heavy chain genes are arranged as clusters. These clusters vary in number from &lt;10 to several hundred, depending on isotype and species. Here, we report that the germ-line gene for the TCR gamma chain in a chondrichthyan, the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), is present as a single locus arranged in a classic translocon pattern. Thus, the shark utilizes 2 types of genomic arrangements, the unique cluster organization for Ig genes and the &quot;conventional&quot; translocon organization for TCR genes. The TCR gamma translocon contains at least 5 V region genes, 3 J segment genes, and 1 C segment. As expected, the third hypervariable segment (CDR3), formed by the rearrangement of the Vgamma and Jgamma segments, contributed the major variability in the intact V region structure. Our data also suggest that diversity may be generated by mutation in the V regions."
19469000,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Preserving information in neural transmission.,"Along most neural pathways, the spike trains transmitted from one neuron to the next are altered. In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for &gt;85% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina."
19469002,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,The mammalian molecular clockwork controls rhythmic expression of its own input pathway components.,"The core molecular clockwork in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is based on autoregulatory feedback loops of transcriptional activators (CLOCK/NPAS2 and BMAL1) and inhibitors (mPER1-2 and mCRY1-2). To synchronize the phase of the molecular clockwork to the environmental day and night condition, light at dusk and dawn increases mPer expression. However, the signal transduction pathways differ remarkably between the day/night and the night/day transition. Light during early night leads to intracellular Ca(2+) release by neuronal ryanodine receptors (RyRs), resulting in phase delays. Light during late night triggers an increase in guanylyl cyclase activity, resulting in phase advances. To date, it is still unknown how the core molecular clockwork regulates the availability of the respective input pathway components. Therefore, we examined light resetting mechanisms in mice with an impaired molecular clockwork (BMAL1(-/-)) and the corresponding wild type (BMAL1(+/+)) using in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and a luciferase reporter system. In addition, intracellular calcium concentrations (Ca(2+)(i)) were measured in SCN slices using two-photon microscopy. In the SCN of BMAL1(-/-) mice Ryr mRNA and RyR protein levels were reduced, and light-induced mPer expression was selectively impaired during early night. Transcription assays with NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed that Ryr expression was activated by CLOCK::BMAL1 and inhibited by mCRY1. The Ca(2+)(i) response of SCN cells to the RyR agonist caffeine was reduced in BMAL1(-/-) compared with BMAL1(+/+) mice. Our findings provide the first evidence that the mammalian molecular clockwork influences Ryr expression and thus controls its own photic input pathway components."
19469003,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Senescence-induced serotonin biosynthesis and its role in delaying senescence in rice leaves.,"Serotonin, which is well known as a pineal hormone in mammals, plays a key role in conditions such as mood, eating disorders, and alcoholism. In plants, although serotonin has been suggested to be involved in several physiological roles, including flowering, morphogenesis, and adaptation to environmental changes, its regulation and functional roles are as yet not characterized at the molecular level. In this study, we found that serotonin is greatly accumulated in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves undergoing senescence induced by either nutrient deprivation or detachment, and its synthesis is closely coupled with transcriptional and enzymatic induction of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes as well as tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Transgenic rice plants that overexpressed TDC accumulated higher levels of serotonin than the wild type and showed delayed senescence of rice leaves. However, transgenic rice plants, in which expression of TDC was suppressed through an RNA interference (RNAi) system, produced less serotonin and senesced faster than the wild type, suggesting that serotonin is involved in attenuating leaf senescence. The senescence-retarding activity of serotonin is associated with its high antioxidant activity compared to either tryptophan or chlorogenic acid. Results of TDC overexpression and TDC RNAi plants suggest that TDC plays a rate-limiting role for serotonin accumulation, but the synthesis of serotonin depends on an absolute amount of tryptophan accumulation by the coordinate induction of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes. In addition, immunolocalization analysis revealed that serotonin was abundant in the vascular parenchyma cells, including companion cells and xylem-parenchyma cells, suggestive of its involvement in maintaining the cellular integrity of these cells for facilitating efficient nutrient recycling from senescing leaves to sink tissues during senescence."

Virol.,113724,2009,"Features distinguishing Epstein-Barr virus infections of epithelial cells and B cells: viral genome expression, genome maintenance, and genome amplification.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with malignant diseases of lymphoid and epithelial cell origin. The tropism of EBV is due to B-cell-restricted expression of CD21, the major receptor molecule for the virus. However, efficient infection of CD21- epithelial cells can be achieved via transfer from EBV-coated B cells. We compare and contrast here the early events following in vitro infection of primary B cells and epithelial cells. Using sensitive, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays for several latent and lytic transcripts and two-color immunofluorescence staining to analyze expression at the single cell level, we confirmed and extended previous reports indicating that the two cell types support different patterns of transcription. Furthermore, whereas infection of B cells with one or two copies of EBV resulted in rapid amplification of the viral genome to &gt;20 copies per cell, such amplification was not normally observed after infection of primary epithelial cells or undifferentiated epithelial lines. In epithelial cells, EBNA1 expression was detected in only ca. 40% of EBER+ cells, and the EBV genome was subsequently lost during prolonged culture. One exception was that infection of AGS, a gastric carcinoma line, resulted in maintenance of EBNA1 expression and amplification of the EBV episome. In contrast to B cells, where amplification of the EBV episome occurred even with a replication-defective BZLF1-knockout virus, amplification in AGS cells was dependent upon early lytic cycle gene expression. These data highlight the influence of the host cell on the outcome of EBV infection with regard to genome expression, amplification, and maintenance."

Virol.,113724,2009,Coronavirus genetically redirected to the epidermal growth factor receptor exhibits effective antitumor activity against a malignant glioblastoma.,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with features attractive for oncolytic therapy. To investigate this potential, we redirected the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is normally unable to infect human cells, to human tumor cells by using a soluble receptor (soR)-based expression construct fused to an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor targeting moiety. Addition of this adapter protein to MHV allowed infection of otherwise nonsusceptible, EGF receptor (EGFR)-expressing cell cultures. We introduced the sequence encoding the adaptor protein soR-EGF into the MHV genome to generate a self-targeted virus capable of multiround infection. The resulting recombinant MHV was viable and had indeed acquired the ability to infect all glioblastoma cell lines tested in vitro. Infection of malignant human glioblastoma U87DeltaEGFR cells gave rise to release of progeny virus and efficient cell killing in vitro. To investigate the oncolytic capacity of the virus in vivo, we used an orthotopic U87DeltaEGFR xenograft mouse model. Treatment of mice bearing a lethal intracranial U87DeltaEGFR tumor by injection with MHVsoR-EGF significantly prolonged survival compared to phosphate-buffered saline-treated (P = 0.001) and control virus-treated (P = 0.004) animals, and no recurrent tumor load was observed. However, some adverse effects were seen in normal mouse brain tissues that were likely caused by the natural murine tropism of MHV. This is the first demonstration of oncolytic activity of a coronavirus in vivo. It suggests that nonhuman coronaviruses may be attractive new therapeutic agents against human tumors."
19469576,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Chromosome conformation capture of all 13 genomic Loci in the transcriptional regulation of the multisubunit bigenomic cytochrome C oxidase in neurons.,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain composed of 13 subunits; three are mitochondria-encoded, and 10 are nucleus-inscribed on nine different chromosomes within the mammalian genome. The transcriptional regulation of such a multisubunit, multichromosomal, and bigenomic enzyme is mechanistically challenging. Transcription factories have been proposed as one mechanism by which genes from different genomic loci congregate to transcribe functionally related genes, and chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a means by which such interactions can be revealed. Thus far, however, only loci from the same chromosome or at most two chromosomes have been co-localized by 3C. The present study used 3C to test our hypothesis that not only the 10 genomic loci from nine chromosomes encoding the 10 nuclear subunits of COX, but also genes from three chromosomes encoding mitochondrial transcription factors A and B (Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m) critical for the transcription of the three mitochondria-encoded COX subunit genes all occupy common intranuclear sites in the murine neuronal nuclei. The pairing of various COX subunit genes and Tf genes indicates that interactions are present among all of them. On the other hand, genes for a non-mitochondrial protein (calreticulin) as well as a mitochondrial enzyme (citrate synthase) did not interact with COX genes. Furthermore, interactions between COX subunit and Tf genes were up-regulated by depolarizing stimulation and down-regulated by impulse blockade in primary neurons. Thus, a viable mechanism is in place for a synchronized, coordinated transcriptional regulation of this multisubunit, bigenomic COX enzyme in neurons."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Cardiotrophin-1 maintains the undifferentiated state in skeletal myoblasts.,"Skeletal myogenesis is potently regulated by the extracellular milieu of growth factors and cytokines. We observed that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. The normal up-regulation of myogenic marker genes, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), and myocyte enhancer factor 2s (MEF2s) were inhibited by CT-1 treatment. CT-1 also represses myogenin (MyoG) promoter activation. CT-1 activated two signaling pathways: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), a component of the extracellular signal-regulated MAPK (ERK) pathway. In view of the known connection between CT-1 and STAT3 activation, we surprisingly found that pharmacological blockade of STAT3 activity had no effect on the inhibition of myogenesis by CT-1 suggesting that STAT3 signaling is dispensable for myogenic repression. Conversely, MEK inhibition potently reversed the inhibition of myotube formation and attenuated the repression of MRF transcriptional activity mediated by CT-1. Taken together, these data indicate that CT-1 represses skeletal myogenesis through interference with MRF activity by activation of MEK/ERK signaling. In agreement with these in vitro observations, exogenous systemic expression of CT-1 mediated by adenoviral vector delivery increased the number of myonuclei in normal post-natal mouse skeletal muscle and also delayed skeletal muscle regeneration induced by cardiotoxin injection. The expression pattern of CT-1 in embryonic and post-natal skeletal muscle and in vivo effects of CT-1 on myogenesis implicate CT-1 in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in muscle progenitor cells."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Rpb9 subunit controls transcription fidelity by delaying NTP sequestration in RNA polymerase II.,"Rpb9 is a small non-essential subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II located on the surface on the enzyme. Deletion of the RPB9 gene shows synthetic lethality with the low fidelity rpb1-E1103G mutation localized in the trigger loop, a mobile element of the catalytic Rpb1 subunit, which has been shown to control transcription fidelity. Similar to the rpb1-E1103G mutation, the RPB9 deletion substantially enhances NTP misincorporation and increases the rate of mismatch extension with the next cognate NTP in vitro. Using pre-steady state kinetic analysis, we show that RPB9 deletion promotes sequestration of NTPs in the polymerase active center just prior to the phosphodiester bond formation. We propose a model in which the Rpb9 subunit controls transcription fidelity by delaying the closure of the trigger loop on the incoming NTP via interaction between the C-terminal domain of Rpb9 and the trigger loop. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulation of transcription fidelity by protein factors located at a large distance from the active center of RNA polymerase II."

However, there is a paucity of information concerning the regulatory mechanism of miRNA expression. Here we report identification of growth factor-regulated miRNAs using the PC12 cell line, an established model of neuronal growth and differentiation. We found that expression of miR-221 and miR-222 expression were induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation in PC12 cells, and that this induction was dependent on sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Using a target prediction program, we also identified a pro-apototic factor, the BH3-only protein Bim, as a potential target of miR-221/222. Overexpression of miR-221 or miR-222 suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter activity fused to the 3' UTR of Bim mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-221/222 decreased endogenous Bim mRNA expression. These results reveal that the ERK signal regulates miR-221/222 expression, and that these miRNAs might contribute to NGF-dependent cell survival in PC12 cells."

Glycophorin A (GPA) is a sialoglycoprotein that associates with AE1 in erythrocytes forming the Wrb (Wright b) blood group antigen. These two integral proteins may also form a complex during biosynthesis, with GPA facilitating the cell surface expression of AE1. This study investigates the interaction of GPA with AE1 in K562 cells, a human erythroleukaemic cell line that expresses GPA, and the role of GPA in the cell surface expression of AE1. In K562 cells, GPA was dimeric and N- and O-glycosylated similar to erythroid GPA. GPA was localized at the cell surface, but also localized to the Golgi. AE1 expressed in K562 cells contained both complex and high-mannose oligosaccharides, and co-localized with GPA at the cell surface and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Wrb antigen was detected at the cell surface of AE1-transfected K562 cells, indicating the existence of an AE1-GPA complex. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies using AE1 and an ER-localized hereditary spherocytosis mutant (R760Q AE1) showed that GPA and AE1 could interact in the ER. GPA knockdown by shRNAs (small-hairpin RNAs), however, had no effect on the level of cell surface expression of AE1. The results indicate that AE1 and GPA form a complex in the ER of human K562 cells, but that both proteins can also traffic to the cell surface independently of each other."

Grb14 is localized predominantly to the inner segment, nuclear layer, and synapse in dark-adapted rods, whereas in the light-adapted rods, Grb14 redistributed throughout the entire cell, including the outer segment. The translocation of Grb14 requires photoactivation of rhodopsin, but not signaling through the phototransduction cascade, and is not based on direct Grb14-rhodopsin interactions. We previously hypothesized that Grb14 protects light-dependent insulin receptor (IR) activation in rod photoreceptors against dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. Consistent with this hypothesis, we failed to observe light-dependent IR activation in Grb14(-/-) mouse retinas. Our studies suggest that Grb14 translocates to photoreceptor outer segments after photobleaching of rhodopsin and protects IR phosphorylation in rod photoreceptor cells. These results demonstrate that Grb14 can undergo subcellular redistribution upon illumination and suggest that rhodopsin photoexcitation may trigger signaling events alternative to the classical transducin activation."
19470583,1,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,BOWiki: an ontology-based wiki for annotation of data and integration of knowledge in biology.,"MOTIVATION: Ontology development and the annotation of biological data using ontologies are time-consuming exercises that currently require input from expert curators. Open, collaborative platforms for biological data annotation enable the wider scientific community to become involved in developing and maintaining such resources. However, this openness raises concerns regarding the quality and correctness of the information added to these knowledge bases. The combination of a collaborative web-based platform with logic-based approaches and Semantic Web technology can be used to address some of these challenges and concerns. RESULTS: We have developed the BOWiki, a web-based system that includes a biological core ontology. The core ontology provides background knowledge about biological types and relations. Against this background, an automated reasoner assesses the consistency of new information added to the knowledge base. The system provides a platform for research communities to integrate information and annotate data collaboratively.

Gastrointestinal schwannomas are often incidentally discovered as small polypoid intraluminal lesions. In this report, we describe the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of a distinctive neural mucosal polyp composed of a diffuse cellular proliferation of uniform bland spindled cells in the lamina propria that entraps the colonic crypts. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong and diffuse positivity for the S-100 protein. To avoid confusion of these solitary colorectal polyps containing pure spindled Schwann cell proliferation in the lamina propria with neural lesions that have significant association with inherited syndromes, it is better to use the designation &quot;mucosal Schwann hamartoma&quot;."
19470658,0,World J. Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,Estimating glomerular filtration rate preoperatively for patients undergoing hepatectomy.,"AIM: To compare creatinine clearance (Ccr) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in preoperative renal function tests in patients undergoing hepatectomy. METHODS: The records of 197 patients undergoing hepatectomy between August 2006 and August 2008 were studied, and preoperative Ccr, a three-variable equation for eGFR (eGFR3) and a five-variable equation for eGFR (eGFR5) were calculated. Abnormal values were defined as Ccr &lt; 50 mL/min, eGFR3 and eGFR5 &lt; 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). The maximum increases in the postoperative serum creatinine (post Cr) level and postoperative rate of increase in the serum Cr level (post Cr rate) were compared. RESULTS: There were 37 patients (18.8%) with abnormal Ccr, 31 (15.7%) with abnormal eGFR3, and 40 (20.3%) with abnormal eGFR5. Although there were no significant differences in the post Cr rate between patients with normal and abnormal Ccr, eGFR3 and eGFR5 values, the post Cr level was significantly higher in patients with eGFR3 and eGFR5 abnormality than in normal patients (P &lt; 0.0001). Post Cr level tended to be higher in patients with Ccr abnormality (P = 0.0936 and P = 0.0875, respectively). CONCLUSION: eGFR5 and the simpler eGFR3, rather than Ccr, are recommended as a preoperative renal function test in patients undergoing hepatectomy."
19470753,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Abberant alpha-synuclein confers toxicity to neurons in part through inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms through which aberrant alpha-synuclein (ASYN) leads to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) are uncertain. In isolated liver lysosomes, mutant ASYNs impair Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), a targeted lysosomal degradation pathway; however, whether this occurs in a cellular context, and whether it mediates ASYN toxicity, is unknown. We have investigated presently the effects of WT or mutant ASYN on the lysosomal pathways of CMA and macroautophagy in neuronal cells and assessed their impact on ASYN-mediated toxicity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Novel inducible SH-SY5Y and PC12 cell lines expressing human WT and A53T ASYN, as well as two mutant forms that lack the CMA-targeting motif were generated. Such forms were also expressed in primary cortical neurons, using adenoviral transduction. In each case, effects on long-lived protein degradation, LC3 II levels (as a macroautophagy index), and cell death and survival were assessed. In both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cycling cells, induction of A53T ASYN evoked a significant decrease in lysosomal degradation, largely due to CMA impairment. In neuronally differentiated SH-SH5Y cells, both WT and A53T ASYN induction resulted in gradual toxicity, which was partly dependent on CMA impairment and compensatory macroautophagy induction. In primary neurons both WT and A53T ASYN were toxic, but only in the case of A53T ASYN did CMA dysfunction and compensatory macroautophagy induction occur and participate in death. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of mutant A53T, and, in some cases, WT ASYN in neuronal cells leads to CMA dysfunction, and this in turn leads to compensatory induction of macroautophagy. Inhibition of these lysosomal effects mitigates ASYN toxicity. Therefore, CMA dysfunction mediates aberrant ASYN toxicity, and may be a target for therapeutic intervention in PD and related disorders. Furthermore, macroautophagy induction in the context of ASYN over-expression, in contrast to other settings, appears to be a detrimental response, leading to neuronal death."
19470756,1,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Regulation of ErbB2 receptor status by the proteasomal DUB POH1.,"Understanding the factors, which control ErbB2 and EGF receptor (EGFR) status in cells is likely to inform future therapeutic approaches directed at these potent oncogenes. ErbB2 is resistant to stimulus-induced degradation and high levels of over-expression can inhibit EGF receptor down-regulation. We now show that for HeLa cells expressing similar numbers of EGFR and ErbB2, EGFR down-regulation is efficient and insensitive to reduction of ErbB2 levels. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) may extend protein half-lives by rescuing ubiquitinated substrates from proteasomal degradation or from ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal sorting. Using a siRNA library directed at the full complement of human DUBs, we identified POH1 (also known as Rpn11 or PSMD14), a component of the proteasome lid, as a critical DUB controlling the apparent ErbB2 levels. Moreover, the effects on ErbB2 levels can be reproduced by administration of proteasomal inhibitors such as epoxomicin used at maximally tolerated doses. However, the extent of this apparent loss and specificity for ErbB2 versus EGFR could not be accounted for by changes in transcription or degradation rate. Further investigation revealed that cell surface ErbB2 levels are only mildly affected by POH1 knock-down and that the apparent loss can at least partially be explained by the accumulation of higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of ErbB2 that are detectable with an extracellular but not intracellular domain directed antibody. We propose that POH1 may deubiquitinate ErbB2 and that this activity is not necessarily coupled to proteasomal degradation."
19470758,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,On the origin of Indonesian cattle.,"BACKGROUND: Two bovine species contribute to the Indonesian livestock, zebu (Bos indicus) and banteng (Bos javanicus), respectively. Although male hybrid offspring of these species is not fertile, Indonesian cattle breeds are supposed to be of mixed species origin. However, this has not been documented and is so far only supported by preliminary molecular analysis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Analysis of mitochondrial, Y-chromosomal and microsatellite DNA showed a banteng introgression of 10-16% in Indonesian zebu breeds. East-Javanese Madura and Galekan cattle have higher levels of autosomal banteng introgression (20-30%) and combine a zebu paternal lineage with a predominant (Madura) or even complete (Galekan) maternal banteng origin. Two Madura bulls carried taurine Y-chromosomal haplotypes, presumably of French Limousin origin. In contrast, we did not find evidence for zebu introgression in five populations of the Bali cattle, a domestic form of the banteng. CONCLUSIONS: Because of their unique species composition Indonesian cattle represent a valuable genetic resource, which potentially may also be exploited in other tropical regions."
19470771,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Incidence and prediction of falls in dementia: a prospective study in older people.,"BACKGROUND: Falls are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dementia, but there have been no prospective studies of risk factors for falling specific to this patient population, and no successful falls intervention/prevention trials. This prospective study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for falling in older people with mild to moderate dementia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 179 participants aged over 65 years were recruited from outpatient clinics in the UK (38 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 32 Vascular dementia (VAD), 30 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 40 Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), 39 healthy controls). A multifactorial assessment of baseline risk factors was performed and fall diaries were completed prospectively for 12 months. Dementia participants experienced nearly 8 times more incident falls (9118/1000 person-years) than controls (1023/1000 person-years; incidence density ratio: 7.58, 3.11-18.5). In dementia, significant univariate predictors of sustaining at least one fall included diagnosis of Lewy body disorder (proportional hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age and sex: 3.33, 2.11-5.26), and history of falls in the preceding 12 months (HR: 2.52, 1.52-4.17). In multivariate analyses, significant potentially modifiable predictors were symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (HR: 2.13, 1.19-3.80), autonomic symptom score (HR per point 0-36: 1.055, 1.012-1.099), and Cornell depression score (HR per point 0-40: 1.053, 1.01-1.099). Higher levels of physical activity were protective (HR per point 0-9: 0.827, 0.716-0.956). CONCLUSIONS: The management of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, autonomic symptoms and depression, and the encouragement of physical activity may provide the core elements for the most fruitful strategy to reduce falls in people with dementia. Randomised controlled trials to assess such a strategy are a priority."
19471097,0,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Natural killer T cells activated by a lipopeptidophosphoglycan from Entamoeba histolytica are critically important to control amebic liver abscess.,"The innate immune response is supposed to play an essential role in the control of amebic liver abscess (ALA), a severe form of invasive amoebiasis due to infection with the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. In a mouse model for the disease, we previously demonstrated that Jalpha18(-/-) mice, lacking invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, suffer from more severe abscess development. Here we show that the specific activation of iNKT cells using alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) induces a significant reduction in the sizes of ALA lesions, whereas CD1d(-/-) mice develop more severe abscesses. We identified a lipopeptidophosphoglycan from E. histolytica membranes (EhLPPG) as a possible natural NKT cell ligand and show that the purified phosphoinositol (PI) moiety of this molecule induces protective IFN-gamma but not IL-4 production in NKT cells. The main component of EhLPPG responsible for NKT cell activation is a diacylated PI, (1-O-[(28:0)-lyso-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-]2-O-(C16:0)-Ins). IFN-gamma production by NKT cells requires the presence of CD1d and simultaneously TLR receptor signalling through MyD88 and secretion of IL-12. Similar to alpha-GalCer application, EhLPPG treatment significantly reduces the severity of ALA in ameba-infected mice. Our results suggest that EhLPPG is an amebic molecule that is important for the limitation of ALA development and may explain why the majority of E. histolytica-infected individuals do not develop amebic liver abscess."
19471100,0,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,"Treatment in advanced colorectal cancer: what, when and how?","Treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) increasingly requires a multidisciplinary approach and multiple treatment options add to the complexity of clinical decision-making. Recently novel targeted therapy against angiogenesis and epidermal growth factor receptor completed a plethora of phase III studies. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improved the efficacy over chemotherapy alone in both first and second line settings, although the magnitude of benefit may not be as great when a more optimal chemotherapy platform is used. Studies performed thus far did not address conclusively whether bevacizumab should be continued in subsequent lines of treatment. Anti-angiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors have not shown any additional benefit over chemotherapy alone so far. Although some benefits were seen with cetuximab in all settings of treating advanced CRC, K-ras mutation status provides an important determinant of who would not benefit from such a treatment. Caution should be exercised in combining anti-angiogenesis with anti-EGFR strategy until further randomised data become available. In this review, we have focused on the implications of these trial results on the everyday management decisions of treating advanced CRC."

Cancer,370635,2009,"A prospective Swedish study on body size, body composition, diabetes, and prostate cancer risk.","Obesity may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa). According to one hypothesis, obesity could lower the risk of non-aggressive tumours, while simultaneously increasing the risk of aggressive cancer. Furthermore, central adiposity may be independently associated with PCa risk; it is also associated with diabetes, which itself may influence risk of PCa. We studied the associations between height, body composition, and fat distribution, diabetes prevalence and risk of total, aggressive, and non-aggressive PCa in 10,564 initially cancer-free men (aged 45-73 years) of the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort. Anthropometric and body composition measurements, including bioelectrical impedance for estimation of fat mass, were performed by study nurses. Diabetes prevalence was self-reported. Cancer cases and clinical characteristics were ascertained through national and regional registry data. Dietary and other background data were obtained through a modified diet history method and an extensive questionnaire. During a mean follow-up of 11.0 years, 817 incidental PCa cases were diagnosed. Of these, 281 were classified as aggressive. There were 202 cases occurring before 65 years of age. Height was positively associated with total and non-aggressive PCa risk. Waist-hip ratio (WHR), a measure of central adiposity, was positively associated with PCa before age 65, and less strongly, with total PCa. This association was independent of body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders. General adiposity, expressed as BMI or body fat percentage, and prevalent diabetes were not associated with PCa risk. In this study, WHR and body height were stronger PCa predictors than general adiposity."
19471109,0,Br. J. Cancer,370635,2009,Ovulation-stimulation drugs and cancer risks: a long-term follow-up of a British cohort.,"To assess long-term health effects of ovarian-stimulation drugs we followed-up for over 20 years a British cohort of 7355 women with ovulatory disorders, 43% of whom were prescribed ovarian-stimulation drugs, and identified a total of 274 deaths and 367 incident cancers. Relative to the general population, the cohort experienced lower mortality from most causes, including from all neoplasms combined, and lower incidence of cervical cancer, but higher incidence of cancers of the breast (relative risk: 1.13; 95% CI 0.97, 1.30) and corpus uteri (2.02; 1.37, 2.87). There were, however, no significant differences in the risk of cancers of the breast, corpus uteri, ovary, or of any other site, between women who had been prescribed ovarian-stimulation drugs and those who had not. Further analyses by type of drug and dose revealed a dose-response gradient in the risk of cancer of the corpus uteri (P for linear trend=0.03), with women given &gt;or=2250 mg of clomiphene having a 2.6-fold (2.62; 0.94, 6.82) increase in risk relative to those who were not treated. These findings do not support strong associations between ovulation-stimulation drugs and cancer risks, but they indicate the need for continued monitoring to establish whether risks are elevated in certain subgroups of users."
19471271,0,Cell Res.,9425763,2009,Histone acetyltransferase GCN5 interferes with the miRNA pathway in Arabidopsis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) that guide sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing play an important role in gene expression required for both developmental processes and responses to environmental conditions in plants. However, little is known about the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA expression. Histone acetylation plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and is required for gene activation. By analyzing the accumulation of subset of miRNAs and the corresponding primary miRNAs in mutants of Arabidopsis, we show that histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (General control non-repressed protein5) has a general repressive effect on miRNA production, while it is required for the expression of a subset of (e.g. stress-inducible) MIRNA genes. The general negative function of GCN5 in miRNA production is likely achieved through an indirect repression of the miRNA machinery genes such as DICER LIKE1 (DCL1), SERRATE (SE), HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) and ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GCN5 targets to a subset of MIRNA genes and is required for acetylation of histone H3 lysine 14 at these loci. Moreover, inhibition of histone deacetylation by trichostatin A treatment or in histone deacetylase gene mutants impaired the accumulation of certain miRNAs. These data together suggest that Arabidopsis GCN5 interferes with the miRNA pathway at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and histone acetylation/deacetylation is an epigenetic mechanism involved in the regulation of miRNA production."
19472338,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV links group I metabotropic glutamate receptors to fragile X mental retardation protein in cingulate cortex.,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) due to silencing of the FMR1 gene. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the central nervous system contribute to higher brain functions including learning/memory, persistent pain, and mental disorders. Our recent study has shown that activation of Group I mGluR up-regulated FMRP in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region for brain cognitive and executive functions; Ca(2+) signaling pathways could be involved in the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs. In this study we demonstrate that stimulating Group I mGluRs activates Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in ACC neurons. In ACC neurons of adult mice overexpressing CaMKIV, the up-regulation of FMRP by stimulating Group I mGluR is enhanced. The enhancement occurs at the transcriptional level as the Fmr1 mRNA level was further elevated compared with wild-type mice. Using pharmacological approaches, we found that inhibition of CaMKIV could attenuate the up-regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs. CaMKIV contribute to the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs probably through cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) activation, as manipulation of CaMKIV could simultaneously cause the change of CREB phosphorylation induced by Group I mGluR activation. Our study has provided strong evidence for CaMKIV as a molecular link between Group I mGluRs and FMRP in ACC neurons and may help us to elucidate the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome."
19472344,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Methylation of TFPI2 in stool DNA: a potential novel biomarker for the detection of colorectal cancer.,"We have used a gene expression array-based strategy to identify the methylation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), a potential tumor suppressor gene, as a frequent event in human colorectal cancers (CRC). TFPI2 belongs to the recently described group of embryonic cell Polycomb group (PcG)-marked genes that may be predisposed to aberrant DNA methylation in early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. Aberrant methylation of TFPI2 was detected in almost all CRC adenomas (97%, n = 56) and stages I to IV CRCs (99%, n = 115). We further explored the potential of TFPI2 as a biomarker for the early detection of CRC using stool DNA-based assays in patients with nonmetastatic CRC and average-risk noncancer controls who were candidates for screening. TFPI2 methylation was detected in stool DNA from stage I to III CRC patients with a sensitivity of 76% to 89% and a specificity of 79% to 93%. Detection of TFPI2 methylation in stool DNA may act as a useful adjunct to the noninvasive strategies for screening of CRCs in the future."
19472362,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,Comparison of primary neuroblastoma tumors and derivative early-passage cell lines using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis.,"Stromal contamination is one of the major confounding factors in the analysis of solid tumor samples by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. As we propose to use genome-wide SNP microarray analysis as a diagnostic platform for neuroblastoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these studies must be optimized. To investigate the effects of stromal contamination, we derived early-passage cell lines from nine primary tumors and compared their genomic signature with that of the primary tumors using 100K SNP arrays. The average concordance between tumor and cell line for raw loss of heterozygosity (LOH) calls was 96% (range, 91-99%) and for raw copy number alterations, 71% (range, 43-87%). In general, there were a larger number of LOH events identified in the cell lines compared with the matched tumor samples (mean increase, 3.2% +/- 1.9%). We have developed an algorithm that shows that the presence of stroma contributes to under-reporting of LOH and copy number loss. Notable findings in this sample set were uniparental disomy of chromosome arms 11p, 1q, 14q, and 15q and a novel area of amplification on chromosome band 11p15. Our analysis shows that LOH was identified significantly more often in derived cell lines compared with the original tumor samples. Although these may in part be due to clonal selection during adaptation to tissue culture, our study indicates that stromal contamination may be a major contributing factor in underestimation of LOH and copy number loss events."

We report that these non-tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells are characterized by a molecular program associated with hallmarks of &quot;division arrest anergy.&quot; Non-tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells are characterized by coexpression of CD7, CD25, and CD69 as well as elevated levels of lck(p505) and p27(kip1).

The Prp19 complex [nineteen complex (NTC)] can specify U5 and U6 snRNA interactions with pre-mRNA during spliceosome activation. A candidate for linking the NTC to the snRNAs is the NTC protein Cwc2, which contains motifs known to bind RNA, a zinc finger and RNA recognition motif (RRM). In yeast cells mutation of either the zinc finger or RRM destabilize Cwc2 and are lethal. Yeast cells depleted of Cwc2 accumulate pre-mRNA and display reduced levels of U1, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs. Cwc2 depletion also reduces U4/U6 snRNA complex levels, as found with depletion of other NTC proteins, but without increase in free U4. Purified Cwc2 displays general RNA binding properties and can bind both snRNAs and pre-mRNA in vitro. A Cwc2 RRM fragment alone can bind RNA but with reduced efficiency. Under splicing conditions Cwc2 can associate with U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs, but can only be crosslinked directly to the U6 snRNA. Cwc2 associates with U6 both before and after the first step of splicing. We propose that Cwc2 links the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing through the U6 snRNA."

Through population-scale comparative genomics of 7 Sulfolobus islandicus genomes from 3 locations, we demonstrate the biogeographical structure of the pan-genome of this species, with no evidence of gene flow between geographically isolated populations. The evolutionary independence of each population allowed us to assess genome dynamics over very recent evolutionary time, beginning approximately 910,000 years ago. On this time scale, genome variation largely consists of recent strain-specific integration of mobile elements. Localized sectors of parallel gene loss are identified; however, the balance between the gain and loss of genetic material suggests that S. islandicus genomes acquire material slowly over time, primarily from closely related Sulfolobus species. Examination of the genome dynamics through population genomics in S. islandicus exposes the process of allopatric speciation in thermophilic Archaea and brings us closer to a generalized framework for understanding microbial genome evolution in a spatial context."

The US3 protein of different alphaherpesviruses causes dramatic alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, such as the disassembly of actin stress fibers and formation of cell projections, which have been associated with increased intercellular virus spread. Here, we find that inhibiting group A p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are key regulators in Cdc42/Rac1 Rho GTPase signaling pathways, impairs US3-mediated actin alterations. By using PAK1(-/-) and PAK2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), we show that US3-mediated stress fiber disassembly requires PAK2, whereas US3-mediated cell projection formation mainly is mediated by PAK1, also indicating that PAK1 and PAK2 can have different biological effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, US3 was found to bind and phosphorylate group A PAKs. Lack of group A PAKs in MEFs was correlated with inefficient virus spread. Thus, US3 induces its effect on the actin cytoskeleton via group A PAKs."

Sci.,52457,2009,Cajal-body formation correlates with differential coilin phosphorylation in primary and transformed cell lines.,"Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear structures that are thought to have diverse functions, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. The phosphorylation status of coilin, the CB marker protein, might impact CB formation. We hypothesize that primary cells, which lack CBs, contain different phosphoisoforms of coilin compared with that found in transformed cells, which have CBs. Localization, self-association and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on coilin phosphomutants all suggest this modification impacts the function of coilin and may thus contribute towards CB formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that coilin is hyperphosphorylated in primary cells compared with transformed cells. mRNA levels of the nuclear phosphatase PPM1G are significantly reduced in primary cells and expression of PPM1G in primary cells induces CBs. Additionally, PPM1G can dephosphorylate coilin in vitro. Surprisingly, however, expression of green fluorescent protein alone is sufficient to form CBs in primary cells. Taken together, our data support a model whereby coilin is the target of an uncharacterized signal transduction cascade that responds to the increased transcription and snRNP demands found in transformed cells."

Progeny hybrid viruses displayed in vitro cell line tropism of CPXV-NOH1, but not that of MVA. The HA transgene or its expression was lost on serial passage of transgenic viruses and the speed at which HA expression was lost varied with cell lines. The HA transgene in the progeny viruses or its expression was stable in African Green Monkey derived Vero cells but became unstable in rat derived IEC-6 cells. Hybrid viruses lacking the HA transgene have higher levels of virus multiplication in mammalian cell lines and produced more enveloped virions than the transgene positive progenitor virus strain. Analysis of the subcellular localization of the transgenic HA protein showed that neither virus strain nor cell line have effect on the subcellular targets of the HA protein. The influenza virus HA protein was targeted to enveloped virions, plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that homologous recombination between poxvirus-vectored vaccine and naturally circulating poxviruses, genetic instability of the transgene, accumulation of non-transgene expressing vectors or hybrid virus progenies, as well as cell line/type specific selection against the transgene are potential complications that may result if poxvirus vectored vaccines are extensively used in animals and man."
19474100,0,BMC Genomics,100965258,2009,Sequencing and de novo analysis of a coral larval transcriptome using 454 GSFlx.,"BACKGROUND: New methods are needed for genomic-scale analysis of emerging model organisms that exemplify important biological questions but lack fully sequenced genomes. For example, there is an urgent need to understand the potential for corals to adapt to climate change, but few molecular resources are available for studying these processes in reef-building corals. To facilitate genomics studies in corals and other non-model systems, we describe methods for transcriptome sequencing using 454, as well as strategies for assembling a useful catalog of genes from the output. We have applied these methods to sequence the transcriptome of planulae larvae from the coral Acropora millepora. RESULTS: More than 600,000 reads produced in a single 454 sequencing run were assembled into approximately 40,000 contigs with five-fold average sequencing coverage. Based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified approximately 11,000 different genes expressed in a range of conditions including thermal stress and settlement induction. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene names, conserved domains, and Gene Ontology terms. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes associated with essential metabolic pathways and conserved signaling pathways, as well as novel candidate genes for stress-related processes. Comparisons with the genome of the anemone Nematostella vectensis revealed approximately 8,500 pairs of orthologs and approximately 100 candidate coral-specific genes. More than 30,000 SNPs were detected in the coral sequences, and a subset of these validated by re-sequencing. CONCLUSION: The methods described here for deep sequencing of the transcriptome should be widely applicable to generate catalogs of genes and genetic markers in emerging model organisms. Our data provide the most comprehensive sequence resource currently available for reef-building corals, and include an extensive collection of potential genetic markers for association and population connectivity studies. The characterization of the larval transcriptome for this widely-studied coral will enable research into the biological processes underlying stress responses in corals and evolutionary adaptation to global climate change."
19474108,0,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2009,Variably modulated gating of the 26S proteasome by ATP and polyubiquitin.,"The 26S proteasome is a 2500 kDa protease complex that degrades polyubiquitylated proteins by a mechanism that requires ATP hydrolysis. It also degrades short non-ubiquitylated peptides and certain unstructured proteins by an energy-independent mechanism that requires bound ATP to maintain its component subcomplexes, the 20S proteasome and PA700, in a functionally assembled state. Proteolysis of both types of substrate requires PA700-induced opening of reversible gates at substrate-access pores of the 20S proteasome. In the present study we demonstrate that the rate of peptide substrate hydrolysis, a functional monitor of gate opening, is regulated variably by multiple effectors. ATPgammaS (adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) and other non-hydrolysable ATP analogues increased peptide substrate hydrolysis by intact 26S proteasomes. Thus nucleotides that maintained 26S proteasome structure, but did not support ATP hydrolysis or the degradation of polyubiquitylated proteins, promoted enhanced rates of peptide hydrolysis. Polyubiquitin and a peptoid that binds selectively to a single ATPase subunit of PA700 also increased rates of peptide hydrolysis but had disparate effects on rates of ATP hydrolysis. The effect of polyubiquitin was specific for ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages that supported proteolysis of protein substrates. These results indicate that gating of the 26S proteasome is not a simple two-state process but can be variably modulated. Our results suggest that modulated gating of the proteasome may be an important element of the mechanism of proteolysis of polyubiquitylated proteins."

The method involves the use of frequency-swept pulses which serve two simultaneous functions: (1) broad-band excitation of magnetization and (2) signal enhancement via population transfer. The signal enhancement mechanism is described using numerical simulations and confirmed experimentally. This approach, which we call DEISM (Direct Enhancement of Integer Spin Magnetization), allows high-quality (14)N spectra to be acquired at intermediate field strengths in an uncomplicated way and in a fraction of the time required for previously reported methods."

Transparent, in-plane lamellar films were first prepared by assembly of polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP), and subsequently the P2VP domains were swollen with a selective solvent, methanol. The swollen structures were then fixated by synthesizing SiO(2) nanoparticles within P2VP domains. The resulting frozen photonic gels (f-photonic gels) exhibited strong reflective colors with stop bands across the visible region of wavelengths."

The competition between N-pyridine coordination and Si-H bond activation was studied through its reactivity with two ruthenium complexes. The reaction between 1 and RuH(2)(H(2))(2)(PCy(3))(2) led to the isolation of the new complex RuH(2){(eta(2)-HSiMe(2))N(kappaN-C(5)H(4)N)(SiMe(2)H)}(PCy(3))(2) (2) resulting from the loss of two dihydrogen ligands and coordination of 1 to the ruthenium center via a kappa(2)N,(eta(2)-Si-H) mode. Complex 2 has been characterized by multinuclear NMR experiments ((1)H, (31)P, (13)C, (29)Si), X-ray diffraction and DFT studies. In particular, the HMBC (29)Si-(1)H spectrum supports the presence of two different silicon environments: one Si-H bond is dangling, whereas the other one is eta(2)-coordinated to the ruthenium with a J(SiH) value of 50 Hz. DFT calculations (B3PW91) were also carried out to evaluate the stability of the agostic species versus a formulation corresponding to a bis(sigma-Si-H) isomer and confirmed that N-coordination overcomes any stabilization that could be gained by the establishment of SISHA interactions. There is no exchange between the two Si-H bonds present in 2, as demonstrated by deuterium-labeling experiments. Heating 2 at 70 degrees C under vacuum for 24 h, leads to the formal loss of one equivalent of H(2) from 2 and formation of the 16-electron complex RuH{(SiMe(2))N(kappaN-C(5)H(4)N)(SiMe(2)H)}(PCy(3))(2) (3) formulated as a hydrido(silyl) species on the basis of multinuclear NMR experiments. The dehydrogenation reaction is fully reversible under dihydrogen atmosphere. Reaction of Ru(COD)(COT) with 3 equiv of 1 under a H(2) pressure led to the isolation of the new complex RuH{(SiMe(2))N(kappaN-C(5)H(4)N)(SiMe(2)H)}(3) (4) characterized as a hydridotrisilyl complex by multinuclear NMR techniques, X-ray and neutron diffractions, as well as DFT calculations. The (29)Si HMBC experiments confirm the presence of two different silicon atoms in 4, with a signal at -14.64 ppm for three dangling Si-Me(2)H fragments and a signal at 64.94 ppm (correlating with the hydride signal) assigned to three Si-Me(2)N groups bound to Ru. Comparison of DFT and neutron parameters involving the hydride clearly indicates an excellent correlation. The Si-H distance of approximately 2.15 A is much shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii and typically in the range of a significant interaction between a silicon and a hydrogen atom (SISHA interactions). In 4, three dangling Si-H groups remain accessible for further functionalization."

19474325,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Fluorescence patterns from supramolecular polymer assembly and disassembly for sensing metallo- and nonmetalloproteins.,"Critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of surfactants is lowered when polyelectrolytes act as counterions. At a concentration in between the CACs of the surfactant and the polymer-surfactant complex, protein-induced disassemblies can be achieved. This is because, when proteins competitively bind to the polyelectrolytes, the surfactants are not capable of sustaining a micelle-type assembly at this concentration. Since these amphiphilic aggregates are capable of noncovalently sequestering hydrophobic guest molecules, the protein binding induced disassembly process also results in a guest release from these assemblies. We show here that the change in fluorescence with different proteins is dependent not only on the nature of the polymer-surfactant complex, but also on the fluorescent transducer. Two processes can be responsible for the observed fluorescence change: fluorophore guest release from the hydrophobic interior of the assembly and excited state quenching due to complementary components in the analyte. The latter mechanism is especially possible with metalloproteins. We show here that an excited state quenching is possible at nanomolar concentrations of the proteins, while the disassembly based fluorescence reduction is the dominant pathway at micromolar concentrations."
19474328,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Mechanism of the orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase-catalyzed reaction: effect of solvent viscosity on kinetic constants.,"Orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) is an exceptionally proficient catalyst: the rate acceleration (k(cat)/k(non)) is 7.1 x 10(16), and the proficiency [(k(cat)/K(M))/k(non)] is 4.8 x 10(22) M(-1). The structural basis for the large rate acceleration and proficiency is unknown, although the mechanism has been established to involve a stabilized carbanion intermediate. To provide reaction coordinate context for interpretation of the values of k(cat), k(cat)/K(M), and kinetic isotope effects, we investigated the effect of solvent viscosity on k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) for the OMPDCs from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (MtOMPDC) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScOMPDC). For MtOMPDC, we used not only the natural OMP substrate but also a catalytically impaired mutant (D70N) and a more reactive substrate (FOMP); for ScOMPDC, we used OMP and FOMP. With MtOMPDC and OMP, k(cat) is independent of solvent viscosity, indicating that decarboxylation is fully rate-determining; k(cat)/K(M) displays a fractional dependence of solvent viscosity, suggesting that both substrate binding and decarboxylation determine this kinetic constant. For ScOMPDC with OMP, we observed that both k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) are fractionally dependent on solvent viscosity, suggesting that the rates of substrate binding, decarboxylation, and product dissociation are similar. Consistent with these interpretations, for both enzymes with FOMP, the increases in the values of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) are much less than expected based on the ability of the 5-fluoro substituent to stabilize the anionic intermediate; i.e., substrate binding and product dissociation mask the kinetic effects of stabilization of the intermediate by the substituent."

Proteome Res.,101128775,2009,"Comparison between the matrices alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-chloro-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin digestions by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.","The performance of the recently developed 4-chloro-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid (Cl-CCA) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) matrix was investigated in comparison to the most widely used matrix alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). For this purpose, in-solution digestions of standard proteins in the low femtomole range with the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin were used as analytes. For all protein-protease combinations, Cl-CCA revealed to be highly superior in terms of number of identified peptides, obtained sequence coverages and peptide detection reproducibility. A deeper inspection of the detected peptide signals with regard to both physicochemical peptide properties (their isoelectric point) and mass spectrometric performance (signal-to-noise ratios and mass accuracies) showed that the progress achieved with Cl-CCA is due to the detection of numerous acidic to neutral peptides. Moreover, the higher Cl-CCA sensitivity allowed for the detection of numerous additional phosphopeptides, all of which were verified by means of MS/MS investigations. The occurrence of strong signals of doubly charged peptides which is exclusively observed for the Cl-CCA matrix can be traced back to the peptide amino-acid composition, that is, the presence of a high number of basic amino acids (Arg, Lys, and His) and is thus more pronounced for nontryptic protein digests. These observed improvements well agree with an increased protonation reactivity of Cl-CCA and are more pronounced with a decreasing level of protease specificity and decreasing sample amounts."
19474404,0,Biochemistry,370623,2009,Monitoring the conformation of benzo[a]pyrene adducts in the polymerase active site using fluorescence resonance energy transfer.,"Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a potent environmental carcinogen that is metabolized into diol epoxides that react with exocyclic amines in DNA. These DNA adducts have been shown to block DNA replication by high-fidelity polymerases and induce both base substitution and frame-shift mutations. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of B[a]P-induced mutagenesis, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method was developed in which the (+)- or (-)-trans-anti-B[a]P-N(2)-dG adducts, positioned in the active site of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), serve as donor fluorophores to an acceptor molecule positioned on the DNA primer strand. FRET was measured for a primer that ended one nucleotide before the adduct position and one that ended across from the adduct and used to estimate the distances between the two fluorophores. These estimates are consistent with prior studies that suggest the adducts are positioned in the minor groove. A comparison of the FRET for the (+)- and (-)-trans-B[a]P adducts in the Klenow active site suggested that the (+)-trans adduct is positioned approximately 2 A farther from the acceptor, consistent with the structural differences observed in duplex DNA where it has been shown that the (+)-trans adduct is oriented toward the 5'-end of the template strand while the (-)-trans adduct lies toward the 3'-end. Surprisingly, the adduct position did not change significantly when the primer was one nucleotide longer. The addition of either a correct (dCTP) or incorrect nucleotides showed only minor differences in FRET, suggesting that the adduct did not undergo a large change in the position within the polymerase active site, as expected if the adduct inhibited the polymerase conformational change."
19474788,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,An integrated approach to identifying cis-regulatory modules in the human genome.,"In eukaryotic genomes, it is challenging to accurately determine target sites of transcription factors (TFs) by only using sequence information. Previous efforts were made to tackle this task by considering the fact that TF binding sites tend to be more conserved than other functional sites and the binding sites of several TFs are often clustered. Recently, ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing experiments have been accumulated to identify TF binding sites as well as survey the chromatin modification patterns at the regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We propose here a hidden Markov model (HMM) to incorporate sequence motif information, TF-DNA interaction data and chromatin modification patterns to precisely identify cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). We conducted ChIP-chip experiments on four TFs, CREB, E2F1, MAX, and YY1 in 1% of the human genome. We then trained a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify the labels of the CRMs by incorporating the sequence motifs recognized by these TFs and the ChIP-chip ratio. Chromatin modification data was used to predict the functional sites and to further remove false positives. Cross-validation showed that our integrated HMM had a performance superior to other existing methods on predicting CRMs. Incorporating histone signature information successfully penalized false prediction and improved the whole performance. The dataset we used and the software are available at http://nash.ucsd.edu/CIS/."
19476333,0,Cell Res.,9425763,2009,TRAIL receptor mediates inflammatory cytokine release in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner.,"In the present article, we report that DR4 or DR5 overexpression dramatically activates the release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8, TNF-alpha, CCL20, MIP-2 and MIP-1beta in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner in 293T, MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cells. We showed that death receptor-mediated signals were extracellular domain-independent, whereas the effect of overexpression of the DR4 intracellular domain was much less potent. The TRADD-TRAF2-NIK-IKKalpha/beta signaling cascade, which plays an essential role in TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, was found to be involved in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor-mediated signal transduction. The FADD-caspase signaling pathway, which has been reported to be mostly related to apoptosis, was identified as being essential for DR4 or DR5 overexpression-mediated NF-kappaB activation and cytokine secretion and crosstalks with the TRADD-TRAF2-NIK-IKKalpha/beta signaling cascade. Furthermore, a DR5 agonistic antibody (AD5-10) triggered the inflammatory cytokine release. These data, together with previous reports, provide strong evidence that TRAIL and TRAIL receptors play an important role in inflammation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,RNAi screen for rapid therapeutic target identification in leukemia patients.,"Targeted therapy has vastly improved outcomes in certain types of cancer. Extension of this paradigm across a broad spectrum of malignancies will require an efficient method to determine the molecular vulnerabilities of cancerous cells. Improvements in sequencing technology will soon enable high-throughput sequencing of entire genomes of cancer patients; however, determining the relevance of identified sequence variants will require complementary functional analyses. Here, we report an RNAi-assisted protein target identification (RAPID) technology that individually assesses targeting of each member of the tyrosine kinase gene family. We demonstrate that RAPID screening of primary leukemia cells from 30 patients identifies targets that are critical to survival of the malignant cells from 10 of these individuals. We identify known, activating mutations in JAK2 and K-RAS, as well as patient-specific sensitivity to down-regulation of FLT1, CSF1R, PDGFR, ROR1, EPHA4/5, JAK1/3, LMTK3, LYN, FYN, PTK2B, and N-RAS. We also describe a previously undescribed, somatic, activating mutation in the thrombopoietin receptor that is sensitive to down-stream pharmacologic inhibition. Hence, the RAPID technique can quickly identify molecular vulnerabilities in malignant cells. Combination of this technique with whole-genome sequencing will represent an ideal tool for oncogenic target identification such that specific therapies can be matched with individual patients."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Experience sampling during fMRI reveals default network and executive system contributions to mind wandering.,"Although mind wandering occupies a large proportion of our waking life, its neural basis and relation to ongoing behavior remain controversial. We report an fMRI study that used experience sampling to provide an online measure of mind wandering during a concurrent task. Analyses focused on the interval of time immediately preceding experience sampling probes demonstrate activation of default network regions during mind wandering, a finding consistent with theoretical accounts of default network functions. Activation in medial prefrontal default network regions was observed both in association with subjective self-reports of mind wandering and an independent behavioral measure (performance errors on the concurrent task). In addition to default network activation, mind wandering was associated with executive network recruitment, a finding predicted by behavioral theories of off-task thought and its relation to executive resources. Finally, neural recruitment in both default and executive network regions was strongest when subjects were unaware of their own mind wandering, suggesting that mind wandering is most pronounced when it lacks meta-awareness. The observed parallel recruitment of executive and default network regions--two brain systems that so far have been assumed to work in opposition--suggests that mind wandering may evoke a unique mental state that may allow otherwise opposing networks to work in cooperation. The ability of this study to reveal a number of crucial aspects of the neural recruitment associated with mind wandering underscores the value of combining subjective self-reports with online measures of brain function for advancing our understanding of the neurophenomenology of subjective experience."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Embryonic pig pancreatic tissue for the treatment of diabetes in a nonhuman primate model.,"Xenotransplantation of pig tissues has great potential to overcome the shortage of organ donors. One approach to address the vigorous immune rejection associated with xenotransplants is the use of embryonic precursor tissue, which induces and utilizes host vasculature upon its growth and development. Recently, we showed in mice that embryonic pig pancreatic tissue from embryonic day 42 (E42) exhibits optimal properties as a beta cell replacement therapy. We now demonstrate the proof of concept in 2 diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys, followed for 393 and 280 days, respectively. A marked reduction of exogenous insulin requirement was noted by the fourth month after transplantation, reaching complete independence from exogenous insulin during the fifth month after transplantation, with full physiological control of blood glucose levels. The porcine origin of insulin was documented by a radioimmunoassay specific for porcine C-peptide. Furthermore, the growing tissue was found to be predominantly vascularized with host blood vessels, thereby evading hyperacute or acute rejection, which could potentially be mediated by preexisting anti-pig antibodies. Durable graft protection was achieved, and most of the late complications could be attributed to the immunosuppressive protocol. While fine tuning of immune suppression, tissue dose, and implantation techniques are still required, our results demonstrate that porcine E-42 embryonic pancreatic tissue can normalize blood glucose levels in primates. Its long-term proliferative capacity, its revascularization by host endothelium, and its reduced immunogenicity, strongly suggest that this approach could offer an attractive replacement therapy for diabetes."

The extensive study of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium structure of different populations has made it possible to develop tagging and imputation strategies to comprehensively analyze common genetic variation in association studies of complex diseases. We assessed the benefit of a Mexican haplotype map to improve identification of genes related to common diseases in the Mexican population. We evaluated genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and extent of haplotype sharing using genomewide data from Mexican Mestizos from regions with different histories of admixture and particular population dynamics. Ancestry was evaluated by including 1 Mexican Amerindian group and data from the HapMap. Our results provide evidence of genetic differences between Mexican subpopulations that should be considered in the design and analysis of association studies of complex diseases. In addition, these results support the notion that a haplotype map of the Mexican Mestizo population can reduce the number of tag SNPs required to characterize common genetic variation in this population. This is one of the first genomewide genotyping efforts of a recently admixed population in Latin America."

Compared with wild type mice, the p50-KO mice had an increase in food intake, but a decrease in body fat content. On chow diet, their blood glucose dropped much more than the wild type (WT) mice in the insulin tolerance test. Their glucose infusion rate was 30% higher than that of the WT mice in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Their hepatic glucose production was suppressed more actively by insulin, and their insulin-induced glucose uptake was not altered in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. In the liver, their p70S6K (S6K1) protein was significantly lower, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression was much higher. Their S6K1 protein was reduced by TNF-alpha treatment in the primary culture of hepatocytes. S6K1 reduction was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In their livers, IKK2 (IKKbeta) activity was reduced together with IKKgamma. Their S6K1 degradation was dependent on IKK2 deficiency. Reconstitution of the S6K1 protein in their liver blocked the increase in insulin sensitivity. S6K1 degradation was not observed in hepatocytes of the WT mice. The data suggest that inactivation of NF-kappaB p50 leads to suppression of IKK2 activity in the liver. IKK2 deficiency leads to S6K1 inhibition through TNF-induced protein degradation. The S6K1 reduction may contribute to insulin sensitivity in p50-KO mice. This study suggests that hepatic S6K1 may be a drug target in the treatment of insulin resistance."
19476619,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Identification and characterization of RBEL1 subfamily of GTPases in the Ras superfamily involved in cell growth regulation.,"Recently, we reported the identification of a novel gene named RBEL1 (Rab-like protein 1) and characterized its two encoded isoforms, RBEL1A and RBEL1B, that function as novel GTPases of Ras superfamily. Here we report the identification of two additional splice variants of RBEL1 that we have named RBEL1C and -D. All four RBEL1 isoforms (A, B, C, and D) have identical N termini harboring the Rab-like GTPase domains but contain variable C termini. Although all isoforms can be detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus, RBEL1A is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas RBEL1B is mostly nuclear. RBEL1C and -D, by contrast, are evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, all four RBEL1 proteins are also capable of associating with cellular membrane. The RBEL1 proteins also exhibit a unique nucleotide-binding potential and, whereas the larger A and B isoforms are mainly GTP-bound, the smaller C and D variants bind to both GTP and GDP. Furthermore, a regulatory region at amino acid position 236-302 immediately adjacent to the GTP-binding domain is important for GTP-binding potential of RBEL1A, because deletion of this region converts RBEL1A from predominantly GTP-bound to GDP-bound. RBEL1 knockdown via RNA interference results in marked cell growth suppression, which is associated with morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis as well as inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicate that RBEL1 proteins are linked to cell growth and survival and possess unique biochemical, cellular, and functional characteristics and, therefore, appear to form a novel subfamily of GTPases within the Ras superfamily."

The binding of 11E10 to Stx2 neutralizes both the cytotoxic and lethal activities of Stx2, but the MAb does not bind to or neutralize Stx1 despite the 61% identity and 75% similarity in the amino acids of the A(1) fragments. In this study, we sought to identify the segment or segments on Stx2 that constitute the 11E10 epitope and to determine how recognition of that region by 11E10 leads to inactivation of the toxin. Toward those objectives, we generated a set of chimeric Stx1/Stx2 molecules and then evaluated the capacity of 11E10 to recognize those hybrid toxins by Western blot analyses and to neutralize them in Vero cell cytotoxicity assays. We also compared the amino acid sequences and crystal structures of Stx1 and Stx2 for stretches of dissimilarity that might predict a binding epitope on Stx2 for 11E10. Through these assessments, we concluded that the 11E10 epitope is comprised of three noncontiguous regions surrounding the Stx2 active site. To determine how 11E10 neutralizes Stx2, we examined the capacity of 11E10/Stx2 complexes to target ribosomes. We found that the binding of 11E10 to Stx2 prevented the toxin from inhibiting protein synthesis in an in vitro assay but also altered the overall cellular distribution of Stx2 in Vero cells. We propose that the binding of MAb 11E10 to Stx2 neutralizes the effects of the toxin by preventing the toxin from reaching and/or inactivating the ribosomes."
19477152,0,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,SLITHER: a web server for generating contiguous conformations of substrate molecules entering into deep active sites of proteins or migrating through channels in membrane transporters.,"Many proteins use a long channel to guide the substrate or ligand molecules into the well-defined active sites for catalytic reactions or for switching molecular states. In addition, substrates of membrane transporters can migrate to another side of cellular compartment by means of certain selective mechanisms. SLITHER (http://bioinfo.mc.ntu.edu.tw/slither/or http://slither.rcas.sinica.edu.tw/) is a web server that can generate contiguous conformations of a molecule along a curved tunnel inside a protein, and the binding free energy profile along the predicted channel pathway. SLITHER adopts an iterative docking scheme, which combines with a puddle-skimming procedure, i.e. repeatedly elevating the potential energies of the identified global minima, thereby determines the contiguous binding modes of substrates inside the protein. In contrast to some programs that are widely used to determine the geometric dimensions in the ion channels, SLITHER can be applied to predict whether a substrate molecule can crawl through an inner channel or a half-channel of proteins across surmountable energy barriers. Besides, SLITHER also provides the list of the pore-facing residues, which can be directly compared with many genetic diseases. Finally, the adjacent binding poses determined by SLITHER can also be used for fragment-based drug design."

In this study we investigate the function of Reh1, a protein with high sequence similarity to Rei1. We demonstrate an overlapping function for Reh1 and Rei1 in the cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S subunit that is independent of Arx1 recycling. We observe that strains lacking both Reh1 and Rei1 accumulate salt-labile 60S subunits, suggesting that Reh1/Rei1 is necessary for the cytoplasmic 60S subunit to adopt its mature, stable form."
19477156,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,The small molecule phenamil induces osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.,"Stimulation of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells is a potential strategy for bone repair. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that induce osteoblastic differentiation have been successfully used in humans to treat fractures. Here we outline a new approach to the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation using small molecules that stimulate BMP activity. We have identified the amiloride derivative phenamil as a stimulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Remarkably, phenamil acts cooperatively with BMPs to induce the expression of BMP target genes, osteogenic markers, and matrix mineralization in both mesenchymal stem cell lines and calvarial organ cultures. Transcriptional profiling of cells treated with phenamil led to the identification of tribbles homolog 3 (Trb3) as a mediator of its effects. Trb3 is induced by phenamil selectively in cells with osteoblastic potential. Both Trb3 and phenamil stabilize the expression of SMAD, the critical transcription factor in BMP signaling, by promoting the degradation of SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Trb3 blunts the effects of phenamil on BMP signaling and osteogenesis. Thus, phenamil induces osteogenic differentiation, at least in part, through Trb3-dependent promotion of BMP action. The synergistic use of small molecules such as phenamil along with BMPs may provide new strategies for the promotion of bone healing."

Biophys.,372430,2009,Myofilament incorporation determines the stoichiometry of troponin I in transgenic expression and the rescue of a null mutation.,"The highly organized contractile machinery in skeletal and cardiac muscles requires an assembly of myofilament proteins with stringent stoichiometry. To understand the maintenance of myofilament protein stoichiometry under dynamic protein synthesis and catabolism in muscle cells, we investigated the equilibrium of troponin I (TnI) in mouse cardiac muscle during developmental isoform switching and in under- and over-expression models. Compared with the course of developmental TnI isoform switching in normal hearts, the postnatal presence of slow skeletal muscle TnI lasted significantly longer in the hearts of cardiac TnI (cTnI) knockout (cTnI-KO) mice, in which the diminished synthesis was compensated by prolonging the life of myofilamental TnI. Transgenic postnatal expression of an N-terminal truncated cTnI (cTnI-ND) using alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter effectively rescued the lethality of cTnI-KO mice and shortened the postnatal presence of slow TnI in cardiac muscle. cTnI-KO mice rescued with different levels of cTnI-ND over-expression exhibited similar levels of myocardial TnI comparable to that in wild type hearts, demonstrating that excessive synthesis would not increase TnI stoichiometry in the myofilaments. Consistently, haploid under-expression of cTnI in heterozygote cTnI-KO mice was sufficient to sustain the normal level of myocardial cTnI, indicating that cTnI is synthesized in excess in wild type cardiomyocytes. Altogether, these observations suggest that under wide ranges of protein synthesis and turnover, myofilament incorporation determines the stoichiometry of troponin subunits in muscle cells."
19477163,1,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,The allyl intermediate in regioselective and enantioselective iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions.,"The isolation and structural characterization of metallacyclic allyl (2a) and crotyl (2b) iridium complexes are reported. Complexes 2a and 2b are rare examples of iriduim allyl complexes that undergo nucleophilic attack at terminal position, rather than the central position, of the allyl unit. Structures of 2a and 2b were obtained by X-ray diffraction. Nucleophilic attack was observed at the carbon that is bound to iridium trans to phosphorus through a longer Ir-C bond. However, the effect of the trans phosphine ligand on the Ir-C bond lengths was smaller than the effect of the substituent on the allyl group in 2b. The competence of complexes 2a and 2b to be intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric allylic substitutions was evaluated by studying their reactivity toward stabilized carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles and comparing the rates and selectivities to those of the catalytic reactions. The stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of stoichiometric reactions of 2b were similar to those of reactions catalyzed by the previously reported iridium catalysts, supporting their intermediacy in the catalytic reactions. On the basis of the structural data, a model is proposed for the origin of stereoselectivity in iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions."

Proteome Res.,101128775,2009,"Proteomic analyses of the two mucus layers of the colon barrier reveal that their main component, the Muc2 mucin, is strongly bound to the Fcgbp protein.","The colon epithelium is protected from the luminal microbes as recently revealed by an inner firmly attached mucus layer impervious to bacteria and an outer loose mucus layer that is the habitat of bacteria. For an additional understanding of these layers, we analyzed the protein composition of these two mucus layers from the mouse colon. Proteomics using nano-LC-MS and MS/MS revealed more than 1000 protein entries. As the mucus layers contain detached cells, a majority of the proteins had an intracellular origin. However, at least 44 entries were described as secreted proteins and predicted to be mucus constituents together with extracellular/plasma and bacterial proteins, the latter largely in the loose mucus layer. A major protein was the Muc2 mucin that by its net-like disulfide-bonded polymer structure builds the mucus. When guanidinium chloride insoluble Muc2 units were analyzed, N-terminal parts of the Fc-gamma binding protein (Fcgbp) was found to be covalently attached in mouse and human colon, whereas its C-terminus was lost by reducing the disulfide bonds. In conclusion, the Fcgbp protein is probably cleaved at GD/PH and covalently attached to Muc2 via one or several of its von Willebrand D domains."
19477525,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,CD133 (Prominin) negative human neural stem cells are clonogenic and tripotent.,"BACKGROUND: CD133 (Prominin) is widely used as a marker for the identification and isolation of neural precursor cells from normal brain or tumor tissue. However, the assumption that CD133 is expressed constitutively in neural precursor cells has not been examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we demonstrate that CD133 and a second marker CD15 are expressed heterogeneously in uniformly undifferentiated human neural stem (NS) cell cultures. After fractionation by flow cytometry, clonogenic tripotent cells are found in populations negative or positive for either marker. We further show that CD133 is down-regulated at the mRNA level in cells lacking CD133 immunoreactivity. Cell cycle profiling reveals that CD133 negative cells largely reside in G1/G0, while CD133 positive cells are predominantly in S, G2, or M phase. A similar pattern is apparent in mouse NS cell lines. Compared to mouse NS cells, however, human NS cell cultures harbour an increased proportion of CD133 negative cells and display a longer doubling time. This may in part reflect a sub-population of slow- or non-cycling cells amongst human NS cells because we find that around 5% of cells do not take up BrdU over a 14-day labelling period. Non-proliferating NS cells remain undifferentiated and at least some of them are capable of re-entry into the cell cycle and subsequent continuous expansion. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that a significant fraction of clonogenic neural stem cells lack the established markers CD133 and CD15, and that some of these cells may be dormant or slow-cycling, has implications for approaches to identify and isolate neural stem cells and brain cancer stem cells. Our data also suggest the possibility that CD133 may be specifically down-regulated during G0/G1, and this should be considered when this marker is used to identify and isolate other tissue and cancer stem cells."
19477955,0,Nat. Genet.,9216904,2009,A common allele in RPGRIP1L is a modifier of retinal degeneration in ciliopathies.,"Despite rapid advances in the identification of genes involved in disease, the predictive power of the genotype remains limited, in part owing to poorly understood effects of second-site modifiers. Here we demonstrate that a polymorphic coding variant of RPGRIP1L (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like), a ciliary gene mutated in Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Joubert (JBTS) syndromes, is associated with the development of retinal degeneration in individuals with ciliopathies caused by mutations in other genes. As part of our resequencing efforts of the ciliary proteome, we identified several putative loss-of-function RPGRIP1L mutations, including one common variant, A229T. Multiple genetic lines of evidence showed this allele to be associated with photoreceptor loss in ciliopathies. Moreover, we show that RPGRIP1L interacts biochemically with RPGR, loss of which causes retinal degeneration, and that the Thr229-encoded protein significantly compromises this interaction. Our data represent an example of modification of a discrete phenotype of syndromic disease and highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach for the discovery of modifier alleles of intermediate frequency and effect."

We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P &lt; 10(-6)). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P &lt; 0.01; overall P &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P &lt; 0.05).

Whether the type of recognition receptor used in these responses is determined by the subcellular location of bacteria is not understood. Here we show that phagosomal bacteria such as group B streptococcus, but not cytosolic bacteria, potently induced interferon in conventional dendritic cells by a mechanism that required Toll-like receptor 7, the adaptor MyD88 and the transcription factor IRF1, all of which localized together with bacterial products in degradative vacuoles bearing lysosomal markers. Thus, this cell type-specific recognition pathway links lysosomal recognition of bacterial RNA with a robust, host-protective interferon response."

19478177,0,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Text-based over-representation analysis of microarray gene lists with annotation bias.,"A major challenge in microarray data analysis is the functional interpretation of gene lists. A common approach to address this is over-representation analysis (ORA), which uses the hypergeometric test (or its variants) to evaluate whether a particular functionally defined group of genes is represented more than expected by chance within a gene list. Existing applications of ORA have been largely limited to pre-defined terminologies such as GO and KEGG. We report our explorations of whether ORA can be applied to a wider mining of free-text. We found that a hitherto underappreciated feature of experimentally derived gene lists is that the constituents have substantially more annotation associated with them, as they have been researched upon for a longer period of time. This bias, a result of patterns of research activity within the biomedical community, is a major problem for classical hypergeometric test-based ORA approaches, which cannot account for such bias. We have therefore developed three approaches to overcome this bias, and demonstrate their usability in a wide range of published datasets covering different species. A comparison with existing tools that use GO terms suggests that mining PubMed abstracts can reveal additional biological insight that may not be possible by mining pre-defined ontologies alone."
19478179,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Role of dimerization and substrate exclusion in the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein-1 and mammalian tolloid.,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-1/tolloid metalloproteinases are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that are fundamental to dorsal-ventral patterning and tissue morphogenesis. The lack of knowledge regarding how these proteinases recognize and cleave their substrates represents a major hurdle to understanding tissue assembly and embryonic patterning. Although BMP-1 and mammalian tolloid (mTLD) are splice variants, it is puzzling why BMP-1, which lacks 3 of the 7 noncatalytic domains present in all other family members, is the most effective proteinase. Using a combination of single-particle electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and other biophysical measurements in solution, we show that mTLD, but not BMP-1, forms a calcium-ion-dependent dimer under physiological conditions. Using a domain deletion approach, we provide evidence that EGF2, which is absent in BMP-1, is critical to the formation of the dimer. Based on a combination of structural and functional data, we propose that mTLD activity is regulated by a substrate exclusion mechanism. These results provide a mechanistic insight into how alternative splicing of the Bmp1 gene produces 2 proteinases with differing biological activities and have broad implications for regulation of BMP-1/mTLD and related proteinases during BMP signaling and tissue assembly."
19478336,0,Nucleic Acids Res.,411011,2009,Functional mapping of the interaction between TDP-43 and hnRNP A2 in vivo.,"Nuclear factor TDP-43 has been reported to play multiple roles in transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and mRNA transport. From a structural point of view, TDP-43 is a member of the hnRNP protein family whose structure includes two RRM domains flanked by the N-terminus and C-terminal regions. Like many members of this family, the C-terminal region can interact with cellular factors and thus serve to modulate its function. Previously, we have described that TDP-43 binds to several members of the hnRNP A/B family through this region. In this work, we set up a coupled minigene/siRNA cellular system that allows us to obtain in vivo data to address the functional significance of TDP-43-recruited hnRNP complex formation. Using this method, we have finely mapped the interaction between TDP-43 and the hnRNP A2 protein to the region comprised between amino acid residues 321 and 366. Our results provide novel details of protein-protein interactions in splicing regulation. In addition, we provide further insight on TDP-43 functional properties, particularly the lack of effects, as seen with our assays, of the disease-associated mutations that fall within the TDP-43 321-366 region: Q331K, M337V and G348C."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Differential regulation of cell type-specific apoptosis by stromelysin-3: a potential mechanism via the cleavage of the laminin receptor during tail resorption in Xenopus laevis.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been extensively studied because of their functional attributes in development and diseases. However, relatively few in vivo functional studies have been reported on the roles of MMPs in postembryonic organ development. Amphibian metamorphosis is a unique model for studying MMP function during vertebrate development because of its dependence on thyroid hormone (T3) and the ability to easily manipulate this process with exogenous T3. The MMP stromelysin-3 (ST3) is induced by T3, and its expression correlates with cell death during metamorphosis. We have previously shown that ST3 is both necessary and sufficient for larval epithelial cell death in the remodeling intestine. To investigate the roles of ST3 in other organs and especially on different cell types, we have analyzed the effect of transgenic overexpression of ST3 in the tail of premetamorphic tadpoles. We report for the first time that ST3 expression, in the absence of T3, caused significant muscle cell death in the tail of premetamorphic transgenic tadpoles. On the other hand, only relatively low levels of epidermal cell death were induced by precocious ST3 expression in the tail, contrasting what takes place during natural and T3-induced metamorphosis when ST3 expression is high. This cell type-specific apoptotic response to ST3 in the tail suggests distinct mechanisms regulating cell death in different tissues. Furthermore, our analyses of laminin receptor, an in vivo substrate of ST3 in the intestine, suggest that laminin receptor cleavage may be an underlying mechanism for the cell type-specific effects of ST3."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,A novel mitochondrial sphingomyelinase in zebrafish cells.,"Sphingolipids are important signaling molecules in many biological processes, but little is known regarding their physiological roles in the mitochondrion. We focused on the biochemical characters of a novel sphingomyelinase (SMase) and its function in mitochondrial ceramide generation in zebrafish embryonic cells. The cloned SMase cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 545 amino acid residues (putative molecular weight, 61,300) containing a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) and a predicted transmembrane domain. The mature endogenous enzyme was predicted to have a molecular weight of 57,000, and matrix-assisted laser de sorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the N-terminal amino acid residue of the mature enzyme was Ala-36. The purified enzyme optimally hydrolyzed [(14)C]sphingomyelin in the presence of 10 mm Mg(2+) at pH 7.5. In HEK293 cells that overexpressed SMase cDNA, the enzyme was localized to the mitochondrial fraction, whereas mutant proteins lacking MLS or both the MLS and the transmembrane domain were absent from the mitochondrial fraction. Endogenous SMase protein co-localized with a mitochondrial cytostaining marker. Using a protease protection assay, we found that SMase was distributed throughout the intermembrane space and/or the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Furthermore, the overexpression of SMase in HEK293 cells induced ceramide generation and sphingomyelin hydrolysis in the mitochondrial fraction. Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide-induced knockdown repressed ceramide generation and sphingomyelin hydrolysis in the mitochondrial fraction in zebrafish embryonic cells. These observations indicate that SMase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and generates ceramide in mitochondria in fish cells."

19478779,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,A redox-mediated modulation of stem bolting in transgenic Nicotiana sylvestris differentially expressing the external mitochondrial NADPH dehydrogenase.,"Cytosolic NADPH can be directly oxidized by a calcium-dependent NADPH dehydrogenase, NDB1, present in the plant mitochondrial electron transport chain. However, little is known regarding the impact of modified cytosolic NADPH reduction levels on growth and metabolism. Nicotiana sylvestris plants overexpressing potato (Solanum tuberosum) NDB1 displayed early bolting, whereas sense suppression of the same gene led to delayed bolting, with consequential changes in flowering time. The phenotype was dependent on light irradiance but not linked to any change in biomass accumulation. Whereas the leaf NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was unaffected, the stem NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was altered following the genetic modification and strongly correlated with the bolting phenotype. Metabolic profiling of the stem showed that the NADP(H) change affected relatively few, albeit central, metabolites, including 2-oxoglutarate, glutamate, ascorbate, sugars, and hexose-phosphates. Consistent with the phenotype, the modified NDB1 level also affected the expression of putative floral meristem identity genes of the SQUAMOSA and LEAFY types. Further evidence for involvement of the NADPH redox in stem development was seen in the distinct decrease in the stem apex NADPH/NADP(+) ratio during bolting. Additionally, the potato NDB1 protein was specifically detected in mitochondria, and a survey of its abundance in major organs revealed that the highest levels are found in green stems. These results thus strongly suggest that NDB1 in the mitochondrial electron transport chain can, by modifying cell redox levels, specifically affect developmental processes."
19478798,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Overexpression of the transcription factor AP37 in rice improves grain yield under drought conditions.,"Transcription factors with an APETELA2 (AP2) domain have been implicated in various cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Of the 139 AP2 genes predicted in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified 42 genes in our current study that are induced by one or more stress conditions, including drought, high salinity, low temperature, and abscisic acid. Phylogenic analysis of these 42 stress-inducible AP2 genes revealed the presence of six subgroups (I-VI) with distinct signature motifs. Two genes, AP37 and AP59, representing subgroups I and II, respectively, were functionally characterized. Both genes were found to be induced upon 2 h of exposure to drought and high-salinity conditions but to differ in their expression profile upon exposure to low temperature and abscisic acid. The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage. Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in OsCc1:AP37 plants. More importantly, the OsCc1:AP37 plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by 16% to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth conditions. In contrast, grain yield in OsCc1:AP59 plants in the field was reduced by 23% to 43% compared with controls under both normal and drought stress conditions. Microarray experiments identified 10 and 38 genes that are up-regulated by AP37 and AP59, respectively, in addition to 37 genes that are commonly induced by both factors. Our results suggest that the AP37 gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes."
19478877,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,TTLL10 can perform tubulin glycylation when co-expressed with TTLL8.,"Tubulin can undergo unusual post-translational modifications, glycylation and glutamylation. We previously failed to find glycylase (glycine ligase) for tubulin while identifying TTLL10 as a polyglycylase for nucleosome assembly protein 1. We here examine whether TTLL10 performs tubulin glycylation. We used a polyclonal antibody (R-polygly) raised against a poly(glycine) chain, which does not recognize monoglycylated protein. R-polygly strongly reacted with mouse tracheal cilia and axonemal tubulins. R-polygly detected many proteins in cell lysates co-expressing TTLL10 with TTLL8. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the R-polygly-reactive proteins included alpha- and beta-tubulin. R-polygly labeling signals overlapped with microtubules. These results indicate that TTLL10 can strongly glycylate tubulin in a TTLL8-dependent manner. Furthermore, these two TTLL proteins can glycylate unidentified 170-, 110-, 75-, 40-, 35-, and 30-kDa acidic proteins."

HIFs are mainly regulated by a group of prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) that in the presence of oxygen, target the HIFalpha subunit for degradation. Herein, we studied the role of nitric oxide (NO) in regulating PHD activities under normoxic conditions. In the present study we show that different NO-donors initially inhibited endogenous PHD2 activity which led to accumulation of HIF-1alpha subsequently to enhance HIF-1 dependent increased PHD2 promoter activity. Consequently PHD2 abundance and activity were strongly induced which caused downregulation of HIF-1alpha. Interestingly, upregulation of endogenous PHD2 activity by NO was not found in cells that lack an intact pVHL dependent degradation pathway. Recovery of PHD activity required intact cells and was not observed in cell extracts or recombinant PHD2. In conclusion induction of endogenous PHD2 activity by NO is dependent on a feedback loop initiated despite normoxic conditions."

Despite the fact that many different therapeutic strategies have been applied to prevent disease progression, no cure or effective therapy is currently available for ALS. We found that L-arginine protects cultured motor neurons from excitotoxic injury. We also found that L-arginine supplementation both prior to and after the onset of motor neuron degeneration in mtSOD1 (G93A) transgenic ALS mice significantly slowed the progression of neuropathology in lumbar spinal cord, delayed onset of motor dysfunction, and prolonged life span. Moreover, L-arginine treatment was associated with preservation of arginase I activity and neuroprotective polyamines in spinal cord motor neurons. Our findings show that L-arginine has potent in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective properties and may be a candidate for therapeutic trials in ALS."
19478997,0,Mol. Immunol.,7905289,2009,PI3 kinase function is vital for the function but not formation of LAT-mediated signaling complexes.,"The induction of the T cell receptor (TCR) is necessary for the activation and function of human T cells. TCR activation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT, leading to the direct interaction with several proteins, including PLC-gamma 1, Grb2 and Gads. These direct ligands then mediate the indirect interaction of LAT with proteins, such as SLP-76, Vav1 and Itk. PLC-gamma 1, Vav1 and Itk contain pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that interact with the enzymatic product of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), suggesting the function of PI3K may modulate LAT-mediated complexes. Therefore, we characterized the poorly understood role of PI3K activity in the formation and function of multiprotein signaling complexes that form at LAT. Inhibition of PI3K catalytic function had little effect on the phosphorylation of LAT, SLP-76, Vav1 or PLC-gamma 1 or on the ability of PLC-gamma 1 to interact with LAT or SLP-76. However, PI3K activity appeared to be required for the induction of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that the formation of LAT-mediated complexes do not appear to depend on PI3K activity, whereas the optimal downstream function of these complexes requires the catalytic function of PI3K."
19479029,1,Methods,9426302,2009,Exploring translation regulation by global analysis of ribosomal association.,"Translation efficiency of an mRNA is related in most cases to its ribosomal association. This association can be readily measured through the separation of cellular complexes on sucrose gradients by velocity sedimentation, and identification of the sedimentation position of the mRNA in the gradient. Since ribosomes are the main driving force for mRNA sedimentation, sedimentation position is highly correlated with ribosomal association and thus translation efficiency. The advent of DNA microarrays allowed the determination of ribosomal association for many mRNAs in parallel through the combination of fractionation in a sucrose gradient followed by microarray analysis. This provided an enormous amount of novel information regarding translation control and regulation. Herein we provide a detailed protocol for performing such an analysis, indicating important points for consideration and discussing some of the advantages and limitations of this powerful approach."
19479048,0,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Profiling of anti-fibrotic signaling by hepatocyte growth factor in renal fibroblasts.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional growth factor affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. Due to its mitogenic potential, HGF plays an important role in tubular repair and regeneration after acute renal injury. However, recent reports have shown that HGF also acts as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic factor, affecting various cell types such as renal fibroblasts and triggering tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the kidney. The present study provides evidence that HGF stimulation of renal fibroblasts results in the activation of both the Erk1/2 and the Akt pathways. As previously shown, Erk1/2 phosphorylation results in Smad-linker phosphorylation, thereby antagonizing cellular signals induced by TGFbeta. By siRNA mediated silencing of the Erk1/2-Smad linkage, however, we now demonstrate that Akt signaling acts as an auxiliary pathway responsible for the anti-fibrotic effects of HGF. In order to define the anti-fibrotic function of HGF we performed comprehensive expression profiling of HGF-stimulated renal fibroblasts by microarray hybridization. Functional cluster analyses and quantitative PCR assays indicate that the HGF-stimulated pathways transfer the anti-fibrotic effects in renal interstitial fibroblasts by reducing expression of extracellular matrix proteins, various chemokines, and members of the CCN family."

Our web tools attempt to respond to these researchers' needs by facilitating the possibility to test and formulate from a hypothesis to entire models under a holistic point of view. RESULTS: PCOPGene-Net is a web application for facilitating the study of the relationships among gene expressions under microarray conditions, to classify these conditions and to study their effect on expression relationships. Furthermore, the system guides the researcher in the navigation through the microarray data by providing the most suitable genes and information for the researcher's interests at each moment. We achieve all of these by means of the zoom-out operation, the zoom-in operation, the non-continuous analysis and crossing the PCOPGene results with external data-servers. CONCLUSION: PCOPGene-Net helps to identify cellular states and the genes involved in these. All of that is accomplished in a flexible way, guided by the researcher's interests and taking advantage of the ability of our system to relate gene expressions, even when these relationships are non-continuous and cannot be found using linear or non-linear analytical methods. Currently, our tools are used for tumour-progression study from a holistic point of view."

Experiments were undertaken to evaluate the effects of factors that stimulate the secretion of HDL from the liver on the release of HL. Treatment of HepG2 cells with linoleic acid phospholipids (LAPL) (12 muM) promotes a similar increase in the accumulation of both HDL and HL in the cell media. LAPL also induce both apoA-I and HL release from primary human hepatocytes. Dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine has a greater effect on both apoA-I secretion and HL release than palmitoyllinoleoylphosphatidylcholine. HL released from HepG2 cells is inactive and associated with a large HDL complex containing both apoA-I and apoA-II. Inclusion of the PPARalpha inhibitor, MK-886, or MAPK inhibitor, U0126, completely blocks the LAPL-induced apoA-I and HL accumulation in the media. LAPL-treated cell lysates, however, showed no change in HL protein expression nor HL mRNA. LAPL-induced HL release appears to be a consequence of the displacement ability of newly secreted HDL. Overexpression of pre-pro-apoA-I in HepG2 cells increased HL release, while siRNA inhibition of the apoA-I gene reduced HL in the media. The data show that factors that stimulate HDL secretion in hepatocytes act to also increase the release of HL. This may partly explain why HDL therapeutics often impact plasma triglyceride levels."
19479080,0,J. Clin. Invest.,7802877,2009,Lithium-mediated protection of hippocampal cells involves enhancement of DNA-PK-dependent repair in mice.,"Long-term neurological deficiencies resulting from hippocampal cytotoxicity induced by cranial irradiation (IR) present a challenge in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain cancers, especially in children. Previously, we showed that lithium protected hippocampal neurons from IR-induced apoptosis and improved neurocognitive function in treated mice. Here, we demonstrate accelerated repair of IR-induced chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) in lithium-treated neurons. Lithium treatment not only increased IR-induced DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) threonine 2609 foci, a surrogate marker for activated nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, but also enhanced double-strand DNA end-rejoining activity in hippocampal neurons. The increased NHEJ repair coincided with reduced numbers of IR-induced gamma-H2AX foci, well-characterized in situ markers of DSBs. These findings were confirmed in vivo in irradiated mice. Consistent with a role of NHEJ repair in lithium-mediated neuroprotection, attenuation of IR-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by lithium was dramatically abrogated when DNA-PK function was abolished genetically in SCID mice or inhibited biochemically by the DNA-PK inhibitor IC86621. Importantly, none of these findings were evident in glioma cancer cells. These results support our hypothesis that lithium protects hippocampal neurons by promoting the NHEJ repair-mediated DNA repair pathway and warrant future investigation of lithium-mediated neuroprotection during cranial IR, especially in the pediatric population."
19479081,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Enhanced monocyte response and decreased central memory T cells in children with invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections.,"Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a significant pathogen causing severe invasive disease in otherwise healthy people. Despite considerable advances in understanding the epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, and virulence factors produced by the bacteria, there is limited knowledge of the in vivo host immune response to acute, invasive S. aureus infections. Herein, we report that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe S. aureus infections demonstrate a distinctive and robust gene expression profile which is validated in a distinct group of patients and on a different microarray platform. Application of a systems-wide modular analysis framework reveals significant over-expression of innate immunity genes and under-expression of genes related to adaptive immunity. Simultaneous flow cytometry analyses demonstrated marked alterations in immune cell numbers, with decreased central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells and increased numbers of monocytes. CD14+ monocyte numbers significantly correlated with the gene expression levels of genes related to the innate immune response. These results demonstrate the value of applying a systems biology approach that reveals the significant alterations in the components of circulating blood lymphocytes and monocytes in invasive S. aureus infections."
19479085,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Interface analysis of the complex between ERK2 and PTP-SL.,"The activity of ERK2, an essential component of MAP-kinase pathway, is under the strict control of various effector proteins. Despite numerous efforts, no crystal structure of ERK2 complexed with such partners has been obtained so far. PTP-SL is a major regulator of ERK2 activity. To investigate the ERK2-PTP-SL complex we used a combined method based on cross-linking, MALDI-TOF analysis, isothermal titration calorimetry, molecular modeling and docking. Hence, new insights into the stoichiometry, thermodynamics and interacting regions of the complex are obtained and a structural model of ERK2-PTP-SL complex in a state consistent with PTP-SL phosphatase activity is developed incorporating all the experimental constraints available at hand to date. According to this model, part of the N-terminal region of PTP-SL has propensity for intrinsic disorder and becomes structured within the complex with ERK2. The proposed model accounts for the structural basis of several experimental findings such as the complex-dissociating effect of ATP, or PTP-SL blocking effect on the ERK2 export to the nucleus. A general observation emerging from this model is that regions involved in substrate binding in PTP-SL and ERK2, respectively are interacting within the interface of the complex."
19479724,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Identification of genes contributing to the virulence of Francisella tularensis SCHU S4 in a mouse intradermal infection model.,"BACKGROUND: Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent human pathogen. The most virulent strains belong to subspecies tularensis and these strains cause a sometimes fatal disease. Despite an intense recent research effort, there is very limited information available that explains the unique features of subspecies tularensis strains that distinguish them from other F. tularensis strains and that explain their high virulence. Here we report the use of targeted mutagenesis to investigate the roles of various genes or pathways for the virulence of strain SCHU S4, the type strain of subspecies tularensis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The virulence of SCHU S4 mutants was assessed by following the outcome of infection after intradermal administration of graded doses of bacteria. By this route, the LD(50) of the SCHU S4 strain is one CFU. The virulence of 20 in-frame deletion mutants and 37 transposon mutants was assessed. A majority of the mutants did not show increased prolonged time to death, among them notably Delta pyrB and Delta recA. Of the remaining, mutations in six unique targets, tolC, rep, FTT0609, FTT1149c, ahpC, and hfq resulted in significantly prolonged time to death and mutations in nine targets, rplA, wbtI, iglB, iglD, purL, purF, ggt, kdtA, and glpX, led to marked attenuation with an LD(50) of &gt; 10(3) CFU. In fact, the latter seven mutants showed very marked attenuation with an LD(50) of &gt; or = 10(7) CFU. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate that the characterization of targeted mutants yielded important information about essential virulence determinants that will help to identify the so far little understood extreme virulence of F. tularensis subspecies tularensis."
19480626,1,PLoS Pathog.,101238921,2009,Dual role for pilus in adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm formation in Streptococcus agalactiae.,"Streptococcus agalactiae is a common human commensal and a major life-threatening pathogen in neonates. Adherence to host epithelial cells is the first critical step of the infectious process. Pili have been observed on the surface of several gram-positive bacteria including S. agalactiae. We previously characterized the pilus-encoding operon gbs1479-1474 in strain NEM316. This pilus is composed of three structural subunit proteins: Gbs1478 (PilA), Gbs1477 (PilB), and Gbs1474 (PilC), and its assembly involves two class C sortases (SrtC3 and SrtC4). PilB, the bona fide pilin, is the major component; PilA, the pilus associated adhesin, and PilC, are both accessory proteins incorporated into the pilus backbone. We first addressed the role of the housekeeping sortase A in pilus biogenesis and showed that it is essential for the covalent anchoring of the pilus fiber to the peptidoglycan. We next aimed at understanding the role of the pilus fiber in bacterial adherence and at resolving the paradox of an adhesive but dispensable pilus. Combining immunoblotting and electron microscopy analyses, we showed that the PilB fiber is essential for efficient PilA display on the surface of the capsulated strain NEM316. We then demonstrated that pilus integrity becomes critical for adherence to respiratory epithelial cells under flow-conditions mimicking an in vivo situation and revealing the limitations of the commonly used static adherence model. Interestingly, PilA exhibits a von Willebrand adhesion domain (VWA) found in many extracellular eucaryotic proteins. We show here that the VWA domain of PilA is essential for its adhesive function, demonstrating for the first time the functionality of a prokaryotic VWA homolog. Furthermore, the auto aggregative phenotype of NEM316 observed in standing liquid culture was strongly reduced in all three individual pilus mutants. S. agalactiae strain NEM316 was able to form biofilm in microtiter plate and, strikingly, the PilA and PilB mutants were strongly impaired in biofilm formation. Surprisingly, the VWA domain involved in adherence to epithelial cells was not required for biofilm formation."
19480637,0,PLoS Comput. Biol.,101238922,2009,Differential affinity and catalytic activity of CheZ in E. coli chemotaxis.,"Push-pull networks, in which two antagonistic enzymes control the activity of a messenger protein, are ubiquitous in signal transduction pathways. A classical example is the chemotaxis system of the bacterium Escherichia coli, in which the kinase CheA and the phosphatase CheZ regulate the phosphorylation level of the messenger protein CheY. Recent experiments suggest that both the kinase and the phosphatase are localized at the receptor cluster, and Vaknin and Berg recently demonstrated that the spatial distribution of the phosphatase can markedly affect the dose-response curves. We argue, using mathematical modeling, that the canonical model of the chemotaxis network cannot explain the experimental observations of Vaknin and Berg. We present a new model, in which a small fraction of the phosphatase is localized at the receptor cluster, while the remainder freely diffuses in the cytoplasm; moreover, the phosphatase at the cluster has a higher binding affinity for the messenger protein and a higher catalytic activity than the phosphatase in the cytoplasm. This model is consistent with a large body of experimental data and can explain many of the experimental observations of Vaknin and Berg. More generally, the combination of differential affinity and catalytic activity provides a generic mechanism for amplifying signals that could be exploited in other two-component signaling systems. If this model is correct, then a number of recent modeling studies, which aim to explain the chemotactic gain in terms of the activity of the receptor cluster, should be reconsidered."
19480662,1,Circ. Res.,47103,2009,The Tbx2+ primary myocardium of the atrioventricular canal forms the atrioventricular node and the base of the left ventricle.,"The primary myocardium of the embryonic heart, including the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract, is essential for septation and valve formation. In the chamber-forming heart, the expression of the T-box transcription factor Tbx2 is restricted to the primary myocardium. To gain insight into the cellular contributions of the Tbx2+ primary myocardium to the components of the definitive heart, genetic lineage tracing was performed using a novel Tbx2Cre allele. These analyses revealed that progeny of Tbx2+ cells provide an unexpectedly large contribution to the Tbx2-negative ventricles. Contrary to common assumption, we found that the embryonic left ventricle only forms the left part of the definitive ventricular septum and the apex. The atrioventricular node, but not the atrioventricular bundle, was found to derive from Tbx2+ cells. The Tbx2+ outflow tract formed the right ventricle and right part of the ventricular septum. In Tbx2-deficient embryos, the left-sided atrioventricular canal was found to prematurely differentiate to chamber myocardium and to proliferate at increased rates similar to those of chamber myocardium. As a result, the atrioventricular junction and base of the left ventricle were malformed. Together, these observations indicate that Tbx2 temporally suppresses differentiation and proliferation of primary myocardial cells. A subset of these Tbx2Cre-marked cells switch off expression of Tbx2, which allows them to differentiate into chamber myocardium, to initiate proliferation, and to provide a large contribution to the ventricles. These findings imply that errors in the development of the early atrioventricular canal may affect a much larger region than previously anticipated, including the ventricular base."
19481058,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Artemis regulates cell cycle recovery from the S phase checkpoint by promoting degradation of cyclin E.,"Artemis, a member of the SNM1 gene family, is a known phosphorylation target of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs. We have previously identified two serine residues in Artemis (Ser(516) and Ser(645)) that are subject to phosphorylation by ATM and are involved in mediating recovery from the G(2)/M checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation. Here we show that these same sites are also phosphorylated by ATR in response to various types of replication stress including UVC, aphidicolin, and hydroxyurea. We also show that mutation of the Ser(516) and Ser(645) residues causes a prolonged S phase checkpoint recovery after treatment with UV or aphidicolin, and that this delayed recovery process coincides with a prolonged stabilization of cyclin E and down-regulation of Cdk2 kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that Artemis interacts with the F-box protein Fbw7, and that this interaction regulates cyclin E degradation through the SCF(Fbw7) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The interaction between Artemis and Fbw7 is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser(516) and Ser(645) sites that occur in response to replication stress. Thus, our findings suggest a novel pathway of recovery from the S phase checkpoint in that in response to replication stress phosphorylation of Artemis by ATR enhances its interaction with Fbw7, which in turn promotes ubiquitylation and the ultimate degradation of cyclin E."
19481096,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Structure of the c14 rotor ring of the proton translocating chloroplast ATP synthase.,"The structure of the membrane integral rotor ring of the proton translocating F(1)F(0) ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts was determined to 3.8 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. The rotor ring consists of 14 identical protomers that are symmetrically arranged around a central pore. Comparisons with the c(11) rotor ring of the sodium translocating ATPase from Ilyobacter tartaricus show that the conserved carboxylates involved in proton or sodium transport, respectively, are 10.6-10.8 A apart in both c ring rotors. This finding suggests that both ATPases have the same gear distance despite their different stoichiometries. The putative proton-binding site at the conserved carboxylate Glu(61) in the chloroplast ATP synthase differs from the sodium-binding site in Ilyobacter. Residues adjacent to the conserved carboxylate show increased hydrophobicity and reduced hydrogen bonding. The crystal structure reflects the protonated form of the chloroplast c ring rotor. We propose that upon deprotonation, the conformation of Glu(61) is changed to another rotamer and becomes fully exposed to the periphery of the ring. Reprotonation of Glu(61) by a conserved arginine in the adjacent a subunit returns the carboxylate to its initial conformation."
19481453,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Bacterial toxin HigB associates with ribosomes and mediates translation-dependent mRNA cleavage at A-rich sites.,"Most pathogenic Proteus species are primarily associated with urinary tract infections, especially in persons with indwelling catheters or functional/anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract. Urinary tract infections caused by Proteus vulgaris typically form biofilms and are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The Rts1 conjugative plasmid from a clinical isolate of P. vulgaris carries over 300 predicted open reading frames, including antibiotic resistance genes. The maintenance of the Rts1 plasmid is ensured in part by the HigBA toxin-antitoxin system. We determined the precise mechanism of action of the HigB toxin in vivo, which is distinct from other known toxins. We demonstrate that HigB is an endoribonuclease whose enzymatic activity is dependent on association with ribosomes through the 50 S subunit. Using primer extension analysis of several test mRNAs, we showed that HigB cleaved extensively across the entire length of coding regions only at specific recognition sequences. HigB mediated cleavage of 100% of both in-frame and out-of-frame AAA sequences. In addition, HigB cleaved approximately 20% of AA sequences in coding regions and occasionally cut single As. Remarkably, the cleavage specificity of HigB coincided with one of the most frequently used codons in the AT-rich Proteus spp., AAA (lysine). Therefore, the HigB-mediated plasmid maintenance system for the Rts1 plasmid highlights the intimate relationship between host cells and extrachromosomal DNA that enables the dynamic acquisition of genes that impart a spectrum of survival advantages, including those encoding multidrug resistance and virulence factors."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,"The tail binds to the head-neck domain, inhibiting ATPase activity of myosin VIIA.","Myosin VIIA is an unconventional myosin, responsible for human Usher syndrome type 1B, which causes hearing and visual loss. Here, we studied the molecular mechanism of regulation of myosin VIIA, which is currently unknown. Although it was originally thought that myosin VIIA is a dimeric myosin, our electron microscopic (EM) observations revealed that full-length Drosophila myosin VIIA (DM7A) is a monomer. Interestingly, the tail domain markedly inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of tailless DM7A at low Ca(2+) but not high Ca(2+). By examining various deletion constructs, we found that deletion of the distal IQ domain, the C-terminal region of the tail, and the N-terminal region of the tail abolishes the tail-induced inhibition of ATPase activity. Single-particle EM analysis of full-length DM7A at low Ca(2+) suggests that the tail folds back on to the head, where it contacts both the motor core domain and the neck domain, forming an inhibited conformation. We concluded that unconventional myosin that may be present a monomer in the cell can be regulated by intramolecular interaction of the tail with the head."
19481521,1,DNA Res.,9423827,2009,Analysis of multiple occurrences of alternative splicing events in Arabidopsis thaliana using novel sequenced full-length cDNAs.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a mechanism by which multiple types of mature mRNAs are generated from a single pre-mature mRNA. In this study, we completely sequenced 1800 full-length cDNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana, which had 5' and/or 3' sequences that were previously found to have AS events or alternative transcription start sites. Unexpectedly, these sequences gave us further evidence of AS, as 601 out of 1800 transcripts showed novel AS events. We focused on the combination patterns of multiple AS events within individual genes. Interestingly, some specific AS event combination patterns tended to appear more frequently than expected. The two most common patterns were: (i) alternative donor-0 approximately 12 times of exon skips-alternative acceptor and (ii) several times ( approximately 8) of retained introns. We also found that multiple AS events in a transcript tend to have the same effects concerning the length of the mature mRNA. Our current results are consistent with our previous observations, which showed changes in AS profiles under different conditions, and suggest the involvement of hypothetical cis- and trans-acting factors in the regulation of AS events."

Commun.,372516,2009,MSCs guide neurite directional extension and promote oligodendrogenesis in NSCs.,"Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance repair following injury or degenerative diseases in the central nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated the functional relationship between MSCs and neural stem cells (NSCs) using co-culture systems. Results demonstrated that MSCs promoted outgrowth and guided directional extension of NSC-derived neurites. The majority of neurites were oriented parallel along the MSC axis. Stripe assay results indicated that cell adhesion molecule and extracellular matrix, such as N-cadherin, fibronectin, and laminin, contributed to this effect. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) increased during this process. In addition, MSCs promoted differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocytes via secreted soluble factors. The oligodendrocytes were distributed along the MSC surface in a regular pattern. This study demonstrated that MSC transplantation could be a potential strategy for treating central nervous system injuries."
19481526,1,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,372516,2009,Unexpected trafficking of immune cells within the adipose tissue during the onset of obesity.,"The primary inflammatory events occurring in the adipose tissue (AT) during high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity are poorly defined. The present study was undertaken to characterize, in wild-type(+/+) and lymphocyte deficient RAG2(-/-) mice under HFD, the changes in AT immune cells by flow cytometry analyses. In (+/+) mice, early accumulation of AT B-cells was observed, followed by increased AT T-cell numbers and finally by the appearance of insulin resistance and AT macrophage accumulation. Lack of lymphocytes in the RAG2(-/-) mice did not affect the onset of obesity and the state of insulin resistance. However, a striking accumulation of AT NK cells and activated macrophages was detected. The present study demonstrates that AT is the site of an unexpected dynamic in innate and adaptive cells during diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover it appears that early AT lymphocyte infiltration could be considered a protective process to temper adipose tissue inflammation."
19481534,0,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,Collagen mRNA levels changes during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive growth of epithelial cancers is a complex multi-step process which involves dissolution of the basement membrane. Type IV collagen is a major component in most basement membranes. Type VII collagen is related to anchoring fibrils and is found primarily in the basement membrane zone of stratified epithelia. Immunohistochemical studies have previously reported changes in steady-state levels of different alpha(IV) chains in several epithelial cancer types. In the present study we aimed to quantitatively determine the mRNA levels of type IV collagen (alpha1/alpha 4/alpha 6) and type VII collagen (alpha1) during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. METHODS: Using quantitative RT-PCR, we have determined the mRNA levels for alpha1(IV), alpha 4(IV), alpha 6(IV), and alpha1(VII) in colorectal cancer tissue (n = 33), adenomas (n = 29) and in normal tissue from the same individuals. In addition, corresponding tissue was examined from healthy volunteers (n = 20). mRNA levels were normalized to beta-actin. Immunohistochemical analysis of the distributions of type IV and type VII collagens were performed on normal and affected tissues from colorectal cancer patients. RESULTS: The alpha1(IV) and alpha1(VII) mRNA levels were statistically significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissue (p &lt; 0.001) as compared to corresponding tissue from healthy controls. This is an early event as tissue from adenomas also displayed a higher level. There were small changes in the levels of alpha 4(IV). The level of alpha 6(IV) was 5-fold lower in colorectal cancer tissue as compared to healthy individuals (p &lt; 0.01). The localisation of type IV and type VII collagen was visualized by immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the down-regulation of alpha 6(IV) mRNA coincides with the acquisition of invasive growth properties, whereas alpha1(IV) and alpha1(VII) mRNAs were up-regulated already in dysplastic tissue. There are no differences in collagen expression between tissues from healthy individuals and normal tissues from affected individuals."
19481774,0,BMC Bioinformatics,100965194,2009,On validation and invalidation of biological models.,"BACKGROUND: Very frequently the same biological system is described by several, sometimes competing mathematical models. This usually creates confusion around their validity, ie, which one is correct. However, this is unnecessary since validity of a model cannot be established; model validation is actually a misnomer. In principle the only statement that one can make about a system model is that it is incorrect, ie, invalid, a fact which can be established given appropriate experimental data. Nonlinear models of high dimension and with many parameters are impossible to invalidate through simulation and as such the invalidation process is often overlooked or ignored. RESULTS: We develop different approaches for showing how competing ordinary differential equation (ODE) based models of the same biological phenomenon containing nonlinearities and parametric uncertainty can be invalidated using experimental data. We first emphasize the strong interplay between system identification and model invalidation and we describe a method for obtaining a lower bound on the error between candidate model predictions and data. We then turn to model invalidation and formulate a methodology for discrete-time and continuous-time model invalidation. The methodology is algorithmic and uses Semidefinite Programming as the computational tool. It is emphasized that trying to invalidate complex nonlinear models through exhaustive simulation is not only computationally intractable but also inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Biological models derived from experimental data can never be validated. In fact, in order to understand biological function one should try to invalidate models that are incompatible with available data. This work describes a framework for invalidating both continuous and discrete-time ODE models based on convex optimization techniques. The methodology does not require any simulation of the candidate models; the algorithms presented in this paper have a worst case polynomial time complexity and can provide an exact answer to the invalidation problem."

Configurational entropies determined in dihedral angle space for each amino acid type are accurately parametrized in terms of arithmetically-averaged order parameters of selected N-H, C-H, and C-CH(3) vectors that are accessible by NMR spectroscopy. The resulting amino acid-specific relationships have high accuracy and provide a simple dictionary for the quantitative conversion of experimental NMR S(2) order parameters into the total configurational entropy and its changes. This dictionary overcomes important limitations of previous entropy estimates from NMR dynamics data."

An effective MMP-13 inhibitor would therefore be a novel disease modifying therapy for the treatment of arthritis. Our efforts have resulted in the discovery of a series of carboxylic acid inhibitors of MMP-13 that do not significantly inhibit the related MMP-1 (collagenase-1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) converting enzyme (TACE). It has previously been suggested (but not proven) that inhibition of the latter two enzymes could lead to side effects. A promising carboxylic acid lead 9 was identified and a convergent synthesis developed. This paper describes the optimization of 9 and the identification of a compound 24f for further development. Compound 24f is a subnanomolar inhibitor of MMP-13 (IC(50) value 0.5 nM and K(i) of 0.19 nM) having no activity against MMP-1 or TACE (IC(50) of &gt;10000 nM). Furthermore, in a rat model of MMP-13-induced cartilage degradation, 24f significantly reduced proteoglycan release following oral dosing at 30 mg/kg (75% inhibition, p &lt; 0.05) and at 10 mg/kg (40% inhibition, p &lt; 0.05)."
19482035,0,J. Med. Chem.,9716531,2009,Screening of small molecule interactor library by using in-cell NMR spectroscopy (SMILI-NMR).,We developed an in-cell NMR assay for screening small molecule interactor libraries (SMILI-NMR) for compounds capable of disrupting or enhancing specific interactions between two or more components of a biomolecular complex. The method relies on the formation of a well-defined biocomplex and utilizes in-cell NMR spectroscopy to identify the molecular surfaces involved in the interaction at atomic scale resolution. Changes in the interaction surface caused by a small molecule interfering with complex formation are used as a read-out of the assay. The in-cell nature of the experimental protocol insures that the small molecule is capable of penetrating the cell membrane and specifically engaging the target molecule(s). Utility of the method was demonstrated by screening a small dipeptide library against the FKBP-FRB protein complex involved in cell cycle arrest. The dipeptide identified by SMILI-NMR showed biological activity in a functional assay in yeast.
19482358,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Robust NMR screening for lead compounds using tryptophan-containing proteins.,"NMR-based drug screening methods provide the most reliable characterization of binding propensities of ligands to their target proteins. Unique to NMR is its capability to detect weak microM-mM bindings. NMR assays are, however, one of the least effective methods in terms of the amount of protein required and the time needed for acquiring NMR experiments. We have recently described a time efficient 1D proton NMR assay for studying the effect of antagonists on protein-protein interactions. The method, named AIDA-NMR (for Antagonist Induced Dissociation Assay-NMR), can provide information on whether an antagonist of a protein-protein interaction is strong enough to dissociate the complex and, in addition, whether its interaction is through denaturation, precipitation, or release of a protein in its functional folded state. AIDA requires a large protein fragment (larger than ca. 30 kDa) to bind to a small reporter protein (smaller than ca.12 kDa). Here, we present an extension of this method, named SEI AIDA (SEI, for Selective Excitation-Inversion). The SEI AIDA uses tryptophan-bearing proteins, and by selectively exciting only the proton NMR signals of the (N)H(epsilon) indole side chains of tryptophans, the acquisition time of the AIDA experiment can be reduced by an order of magnitude relative to the corresponding 1D AIDA that uses hard pulses. Thus, at 600 MHz, the (N)H(epsilon) signal of a 35 microM protein complex can be acquired in only 2.5 min, making the SEI AIDA suitable for high-throughput screening pipelines in drug discovery."
19482921,0,J. Am. Chem. Soc.,7503056,2009,Carbon dioxide and methane transport in DDR zeolite: insights from molecular simulations into carbon dioxide separations in small pore zeolites.,"The silica zeolite DDR is a strong candidate for separations of CO(2)/CH(4) because of the narrow windows that control molecular transport inside the material's pores. We have used molecular simulations to describe diffusion of CO(2) and CH(4) inside DDR pores. Our simulations introduce a new force-field for this system that for the first time gives results that are consistent with experimental measurements of single-component adsorption and diffusion. Diffusivities obtained from previous simulations greatly overestimated the transport rates of CH(4) and, to a lesser extent, CO(2). Because CH(4) diffuses extremely slowly in DDR, we applied a transition state theory-based kinetic Monte Carlo scheme to accurately describe this diffusion. The most important observation from our calculations is that the characteristics of CO(2)/CH(4) diffusion in DDR are very different from the usual situation in nanoporous materials, where the presence of a slowly diffusing species retards transport rates of a more rapidly diffusing species. In DDR, we show that CO(2) diffusion rates are only weakly affected by the presence of CH(4), despite the very slow diffusion of the latter molecules. The physical origins of this unusual behavior are explained by analyzing the adsorption sites and diffusion mechanism for each species. Our finding suggests DDR membranes are favorable for CO(2)/CH(4) separations and that similar properties may exist for other 8MR zeolites."

Invest.,7802877,2009,Anti-TNF immunotherapy and tuberculosis reactivation: another mechanism revealed.,"Anti-TNF immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of some inflammatory diseases, such as RA. However, a major concern is that patients receiving this therapy have an increased risk of fungal and bacterial infection, particularly of reactivating latent tuberculosis (TB). In this issue of the JCI, in an effort to understand how anti-TNF immunotherapy affects host mechanisms required to control TB, Bruns and colleagues examined the effects of the anti-TNF therapeutic infliximab on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific human lymphocytes (see the related article beginning on page 1167). The authors report that a granulysin-expressing CD45RA+ subset of effector memory CD8+ T cells that contributes to the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis is depleted in vivo by infliximab in patients with RA, and that these cells are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis in the presence of infliximab in vitro. The study provides insight into host defense mechanisms that act to control TB infection and how they are affected during anti-TNF immunotherapy for autoimmune disease."
19483084,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,Crucial role for BAFF-BAFF-R signaling in the survival and maintenance of mature B cells.,"Defects in the expression of either BAFF (B cell activating factor) or BAFF-R impairs B cell development beyond the immature, transitional type-1 stage and thus, prevents the formation of follicular and marginal zone B cells, whereas B-1 B cells remain unaffected. The expression of BAFF-R on all mature B cells might suggest a role for BAFF-R signaling also for their in vivo maintenance. Here, we show that, 14 days following a single injection of an anti-BAFF-R mAb that prevents BAFF binding, both follicular and marginal zone B cell numbers are drastically reduced, whereas B-1 cells are not affected. Injection of control, isotype-matched but non-blocking anti-BAFF-R mAbs does not result in B cell depletion. We also show that this depletion is neither due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity nor to complement-mediated lysis. Moreover, prevention of BAFF binding leads to a decrease in the size of the B cell follicles, an impairment of a T cell dependent humoral immune response and a reduction in the formation of memory B cells. Collectively, these results establish a central role for BAFF-BAFF-R signaling in the in vivo survival and maintenance of both follicular and marginal zone B cell pools."
19483196,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2009,A tale of four &quot;carp&quot;: invasion potential and ecological niche modeling.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive species are a serious problem in ecosystems, but are difficult to eradicate once established. Predictive methods can be key in determining which areas are of concern regarding invasion by such species to prevent establishment [1]. We assessed the geographic potential of four Eurasian cyprinid fishes (common carp, tench, grass carp, black carp) as invaders in North America via ecological niche modeling (ENM). These &quot;carp&quot; represent four stages of invasion of the continent (a long-established invader with a wide distribution, a long-established invader with a limited distribution, a spreading invader whose distribution is expanding, and a newly introduced potential invader that is not yet established), and as such illustrate the progressive reduction of distributional disequilibrium over the history of species' invasions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used ENM to estimate the potential distributional area for each species in North America using models based on native range distribution data. Environmental data layers for native and introduced ranges were imported from state, national, and international climate and environmental databases. Models were evaluated using independent validation data on native and invaded areas. We calculated omission error for the independent validation data for each species: all native range tests were highly successful (all omission values &lt;7%); invaded-range predictions were predictive for common and grass carp (omission values 8.8 and 19.8%, respectively). Model omission was high for introduced tench populations (54.7%), but the model correctly identified some areas where the species has been successful; distributional predictions for black carp show that large portions of eastern North America are at risk. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: ENMs predicted potential ranges of carp species accurately even in regions where the species have not been present until recently. ENM can forecast species' potential geographic ranges with reasonable precision and within the short screening time required by proposed U.S. invasive species legislation."
19483197,1,Genes Immun.,100953417,2009,Multiple sclerosis associates with LILRA3 deletion in Spanish patients.,"The genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is only partially explained, and it shows geographic variations. We analyse here two series of Spanish patients and healthy controls and show that relapsing MS (R-MS) is associated with a gene deletion affecting the hypothetically soluble leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor A3 (LILRA3, 19q13.4), in agreement with an earlier finding in German patients. Our study points to a gene-dose-dependent, protective role for LILRA3, the deletion of which synergizes with HLA-DRB1(*)1501 to increase the risk of R-MS. We also investigated whether the risk of suffering R-MS might be influenced by the genotypic diversity of killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs), located only approximately 400 kb telomeric to LILRA3, and implicated in autoimmunity and defence against viruses. The relationship of LILRA3 deletion with R-MS is not secondary to linkage disequilibrium with a KIR gene, but we cannot exclude some contributions of KIR to the genetic susceptibility to R-MS."

In the present study, a N-terminally His-tagged recombinant form of the enzyme, OxtA(H)(E), was overproduced in Escherichia coli and applied to the reaction with xylan and hydroquinone to produce 4-hydroxyphenyl beta-D-oligoxylosides, beta-(Xyl)(n)-HQ (n=1-4), by one step reaction. The obtained beta-(Xyl)(n)-HQ inhibited mushroom tyrosinase, which catalyzes the oxidation of L-DOPA to L-DOPA quinine, and the IC(50) values of beta-Xyl-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(2)-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(3)-HQ, and beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ were 3.0, 0.74, 0.48, and 0.18 mM respectively. beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ showed 35-fold more potent inhibitory activity than beta-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), of which the IC(50) value was measured to be 6.3 mM. Kinetic analysis revealed that beta-(Xyl)(2)-HQ, beta-(Xyl)(3)-HQ, and beta-(Xyl)(4)-HQ competitively inhibited the enzyme, and the corresponding K(i) values were calculated to be 0.20, 0.29, and 0.057 mM respectively."
19483688,0,Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.,9205717,2009,Construction of flocculent Kluyveromyces marxianus strains suitable for high-temperature ethanol fermentation.,"Flocculating yeasts are highly useful in fermentation processes because these cells can be separated easily from the fermentation mash. However, native yeasts are usually non-flocculating, including Kluyveromyces marxianus, which exhibits a potent high-temperature ethanol fermentation ability. We describe here the construction of flocculent K. marxianus strains via the introduction of the FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10 genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae FLO genes were overexpressed by upstream insertion of the constitutive TDH3 promoter, resulting in flocculent S. cerevisiae strains. These TDH3p-FLO sequences were then amplified by PCR and introduced directly into a K. marxianus strain. These K. marxianus strains showed a flocculation phenotype, indicating that the introduced S. cerevisiae TDH3 promoter and all FLO genes were functional in this strain. Moreover, a flocculating K. marxianus strain showed the same ethanol production profile as that of its wild-type parent. The K. marxianus flocculating strains we generated should be useful in the future development of cost-effective fed-batch and continuous fermentation systems at high temperatures."
19483691,0,Genome Res.,9518021,2009,High-throughput genotyping by whole-genome resequencing.,"The next-generation sequencing technology coupled with the growing number of genome sequences opens the opportunity to redesign genotyping strategies for more effective genetic mapping and genome analysis. We have developed a high-throughput method for genotyping recombinant populations utilizing whole-genome resequencing data generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer. A sliding window approach is designed to collectively examine genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms for genotype calling and recombination breakpoint determination. Using this method, we constructed a genetic map for 150 rice recombinant inbred lines with an expected genotype calling accuracy of 99.94% and a resolution of recombination breakpoints within an average of 40 kb. In comparison to the genetic map constructed with 287 PCR-based markers for the rice population, the sequencing-based method was approximately 20x faster in data collection and 35x more precise in recombination breakpoint determination. Using the sequencing-based genetic map, we located a quantitative trait locus of large effect on plant height in a 100-kb region containing the rice &quot;green revolution&quot; gene. Through computer simulation, we demonstrate that the method is robust for different types of mapping populations derived from organisms with variable quality of genome sequences and is feasible for organisms with large genome sizes and low polymorphisms. With continuous advances in sequencing technologies, this genome-based method may replace the conventional marker-based genotyping approach to provide a powerful tool for large-scale gene discovery and for addressing a wide range of biological questions."
19483694,0,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,PI3K/Akt pathway mutations in retinoblastoma.,"PURPOSE: Many malignancies are known to be associated with abnormal activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Recently, a somatic mutation in the AKT1 gene (E17K) was identified in a small proportion of human tumors. This mutation activated AKT1 by means of abnormal membrane recruitment and stimulated downstream signaling. This study was designed to analyze AKT1 mutations in retinoblastoma and gain insights into the role PI3K-AKT pathway plays in the development of this tumor. METHODS: Twenty-four samples of retinoblastoma from children were analyzed for mutations in the AKT1, PTEN and K-RAS genes, using a chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. Mutations in the PIK3CA gene were analyzed in 16 retinoblastoma samples using direct sequencing. RESULTS: These results show that the mutation E17K/AKT1 was not detected in the 24 samples of retinoblastoma analyzed. K-RAS mutations were identified in two samples. There were no mutations in any of the other genes analyzed by a mass array system. On direct sequencing of 16 samples for the PIK3CA gene, one sample showed gain of function mutation in exon 9. In another sample, a genetic polymorphism of unknown significance (rs17849079) was detected in exon 20. CONCLUSIONS: Although the PI3K-AKT pathway is known to be dysregulated in retinoblastoma, the low frequency of oncogenic mutations in the AKT1, PIK3CA, and PTEN genes, suggests a different activating mechanism."
19483724,0,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Stimulus-evoked intrinsic optical signals in the retina: spatial and temporal characteristics.,"PURPOSE: To characterize the properties of stimulus-evoked retinal intrinsic signals and determine the underlying origins. METHODS: Seven adult cats were anesthetized and paralyzed to maximize imaging stability. The retina was stimulated with a liquid crystal display (LCD) integrated into a modified fundus camera (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). The LCD presented patterned visual stimuli while the retina was illuminated with near infrared (NIR) light. The peristimulus changes in the NIR reflectance of the retina were recorded with a digital camera. RESULTS: Two stimulus-evoked reflectance signals in the NIR were observed: a positive signal, corresponding to a relative increase in reflectance, and a negative signal, corresponding to a relative decrease in reflectance. When presented with a positive-contrast stimulus, the negative reflectance signals showed a tight spatial coupling with the stimulated region of retina, whereas the positive signals arose in an adjacent region of the retina. Signals remained spatially confined to the stimulated region even when stimuli of much longer duration were used. In addition, the positive and negative signal polarities reversed when the stimulus contrast was inverted. Both signals showed a rise time on the order of seconds, similar to those observed in the mammalian neocortex. The spectral dependency of the signals on illumination was similar to the absorbance spectra of hemoglobin and the oximetric relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The findings characterize the basic properties of stimulus-evoked intrinsic signals of the retina. These signals were generally similar to the more extensively studied cortical signals. Collectively, the data suggest a hemodynamic component to the intrinsic optical signals of the retina."
19483727,1,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2009,Poor postural stability in children with vertigo and vergence abnormalities.,"PURPOSE: An earlier study suggested that deficits of vergence can influence postural control via the efferent and afferent proprioceptive signals. In this study, postural control in 28 children with vertigo with normal vestibular function but with vergence abnormalities and in 19 normal children of comparable age was assessed with orthoptic tests. METHODS: A posturography platform was used to examine posture in quiet stance. The child was asked to fixate a target at 40 cm or at 200 cm, either with eyes open (vision condition) or with eyes covered by a black mask (no vision condition). In a complementary test in 15 of 28 children with vertigo and in all 19 normal children, postural control was evaluated during monocular viewing (dominant and nondominant eye viewing). RESULTS: For all children examined, postural stability was better when fixating a target at near than at far distance and with both eyes than with one eye or with eyes covered. In all conditions, the children with vertigo were more unstable than were the control children. CONCLUSIONS: Binocular visual information, such as vergence disparity, is essential in stabilizing posture at near distance. Postural instability reported in children with vertigo and vergence abnormalities could be due to poor vergence inputs and/or to immature compensatory mechanisms controlling postural stability (vestibular, somatosensory inputs and/or cerebellar processes)."
19484125,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2009,Abscisic acid negatively regulates elicitor-induced synthesis of capsidiol in wild tobacco.,"In the Solanaceae, biotic and abiotic elicitors induce de novo synthesis of sesquiterpenoid stress metabolites known as phytoalexins. Because plant hormones play critical roles in the induction of defense-responsive genes, we have explored the effect of abscisic acid (ABA) on the synthesis of capsidiol, the major wild tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin, using wild-type plants versus nonallelic mutants Npaba2 and Npaba1 that are deficient in ABA synthesis. Npaba2 and Npaba1 mutants exhibited a 2-fold higher synthesis of capsidiol than wild-type plants when elicited with either cellulase or arachidonic acid or when infected by Botrytis cinerea. The same trend was observed for the expression of the capsidiol biosynthetic genes 5-epi-aristolochene synthase and 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase. Treatment of wild-type plants with fluridone, an inhibitor of the upstream ABA pathway, recapitulated the behavior of Npaba2 and Npaba1 mutants, while the application of exogenous ABA reversed the enhanced synthesis of capsidiol in Npaba2 and Npaba1 mutants. Concomitant with the production of capsidiol, we observed the induction of ABA 8'-hydroxylase in elicited plants. In wild-type plants, the induction of ABA 8'-hydroxylase coincided with a decrease in ABA content and with the accumulation of ABA catabolic products such as phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid, suggesting a negative regulation exerted by ABA on capsidiol synthesis. Collectively, our data indicate that ABA is not required per se for the induction of capsidiol synthesis but is essentially implicated in a stress-response checkpoint to fine-tune the amplification of capsidiol synthesis in challenged plants."
19485418,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Dopaminergic response to drug words in cocaine addiction.,"When exposed to drug conditioned cues (stimuli associated with the drug), addicted individuals experience an intense desire for the drug, which is associated with increased dopamine cell firing. We hypothesized that drug-related words can trigger activation in the mesencephalon, where dopaminergic cells are located. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15 individuals with cocaine use disorders and 15 demographically matched healthy control subjects pressed buttons for color of drug-related versus neutral words. Results showed that the drug words, but not neutral words, activated the mesencephalon in the cocaine users only. Further, in the cocaine users only, these increased drug-related mesencephalic responses were associated with enhanced verbal fluency specifically for drug words. Our results for the first time demonstrate fMRI response to drug words in cocaine-addicted individuals in mesencephalic regions as possibly associated with dopaminergic mechanisms and with conditioning to language (in this case drug words). The correlation between the brief verbal fluency test, which can be easily administered (crucial for clinical studies), and fMRI cue reactivity could be used as a biomarker of neurobiological changes in addiction."
19486660,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,The basal forebrain cholinergic system is required specifically for behaviorally mediated cortical map plasticity.,"The basal forebrain cholinergic system has been implicated in the reorganization of adult cortical sensory and motor representations under many, but not all, experimental conditions. It is still not fully understood which types of plasticity require the cholinergic system and which do not. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that the basal forebrain cholinergic system is required for eliciting plasticity associated with complex cognitive processing (e.g., behavioral experiences that drive cortical reorganization) but is not required for plasticity mediated under behaviorally independent conditions. We used established experimental manipulations to elicit two distinct forms of plasticity within the motor cortex: facial nerve transections evoke reorganization of cortical motor representations independent of behavioral experience, and skilled forelimb training induces behaviorally dependent expansion of forelimb motor representations. In animals that underwent skilled forelimb training in conjunction with a facial nerve lesion, cholinergic mechanisms were required for mediating the behaviorally dependent plasticity associated with the skilled motor training but were not necessary for mediating plasticity associated with the facial nerve transection. These results dissociate the contribution of cholinergic mechanisms to distinct forms of cortical plasticity and support the hypothesis that the forebrain cholinergic system is selectively required for modulating complex forms of cortical plasticity driven by behavioral experience."
19486667,0,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Tuberous sclerosis complex activity is required to control neuronal stress responses in an mTOR-dependent manner.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and frequently results in prominent CNS manifestations, including epilepsy, mental retardation, and autism spectrum disorder. The TSC1/TSC2 protein complex plays a major role in controlling the Ser/Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a master regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. In this study, we show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulates TSC1/TSC2 complex to limit mTOR activity. In addition, Tsc2-deficient rat hippocampal neurons and brain lysates from a Tsc1-deficient mouse model demonstrate both elevated ER and oxidative stress. In Tsc2-deficient neurons, the expression of stress markers such as CHOP and HO-1 is increased, and this increase is completely reversed by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin both in vitro and in vivo. Neurons lacking a functional TSC1/TSC2 complex have increased vulnerability to ER stress-induced cell death via the activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Importantly, knockdown of CHOP reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis in Tsc2-deficient neurons. These observations indicate that ER stress modulates mTOR activity through the TSC protein complex and that ER stress is elevated in cells lacking this complex. They also suggest that some of the neuronal dysfunction and neurocognitive deficits seen in TSC patients may be attributable to ER and oxidative stress and therefore potentially responsive to agents moderating these pathways."
19486684,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Direct control of peripheral lipid deposition by CNS GLP-1 receptor signaling is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and blunted in diet-induced obesity.,"We investigated a possible role of the central glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor system as an essential brain circuit regulating adiposity through effects on nutrient partitioning and lipid metabolism independent from feeding behavior. Both lean and diet-induced obesity mice were used for our experiments. GLP-1 (7-36) amide was infused in the brain for 2 or 7 d. The expression of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism was measured by real-time PCR or Western blot. To test the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system may be responsible for informing adipocytes about changes in CNS GLP-1 tone, we have performed direct recording of sympathetic nerve activity combined with experiments in genetically manipulated mice lacking beta-adrenergic receptors. Intracerebroventricular infusion of GLP-1 in mice directly and potently decreases lipid storage in white adipose tissue. These effects are independent from nutrient intake. Such CNS control of adipocyte metabolism was found to depend partially on a functional sympathetic nervous system. Furthermore, the effects of CNS GLP-1 on adipocyte metabolism were blunted in diet-induced obese mice. The CNS GLP-1 system decreases fat storage via direct modulation of adipocyte metabolism. This CNS GLP-1 control of adipocyte lipid metabolism appears to be mediated at least in part by the sympathetic nervous system and is independent of parallel changes in food intake and body weight. Importantly, the CNS GLP-1 system loses the capacity to modulate adipocyte metabolism in obese states, suggesting an obesity-induced adipocyte resistance to CNS GLP-1."
19486883,1,J. Neurosci.,8102140,2009,Wnt5a induces simultaneous cortical axon outgrowth and repulsive axon guidance through distinct signaling mechanisms.,"Wnts are morphogens that also function as axon guidance molecules. In vivo Wnt5a gradients via Ryk receptors were found to repel cortical axons into developing callosal and corticospinal pathways. Here, using dissociated cortical cultures, we found that bath-applied Wnt5a increased axon outgrowth. In turning assays, Wnt5a gradients simultaneously increased axon outgrowth and induced repulsive turning, a potential mechanism for propelling cortical axons in vivo. We found that axon outgrowth is mediated by Ryk, whereas axon repulsion requires both Ryk and Frizzled receptors. Both receptors mediate Wnt-evoked fluctuations in intracellular calcium, which is required for increased axon outgrowth and repulsion by Wnt5a. However, whereas increased axon outgrowth involves calcium release from stores through IP3 receptors as well as calcium influx through TRP channels, axon repulsion is mediated by TRP channels without involvement of IP3 receptors. These results reveal distinct signaling mechanisms underlying Wnt5a-induced axon outgrowth and repulsive guidance."
19486891,1,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,IC138 defines a subdomain at the base of the I1 dynein that regulates microtubule sliding and flagellar motility.,"To understand the mechanisms that regulate the assembly and activity of flagellar dyneins, we focused on the I1 inner arm dynein (dynein f) and a null allele, bop5-2, defective in the gene encoding the IC138 phosphoprotein subunit. I1 dynein assembles in bop5-2 axonemes but lacks at least four subunits: IC138, IC97, LC7b, and flagellar-associated protein (FAP) 120--defining a new I1 subcomplex. Electron microscopy and image averaging revealed a defect at the base of the I1 dynein, in between radial spoke 1 and the outer dynein arms. Microtubule sliding velocities also are reduced. Transformation with wild-type IC138 restores assembly of the IC138 subcomplex and rescues microtubule sliding. These observations suggest that the IC138 subcomplex is required to coordinate I1 motor activity. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed microtubule sliding in radial spoke and double mutant strains. The results reveal an essential role for the IC138 subcomplex in the regulation of I1 activity by the radial spoke/phosphorylation pathway."
19486897,0,Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.,100901990,2009,Expression of the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR in ischemia-reperfusion injury of rat kidney.,"The RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) participates in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNAs bearing 3' AU-rich and U-rich elements, which HuR can stabilize under conditions of cellular stress. Using the LLC-PK(1) proximal tubule cell line model, we recently suggested a role for HuR in protecting kidney epithelia from injury during ischemic stress (Jeyaraj S, Dakhlallah D, Hill SR, Lee BS. J Biol Chem 280: 37957-37964, 2005; Jeyaraj SC, Dakhlallah D, Hill SR, Lee BS. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 291: F1255-F1263, 2006). Here, we have extended this work to show that small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of HuR in LLC-PK(1) cells increased apoptosis during energy depletion, while overexpression of HuR diminished apoptosis. Suppression of HuR also resulted in diminished levels of key cell survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Hsp70. Furthermore, rat kidneys were subjected in vivo to transient ischemia followed by varying periods of reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) affected intensity and distribution of HuR in a nephron segment-specific manner. Cells of the proximal tubule, which are most sensitive to I/R injury, demonstrated a transient shift of HuR to the cytoplasm immediately following ischemia. Over a 14-day period following the onset of reperfusion, nuclear and total HuR protein gradually increased in cortical and medullary proximal tubules, but not in non-proximal tubule cells. HuR mRNA was expressed in two forms with alternate transcriptional start sites that increased over a 14-day I/R period, and in vitro studies suggest selective translatability of these two mRNAs. Baseline and I/R-stimulated levels of HuR mRNA did not parallel those of HuR protein, suggesting translational control of HuR expression, particularly in medullary proximal tubules. These findings suggest that alterations in distribution and expression of the antiaptotic protein HuR specifically in cells of the proximal tubule effect a protective mechanism during and following I/R injury in kidney."
19487289,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Syk tyrosine 317 negatively regulates osteoclast function via the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of Cbl.,"Cytoskeletal organization of the osteoclast (OC), which is central to the capacity of the cell to resorb bone, is induced by occupancy of the alphavbeta3 integrin or the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor c-Fms. In both circumstances, the tyrosine kinase Syk is an essential signaling intermediary. We demonstrate that Cbl negatively regulates OC function by interacting with Syk(Y317). Expression of nonphosphorylatable Syk(Y317F) in primary Syk(-/-) OCs enhances M-CSF- and alphavbeta3-induced phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton-organizing molecules, SLP76, Vav3, and PLCgamma2, to levels greater than wild type, thereby accelerating the resorptive capacity of the cell. Syk(Y317) suppresses cytoskeletal organization and function while binding the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Cbl. Consequently, Syk(Y317F) abolishes M-CSF- and integrin-stimulated Syk ubiquitination. Thus, Cbl/Syk(Y317) association negatively regulates OC function and therefore is essential for maintenance of skeletal homeostasis."

The prototype of these conditions is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Bruton's disease. XLA is caused by mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene (BTK), preventing B cell development and resulting in the almost total absence of serum immunoglobulins. The genetic profile and prevalence of XLA have not previously been studied in Eastern and Central European (ECE) countries. We studied the genetic and demographic features of XLA in Belarus, Croatia Hungary, Poland, Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We collected clinical, immunological, and genetic information for 122 patients from 109 families. The BTK gene was sequenced from the genomic DNA of patients with a high susceptibility to infection, almost no CD19(+) peripheral blood B cells, and low or undetectable levels of serum immunoglobulins M, G, and A, compatible with a clinical and immunological diagnosis of XLA. BTK sequence analysis revealed 98 different mutations, 46 of which are reported for the first time here. The mutations included single nucleotide changes in the coding exons (35 missense and 17 nonsense), 23 splicing defects, 13 small deletions, 7 large deletions, and 3 insertions. The mutations were scattered throughout the BTK gene and most frequently concerned the SH1 domain; no missense mutation was detected in the SH3 domain. The prevalence of XLA in ECE countries (total population 145,530,870) was found to be 1 per 1,399,000 individuals. This report provides the first comprehensive overview of the molecular genetic and demographic features of XLA in Eastern and Central Europe."

To deepen our knowledge of cellular transcription, we have determined the structure of the 13-subunit DNA-directed RNAP from Sulfolobus shibatae at 3.35 A resolution. The structure contains the full complement of subunits, including RpoG/Rpb8 and the equivalent of the clamp-head and jaw domains of the eukaryotic Rpb1. Furthermore, we have identified subunit Rpo13, an RNAP component in the order Sulfolobales, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts with the RpoH/Rpb5 and RpoA'/Rpb1 subunits. Its location and topology suggest a role in the formation of the transcription bubble."

Soc.,7503056,2009,Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan tertiary structure from carbon-13 spin diffusion.,"The cell-wall peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus is a heterogeneous, highly cross-linked polymer of unknown tertiary structure. We have partially characterized this structure by measuring spin diffusion from (13)C labels in pentaglycyl cross-linking segments to natural-abundance (13)C in the surrounding intact cell walls. The measurements were performed using a version of centerband-only detection of exchange (CODEX). The cell walls were isolated from S. aureus grown in media containing [1-(13)C]glycine. The CODEX spin diffusion rates established that the pentaglycyl bridge of one peptidoglycan repeat unit of S. aureus is within 5 A of the glycan chain of another repeat unit. This surprising proximity is interpreted in terms of a model for the peptidoglycan lattice in which all peptide stems in a plane perpendicular to the glycan mainchain are parallel to one another."

Colonic mucosa of collagenous colitis is known to be endoscopically normal. We present a case of collagenous colitis where the mucosa showed diffuse cloudiness mimicking ulcerative colitis. A 70-year-old woman developed watery diarrhea four to nine times a day. She had interstitial pneumonia at 67 and reflux esophagitis at 70 years. Lansoprazole 30 mg/d had been prescribed for reflux esophagitis for nearly 6 mo. Lansoprazole was withdrawn due to its possible side effect of diarrhea. Colonoscopy disclosed diffuse cloudiness of the mucosa which suggested ulcerative colitis. Consequently sulfasalazine 2 g/d was started. The patient's diarrhea dramatically disappeared on the following day. However, biopsy specimens showed subepithelial collagenous thickening and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, confirming the diagnosis of collagenous colitis. One month after sulfasalazine therapy was initiated, colonoscopic and histological abnormalities resolved completely. Five months later the diarrhea recurred. The findings on colonoscopy and histology were the same as before, confirming a diagnosis of collagenous colitis relapse. We found that the patient had begun to take lansoprazole again 3 mo ahead of the recent diarrhea. Withdrawal of lansoprazole promptly resolved the diarrhea. Endoscopic and histological abnormalities were also completely resolved, similar to the first episode. Retrospectively, the date of commencement of sulfasalazine and discontinuation of lansoprazole in the first episode was found to be the same. We conclude that this patient had lansoprazole-associated collagenous colitis."

Gastroenterol.,100883448,2009,High miR-196a levels promote the oncogenic phenotype of colorectal cancer cells.,"AIM: To analyze the relevance of the microRNA miR-196a for colorectal oncogenesis. METHODS: The impact of miR-196a on the restriction targets HoxA7, HoxB8, HoxC8 and HoxD8 was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after transient transfection of SW480 cancer cells. The miR-196a transcription profile in colorectal cancer samples, mucosa samples and diverse cancer cell lines was quantified by RT-PCR. Transiently miR-196a-transfected colorectal cancer cells were used for diverse functional assays in vitro and for a xenograft lung metastasis model in vivo. RESULTS: HoxA7, HoxB8, HoxC8 and HoxD8 were restricted by miR-196a in a dose-dependent and gene-specific manner. High levels of miR-196a activated the AKT signaling pathway as indicated by increased phosphorylation of AKT. In addition, high levels of miR-196a promoted cancer cell detachment, migration, invasion and chemosensitivity towards platin derivatives but did not impact on proliferation or apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-196a increased the development of lung metastases in mice after tail vein injection. CONCLUSION: miR-196a exerts a pro-oncogenic influence in colorectal cancer."

We show that injection of human or zebrafish EWSR1/FLI1 mRNA into developing zebrafish embryos leads to mitotic defects with multipolar and disorganized mitotic spindles. Expression of human EWSR1/FLI1 in HeLa cells also results in mitotic defects, along with mislocalization of Aurora kinase B, a key regulator of mitotic progression. Because these mitotic abnormalities mimic those observed with the knockdown of EWSR1 in zebrafish embryos and HeLa cells, we investigated whether EWSR1/FLI1 interacts with EWSR1 and interferes with its function. EWSR1 coimmunoprecipitates with EWSR1/FLI1, and overexpression of EWSR1 rescues the mitotic defects in EWSR1/FLI1-transfected HeLa cells. This interaction between EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1 in Ewing sarcoma may induce mitotic defects leading to genomic instability and subsequent malignant transformation."

Here, we demonstrate that crescentin also shares in vivo properties of assembly and dynamics with IF proteins by forming stable filamentous structures that continuously incorporate subunits along their length and that grow in a nonpolar fashion. De novo assembly of crescentin is biphasic and involves a cell size-dependent mechanism that controls the length of the structure by favoring lateral insertion of crescentin subunits over bipolar longitudinal extension when the structure ends reach the cell poles. The crescentin structure is stably anchored to the cell envelope, and this cellular organization requires MreB function, identifying a new function for MreB and providing a parallel to the role of actin in IF assembly and organization in metazoan cells. Additionally, analysis of an MreB localization mutant suggests that cell wall insertion during cell elongation normally occurs along two helices of opposite handedness, each counterbalancing the other's torque."

Genet.,9208958,2009,Otoferlin interacts with myosin VI: implications for maintenance of the basolateral synaptic structure of the inner hair cell.,"Otoferlin has been proposed to be the Ca(2+) sensor in hair cell exocytosis, compensating for the classical synaptic fusion proteins synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-2. In the present study, yeast two-hybrid assays reveal myosin VI as a novel otoferlin binding partner. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and co-expression suggest an interaction of both proteins within the basolateral part of inner hair cells (IHCs). Comparison of otoferlin mutants and myosin VI mutant mice indicates non-complementary and complementary roles of myosin VI and otoferlin for synaptic maturation: (i) IHCs from otoferlin mutant mice exhibited a decoupling of CtBP2/RIBEYE and Ca(V)1.3 and severe reduction of exocytosis. (ii) Myosin VI mutant IHCs failed to transport BK channels to the membrane of the apical cell regions, and the exocytotic Ca(2+) efficiency did not mature. (iii) Otoferlin and myosin VI mutant IHCs showed a reduced basolateral synaptic surface area and altered active zone topography. Membrane infoldings in otoferlin mutant IHCs indicated disturbed transport of endocytotic membranes and link the above morphological changes to a complementary role of otoferlin and myosin VI in transport of intracellular compartments to the basolateral IHC membrane."

Although GBs have been exhaustively investigated at low temperatures, at which these regions are relatively ordered, much less is known about them at higher temperatures, where they exhibit significant mobility and structural disorder and characterization methods are limited. The time and spatial scales accessible to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are appropriate for investigating the dynamical and structural properties of GBs at elevated temperatures, and we exploit MD to explore basic aspects of GB dynamics as a function of temperature. It has long been hypothesized that GBs have features in common with glass-forming liquids based on the processing characteristics of polycrystalline materials. We find remarkable support for this suggestion, as evidenced by string-like collective atomic motion and transient caging of atomic motion, and a non-Arrhenius GB mobility describing the average rate of large-scale GB displacement."

Here, the in vivo enzyme-substrate interaction of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAP kinase, MPK6, with an ethylene response factor (ERF104) is shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The interaction was rapidly lost in response to flagellin-derived flg22 peptide. This complex disruption requires not only MPK6 activity, which also affects ERF104 stability via phosphorylation, but also ethylene signaling. The latter points to a novel role of ethylene in substrate release, presumably allowing the liberated ERF104 to access target genes. Microarray data show enrichment of GCC motifs in the promoters of ERF104-up-regulated genes, many of which are stress related. ERF104 is a vital regulator of basal immunity, as altered expression in both erf104 and overexpressors led to more growth inhibition by flg22 and enhanced susceptibility to a non-adapted bacterial pathogen."
19489577,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Design of anti- and pro-aggregation variants to assess the effects of methionine oxidation in human prion protein.,"Prion disease is characterized by the alpha--&gt;beta structural conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into the misfolded and aggregated &quot;scrapie&quot; (PrP(Sc)) isoform. It has been speculated that methionine (Met) oxidation in PrP(C) may have a special role in this process, but has not been detailed and assigned individually to the 9 Met residues of full-length, recombinant human PrP(C) [rhPrP(C)(23-231)]. To better understand this oxidative event in PrP aggregation, the extent of periodate-induced Met oxidation was monitored by electrospray ionization-MS and correlated with aggregation propensity. Also, the Met residues were replaced with isosteric and chemically stable, nonoxidizable analogs, i.e., with the more hydrophobic norleucine (Nle) and the highly hydrophilic methoxinine (Mox). The Nle-rhPrP(C) variant is an alpha-helix rich protein (like Met-rhPrP(C)) resistant to oxidation that lacks the in vitro aggregation properties of the parent protein. Conversely, the Mox-rhPrP(C) variant is a beta-sheet rich protein that features strong proaggregation behavior. In contrast to the parent Met-rhPrP(C), the Nle/Mox-containing variants are not sensitive to periodate-induced in vitro aggregation. The experimental results fully support a direct correlation of the alpha--&gt;beta secondary structure conversion in rhPrP(C) with the conformational preferences of Met/Nle/Mox residues. Accordingly, sporadic prion and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as various aging processes, might also be caused by oxidative stress leading to Met oxidation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,A chemical screen for biological small molecule-RNA conjugates reveals CoA-linked RNA.,"Compared with the rapidly expanding set of known biological roles for RNA, the known chemical diversity of cellular RNA has remained limited primarily to canonical RNA, 3'-aminoacylated tRNAs, nucleobase-modified RNAs, and 5'-capped mRNAs in eukaryotes. We developed two methods to detect in a broad manner chemically labile cellular small molecule-RNA conjugates. The methods were validated by the detection of known tRNA and rRNA modifications. The first method analyzes small molecules cleaved from RNA by base or nucleophile treatment. Application to Escherichia coli and Streptomyces venezuelae RNA revealed an RNA-linked hydroxyfuranone or succinyl ester group, in addition to a number of other putative small molecule-RNA conjugates not previously reported. The second method analyzes nuclease-generated mononucleotides before and after treatment with base or nucleophile and also revealed a number of new putative small molecule-RNA conjugates, including 3'-dephospho-CoA and its succinyl-, acetyl-, and methylmalonyl-thioester derivatives. Subsequent experiments established that these CoA species are attached to E. coli and S. venezuelae RNA at the 5' terminus. CoA-linked RNA cannot be generated through aberrant transcriptional initiation by E. coli RNA polymerase in vitro, and CoA-linked RNA in E. coli is only found among smaller (approximately &lt; 200 nucleotide) RNAs that have yet to be identified. These results provide examples of small molecule-RNA conjugates and suggest that the chemical diversity of cellular RNA may be greater than previously understood."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Functional electric field changes in photoactivated proteins revealed by ultrafast Stark spectroscopy of the Trp residues.,"Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin (WT bR) and 2 tryptophan mutants (W86F and W182F) is performed with visible light excitation (pump) and UV probe. The aim is to investigate the photoinduced change in the charge distribution with 50-fs time resolution by probing the effects on the tryptophan absorption bands. A systematic, quantitative comparison of the transient absorption of the 3 samples is carried out. The main result is the absence in the W86F mutant of a transient induced absorption band observed at approximately 300-310 nm in WT bR and W182F. A simple model describing the dipolar interaction of the retinal moiety with the 2 tryptophan residues of interest allows us to reproduce the dominant features of the transient signals observed in the 3 samples at ultrashort pump-probe delays. In particular, we show that Trp(86) undergoes a significant Stark shift induced by the transient retinal dipole moment. The corresponding transient signal can be isolated by direct subtraction of experimental data obtained for WT bR and W86F. It shows an instantaneous rise, followed by a decay over approximately 500 fs corresponding to the isomerization time. Interestingly, it does not decay back to zero, thus revealing a change in the local electrostatic environment that remains long after isomerization, in the K intermediate state of the protein cycle. The comparison of WT bR and W86F also leads to a revised interpretation of the overall transient UV absorption of bR."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,An engineered lipocalin specific for CTLA-4 reveals a combining site with structural and conformational features similar to antibodies.,"Biomolecular reagents that enable the specific molecular recognition of proteins play a crucial role in basic research as well as medicine. Up to now, antibodies (immunoglobulins) have been widely used for this purpose. Their predominant feature is the vast repertoire of antigen-binding sites that arise from a set of 6 hypervariable loops. However, antibodies suffer from practical disadvantages because of their complicated architecture, large size, and multiple functions. The lipocalins, on the other hand, have evolved as a protein family that primarily serves for the binding of small molecules. Here, we show that an engineered lipocalin, derived from human Lcn2, can specifically bind the T cell coreceptor CTLA-4 as a prescribed protein target with subnanomolar affinity. Crystallographic analysis reveals that its reshaped cup-like binding site, which is formed by 4 variable loops, provides perfect structural complementarity with this &quot;antigen.&quot; Furthermore, comparison with the crystal structure of the uncomplexed engineered lipocalin indicates a pronounced induced-fit mechanism, a phenomenon so far considered typical for antibodies. By recognizing the same epitope on CTLA-4 that interacts with the counterreceptors B7.1/B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells the engineered Lcn2 exhibits strong, cross-species antagonistic activity, as evidenced by biological effects comparable with a CTLA-4-specific antibody. With its proven stimulatory activity on T cells in vivo, the CTLA-4 blocking lipocalin offers potential for immunotherapy of cancer and infectious disease. Beyond that, lipocalins with engineered antigen-binding sites, so-called Anticalins, provide a class of small ( approximately 180 residues), structurally simple, and robust binding proteins with applications in the life sciences in general."
19489642,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Spatial dynamics of ecological public goods.,"The production, consumption, and exploitation of common resources ranging from extracellular products in microorganisms to global issues of climate change refer to public goods interactions. Individuals can cooperate and sustain common resources at some cost or defect and exploit the resources without contributing. This generates a conflict of interest, which characterizes social dilemmas: Individual selection favors defectors, but for the community, it is best if everybody cooperates. Traditional models of public goods do not take into account that benefits of the common resource enable cooperators to maintain higher population densities. This leads to a natural feedback between population dynamics and interaction group sizes as captured by &quot;ecological public goods.&quot; Here, we show that the spatial evolutionary dynamics of ecological public goods in &quot;selection-diffusion&quot; systems promotes cooperation based on different types of pattern formation processes. In spatial settings, individuals can migrate (diffuse) to populate new territories. Slow diffusion of cooperators fosters aggregation in highly productive patches (activation), whereas fast diffusion enables defectors to readily locate and exploit these patches (inhibition). These antagonistic forces promote coexistence of cooperators and defectors in static or dynamic patterns, including spatial chaos of ever-changing configurations. The local environment of cooperators and defectors is shaped by the production or consumption of common resources. Hence, diffusion-induced self-organization into spatial patterns not only enhances cooperation but also provides simple mechanisms for the spontaneous generation of habitat diversity, which denotes a crucial determinant of the viability of ecological systems."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,Immunization by vaccine-coated microneedle arrays protects against lethal influenza virus challenge.,"Influenza prophylaxis would benefit from a simple method to administer influenza vaccine into skin without the need for hypodermic needles. In this study, solid metal microneedle arrays (MNs) were investigated as a system for cutaneous vaccine delivery using influenza virus antigen. The MNs with 5 monument-shaped microneedles per array were produced and coated with inactivated influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (IIV). As much as 10 microg of viral proteins could be coated onto an array of 5 microneedles, and the coated IIV was delivered into skin at high efficiency within minutes. The coated MNs were used to immunize mice in comparison with conventional intramuscular injection at the same dose. Analysis of immune responses showed that a single immunization with IIV-coated MNs induced strong antibody responses against influenza virus, with significant levels of hemagglutination inhibition activities (&gt;1:40), which were comparable to those induced by conventional intramuscular immunization. Moreover, mice immunized by a single dose of IIV coated on MNs were effectively protected against lethal challenge by a high dose of mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34. These results show that MNs are highly effective as a simple method of vaccine delivery to elicit protective immune responses against virus infection."

U.S.A.,7505876,2009,"Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71, a multimodal inhibitor of malignancy, induces complete responses in triple-negative breast cancer models.","Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are defined by a lack of expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. Because of the absence of identified targets and targeted therapies, and due to a heterogeneous molecular presentation, treatment guidelines for patients with TNBC include only conventional chemotherapy. Such treatment, while effective for some, leaves others with high rates of early relapse and is not curative for any patient with metastatic disease. Here, we demonstrate that these tumors are sensitive to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor PU-H71. Potent and durable anti-tumor effects in TNBC xenografts, including complete response and tumor regression, without toxicity to the host are achieved with this agent. Notably, TNBC tumors respond to retreatment with PU-H71 for several cycles extending for over 5 months without evidence of resistance or toxicity. Through a proteomics approach, we show that multiple oncoproteins involved in tumor proliferation, survival, and invasive potential are in complex with PU-H71-bound Hsp90 in TNBC. PU-H71 induces efficient and sustained downregulation and inactivation, both in vitro and in vivo, of these proteins. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G(2)-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-kappaB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential. The results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC."
19490123,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Theoretical mimicry of biomembranes.,The study of membrane proteins requires a proper consideration of the specific environment provided by the biomembrane. The compositional complexity of this environment poses great challenges to all experimental and theoretical approaches. In this article a rather simple theoretical concept is discussed for its ability to mimic the biomembrane. The biomembrane is approximated by three mimicry solvents forming individual continuum layers of characteristic physical properties. Several specific structural problems are studied with a focus on the biological significance of such an approach. Our results support the general perception that the biomembrane is crucial for correct positioning and embedding of its constituents. The described model provides a semi-quantitative tool of potential interest to many problems in structural membrane biology.
19490124,0,Genome Biol.,100960660,2009,Origin of nascent lineages and the mechanisms used to prime second-strand DNA synthesis in the R1 and R2 retrotransposons of Drosophila.,"BACKGROUND: Most arthropods contain R1 and R2 retrotransposons that specifically insert into the 28S rRNA genes. Here, the sequencing reads from 12 Drosophila genomes have been used to address two questions concerning these elements. First, to what extent is the evolution of these elements subject to the concerted evolution process that is responsible for sequence homogeneity among the different copies of rRNA genes? Second, how precise are the target DNA cleavages and priming of DNA synthesis used by these elements? RESULTS: Most copies of R1 and R2 in each species were found to exhibit less than 0.2% sequence divergence. However, in many species evidence was obtained for the formation of distinct sublineages of elements, particularly in the case of R1. Analysis of the hundreds of R1 and R2 junctions with the 28S gene revealed that cleavage of the first DNA strand was precise both in location and the priming of reverse transcription. Cleavage of the second DNA strand was less precise within a species, differed between species, and gave rise to variable priming mechanisms for second strand synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the high sequence identity amongst R1 and R2 copies is because all copies are relatively new. However, each active element generates its own independent lineage that can eventually populate the locus. Independent lineages occur more often with R1, possibly because these elements contain their own promoter. Finally, both R1 and R2 use imprecise, rapidly evolving mechanisms to cleave the second strand and prime second strand synthesis."
19490362,0,BMC Cancer,100967800,2009,siRNA inhibition of telomerase enhances the anti-cancer effect of doxorubicin in breast cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin is an effective breast cancer drug but is hampered by a severe, dose-dependent toxicity. Concomitant administration of doxorubicin and another cancer drug may be able to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and lowers the therapeutic dosage. In this study, we examined the combined effect of low-dose doxorubicin and siRNA inhibition of telomerase on breast cancer cells. We found that when used individually, both treatments were rapid and potent apoptosis inducers; and when the two treatments were combined, we observed an enhanced and sustained apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells. METHODS: siRNA targeting the mRNA of the protein component of telomerase, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), was transfected into two breast cancer cell lines. The siRNA inhibition was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot on hTERT mRNA and protein levels, respectively, and by measuring the activity level of telomerase using the TRAP assay. The effect of the hTERT siRNA on the tumorigenicity of the breast cancer cells was also studied in vivo by injection of the siRNA-transfected breast cancer cells into nude mice. The effects on cell viability, apoptosis and senescence of cells treated with hTERT siRNA, doxorubicin, and the combined treatment of doxorubicin and hTERT siRNA, were examined in vitro by MTT assay, FACS and SA-beta-galactosidase staining. RESULTS: The hTERT siRNA effectively knocked down the mRNA and protein levels of hTERT, and reduced the telomerase activity to 30% of the untreated control. In vivo, the tumors induced by the hTERT siRNA-transfected cells were of reduced sizes, indicating that the hTERT siRNA also reduced the tumorigenic potential of the breast cancer cells. The siRNA treatment reduced cell viability by 50% in breast cancer cells within two days after transfection, while 0.5 microM doxorubicin treatment had a comparable effect but with a slower kinetics. The combination of hTERT siRNA and 0.5 microM doxorubicin killed twice as many cancer cells, showing a cumulative effect of the two treatments. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the potential of telomerase inhibition as an effective treatment for breast cancer. When used in conjunction to doxorubicin, it could potentiate the cytotoxic effect of the drug to breast cancer cells."

However, little is known about the role of CD36 in cerebral ischemia. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that CD36, whose functions have been implicated in other pathological events, is a prototypic inflammatory receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The importance of CD36 as a treatment target is indicated by the fact that many treatment strategies that are effective in experimental models of stroke exhibit little or no efficacy in clinical trials. The failure of clinical trials may be due to the use of animal models of stroke that do not reflect traditional risk factors for stroke in humans. The discussion will be focused on two risk factors, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, that modulate CD36 responses. Blocking the expression and function of CD36 by pharmacological or genetic means will provide insight not only toward identifying CD36 as a novel molecular target but also for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat stroke victims. More importantly, coupling clinically relevant conditions with CD36-mediated ischemic injury may provide an appropriate animal model paradigm and develop a scientific understanding that could lead to clinical translational studies involving human subjects."

It allows spatial localization of multiple different compounds that are recorded in parallel without the need of a label. It is currently one of the rapidly developing techniques in the proteomics toolbox. Different complementary imaging MS methods, i.e. MALDI and secondary ion MS imaging for direct tissue analysis, can be applied on exactly the same tissue sample. This allows the identification of small molecules, peptides and proteins present on the same sample surface. Sample preparation is crucial to obtain high quality, reliable and reproducible complementary molecular images. It is essential to optimize the conditions for each step in the sample preparation protocol, ranging from sample collection and storage to surface modification. In this article, we review and discuss the importance of correct sample treatment in case of MALDI and secondary ion MS imaging experiments and describe the experimental requirements for optimal sample preparation."
19491254,0,Proteomics,101092707,2009,Phosphoproteomic analysis of distinct tumor cell lines in response to nocodazole treatment.,"Here, we report for the first time a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of distinct tumor cell lines in the presence or absence of the microtubule-interfering agent nocodazole. In total, 1525 phosphorylation sites assigned to 726 phosphoproteins were identified using LC-MS-based technology following phosphopeptide enrichment. Analysis of the amino acid composition surrounding the identified in vivo phosphorylation sites revealed that they could be classified into two motif groups: pSer-Pro and pSer-Asp/Glu. Phosphoproteomic change resulting from nocodazole treatment varied among cell lines in terms of the numbers of total phosphopeptides identified, motif groups, and functional annotation groups; however, the cell lines were equally sensitive to nocodazole. The identified phosphoproteome subset contained major signaling proteins and proteins known to be involved in mitosis, but did not always exhibit the same changes in the tumor cells from nocodazole treatment. In spite of the complex changes observed in the phosphorylation of many of the proteins, possible common features induced by nocodazole were found, including phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM) S254 and coatomer protein complex, subunit alpha (COPA) S173, suggesting that the events are not cell-type specific but events generally occurring in mitosis or induced by a microtubule-interfering agent. Further, temporal analysis of phosphoproteome change revealed that phosphorylation of NPM S254 and COPA S173 was observed from the early (6 h) and late (24 h) time point after nocodazole treatment, respectively, suggesting that NPM S254 may be involved in the induction of M-phase arrest by nocodazole, whereas COPA S173 may be caused as a result of M-phase arrest."

Here, we assessed whether alpha-GalCer could act as a mucosal adjuvant for induction of protective immunity against genital herpes. We found that intranasal immunization with HSV-2 glycoprotein D (gD) in combination with alpha-GalCer elicits strong systemic gD-specific IgG Ab response as well as lymphoproliferative response with a mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine profile in the spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and genital lymph nodes. Importantly, such an immunization scheme conferred complete protection against an otherwise lethal vaginal HSV-2 challenge. We could also show that intravaginal immunization with gD plus alpha-GalCer generates potent gD-specific lymphoproliferative and IFN-gamma responses in the genital lymph nodes and spleen. Furthermore, the vaginally immunized mice developed a strong systemic and mucosal IgG Ab response and protection against vaginal HSV-2 challenge. The mucosal adjuvant effect of alpha-GalCer was found to be mediated via CD1d molecule and appeared to be independent of the usage of the adaptor molecule MyD88. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the mucosal adjuvant effect of alpha-GalCer for induction of protective immunity against a sexually transmitted pathogen."

It is well established that professional APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages efficiently process viral particles for both MHC class I- and MHC class II-associated presentation, which is essential for induction of CTL and Th cell responses, respectively. Less is known, however, about the ability of B cells to present epitopes derived from viral particles to T cells. Using two different VLPs, in this study we show in vitro as well as in vivo that DCs present VLP-derived peptides in association with MHC class I as well as class II. In contrast, although B cells were able to capture VLPs similarly as DCs and although they efficiently processed VLPs for presentation in association with MHC class II, they failed to process exogenous VLPs for presentation in association with MHC class I. Thus, in contrast to DCs, B cells are not involved in the process of cross-priming. This finding is of physiological importance because B cells with the ability to cross-present Ag to specific CD8(+) T cells may be killed by these cells, preventing the generation of neutralizing Ab responses."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Differentiation of central memory CD8 T cells is independent of CD62L-mediated trafficking to lymph nodes.,"CD62L (L-selectin) is a key regulator of T cell trafficking, and its surface expression on activated T cells is modulated to control T cell access to lymph nodes after acute infections. In memory T cells, CD62L is the most frequently used marker to define central memory T cells, a population that provides enhanced protection against most, but not all, pathogens. Early access of CD62L(pos) effector T cells to lymph nodes has been proposed to result in preferential central memory T cell differentiation, but direct proof for the involvement of lymph node homing in memory T cell differentiation is lacking. In this study, we show that central memory lineage commitment in CD8 T cells is unaltered by enhanced entry into lymph nodes as a result of constitutive CD62L expression, and that equal numbers of effector and central memory CD8 T cells develop in the absence of CD62L-mediated lymph node trafficking. Our results suggest that CD62L is not a deterministic marker of central memory T cell differentiation, thus providing new insight into the process of memory CD8 T cell generation."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Notch activation induces the generation of functional NK cells from human cord blood CD34-positive cells devoid of IL-15.,"The development of NK cells from hematopoietic stem cells is thought to be dependent on IL-15. In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of human cord blood CD34(+) cells by a Notch ligand, Delta4, along with IL-7, stem cell factor, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, but no IL-15, in a stroma-free culture induced the generation of cells with characteristics of functional NK cells, including CD56 and CD161 Ag expression, IFN-gamma secretion, and cytotoxic activity against K562 and Jurkat cells. Addition of gamma-secretase inhibitor and anti-human Notch1 Ab to the culture medium almost completely blocked NK cell emergence. Addition of anti-human IL-15-neutralizing Ab did not affect NK cell development in these culture conditions. The presence of IL-15, however, augmented cytotoxicity and was required for a more mature NK cell phenotype. CD56(+) cells generated by culture with IL-15, but without Notch stimulation, were negative for CD7 and cytoplasmic CD3, whereas CD56(+) cells generated by culture with both Delta4 and IL-15 were CD7(+) and cytoplasmic CD3(+) from the beginning and therefore more similar to in vivo human NK cell progenitors. Together, these results suggest that Notch signaling is important for the physiologic development of NK cells at differentiation stages beyond those previously postulated."
19492063,1,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Activation of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 causes rapid involution of the thymus.,"In the course of infection, the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by specialized pattern recognition receptors in the host leads to activation of the innate immune system. Whereas the subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs is well described, little is known about the effects of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced activation on primary lymphoid organs. Here we show that activation of innate immunity through the virus-sensing melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) receptor causes a rapid involution of the thymus. We observed a strong decrease in thymic cellularity associated with characteristic alterations in thymic subpopulations and microanatomy. In contrast, immune stimulation with potent TLR agonists did not lead to thymic involution or induce changes in thymic subpopulations, demonstrating that thymic pathology is not a general consequence of innate immune activation. We determined that suppression of thymocyte proliferation and enhanced apoptosis are the essential cellular mechanisms involved in the decrease in thymic size upon MDA-5 activation. Further, thymic involution critically depended on type I IFN. Strikingly however, no direct action of type I IFN on thymocytes was required, given that the decrease in thymic size was still observed in mice with a selective deletion of the type I IFN receptor on T cells. All changes observed were self-limiting, given that cessation of MDA-5 activation led to a rapid recovery of thymic size. We show for the first time that the in vivo activation of the virus-sensing MDA-5 receptor leads to a rapid and reversible involution of the thymus."

Immunol.,2985117R,2009,CD8 T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-gamma initiate the innate immune response required for responses to antigen skin challenge.,"Effector CD8 T cell recruitment into the skin in response to Ag challenge requires prior CXCL1/KC-directed neutrophil infiltration. Mechanisms inducing CXCL1 production and the dynamics of neutrophil-CD8 T cell interactions during elicitation of Ag-specific responses in the skin were investigated. CXCL1 and CXCL2/MIP-2 were produced within 3-6 h of Ag challenge at 10-fold higher levels in skin challenge sites of Ag-sensitized vs nonsensitized mice. In the challenge sites of sensitized mice this production decreased at 6-9 h postchallenge to near the levels observed in skin challenge sites of nonsensitized mice but rose to a second peak 12 h after challenge. The elevated early neutrophil chemoattractant production at 3-6 h after skin challenge of sensitized animals required both IFN-gamma and IL-17, produced by distinct populations of Ag-primed CD8 T cells in response to Ag challenge. Although induced by the Ag-primed CD8 T cells, the early CXCL1 and CXCL2 production was accompanied by neutrophil but not CD8 T cell infiltration into the skin Ag challenge site. Infiltration of the CD8 T cells into the challenge site was not observed until 18-24 h after challenge. These results demonstrate an intricate series of early interactions between Ag-specific and innate immune components that regulate the sequential infiltration of neutrophils and then effector T cells into the skin to mediate an immune response."
19492078,0,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2009,Central memory CD8+ T cells induce graft-versus-host disease and mediate graft-versus-leukemia.,"In allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, mature donor alphabeta T cells in the allograft promote T cell reconstitution in the recipient and mediate the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect. Unfortunately, donor T cells can attack nonmalignant host tissues and cause graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). It has previously been shown that effector memory T cells not primed to alloantigen do not cause GVHD yet transfer functional T cell memory and mediate GVL. Recently, central memory T cells (T(CM)) have also been reported to not cause GVHD. In contrast, in this study, we demonstrate that purified CD8(+) T(CM) not specifically primed to alloantigens mediate GVHD in the MHC-mismatched C57BL/6 (B6)--&gt;BALB/c and the MHC-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched C3H.SW--&gt;B6 strain pairings. CD8(+) T(CM) and naive T cells (T(N)) caused similar histological disease in liver, skin, and bowel. B6 CD8(+) T(CM) and T(N) similarly expanded in BALB/c recipients, and the majority of their progeny produced IFN-gamma upon restimulation. However, in both models, CD8(+) T(CM) induced milder clinical GVHD than did CD8(+) T(N). Nonetheless, CD8(+) T(CM) and T(N) were similarly potent mediators of GVL against a mouse model of chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thus, in contrast to what was previously thought, CD8(+) T(CM) are capable of inducing GVHD and are substantially different from T(EM) but only subtly so from T(N)."
19492080,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,Roles of CLOCK phosphorylation in suppression of E-box-dependent transcription.,"In mammalian circadian clockwork, the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer activates E-box-dependent transcription, while its activity is suppressed by circadian binding with negative regulators, such as CRYs. Here, we found that the CLOCK protein is kept mostly in the phosphorylated form throughout the day and is partly hyperphosphorylated in the suppression phase of E-box-dependent transcription in the mouse liver and NIH 3T3 cells. Coexpression of CRY2 in NIH 3T3 cells inhibited the phosphorylation of CLOCK, whereas CIPC coexpression markedly stimulated phosphorylation, indicating that CLOCK phosphorylation is regulated by a combination of the negative regulators in the suppression phase. CLOCK-BMAL1 purified from the mouse liver was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which identified Ser38, Ser42, and Ser427 as in vivo phosphorylation sites of CLOCK. Ser38Asp and Ser42Asp mutations of CLOCK additively and markedly weakened the transactivation activity of CLOCK-BMAL1, with downregulation of the nuclear amount of CLOCK and the DNA-binding activity. On the other hand, CLOCK Delta 19, lacking the CIPC-binding domain, was far less phosphorylated and much more stabilized than wild-type CLOCK in vivo. Calyculin A treatment of cultured NIH 3T3 cells promoted CLOCK phosphorylation and facilitated its proteasomal degradation. Together, these results show that CLOCK phosphorylation contributes to the suppression of CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transactivation through dual regulation: inhibition of CLOCK activity and promotion of its degradation."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,The antifungal agent itraconazole induces the accumulation of high mannose glycoproteins in macrophages.,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key mediator in the development of Gram-negative septic shock, which is a major health problem. The effect of LPS on myeloid cells is mediated by a multicomplex receptor system in which CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, and Toll-like receptor 4 are the major players. We have found that incubation of macrophages with itraconazole (ICZ), an azole antifungal commonly used in humans, altered both the expression and glycosylation of CD14. This glycoprotein, which is endo H-resistant in untreated cells, becomes endo H-sensitive following ICZ treatment. The effect of ICZ on glycan processing was observed in all newly synthesized glycoproteins as indicated by incorporation of [2-(3)H]mannose. In addition, cells treated with ICZ increased surface concanavalin A (ConA) binding, corroborating an increase in high mannose surface glycoproteins. Although the glycosylation pattern of CD14 was altered, this glycoprotein was delivered to the cell surface or was secreted. Moreover, it appeared functional as demonstrated by the release of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha under conditions specific for a CD14-mediated activation process. The effect of ICZ on glycosylation was not dependent on inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and was specific for this drug because other azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole and econazole, did not alter glycan processing. These results suggest a possible secondary effect of ICZ that impacts the processing of glyconjugates and may alter cellular function and homeostasis."

Chem.,2985121R,2009,Inhibiting JNK dephosphorylation and induction of apoptosis by novel anticancer agent NSC-741909 in cancer cells.,"NSC-741909 is a recently identified novel anticancer agent that suppresses the growth of several NCI-60 cancer cell lines with a unique anticancer spectrum. However, its molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To determine the molecular mechanisms of NSC-741909-induced antitumor activity, we analyzed the changes of 77 protein biomarkers in a sensitive lung cancer cell line after treatment with this compound by using reverse-phase protein microarray. The results showed that phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (P38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK) were persistently elevated by the treatment with NSC-741909. However, only the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 effectively blocked the apoptosis induced by NSC-741909. Moreover, NSC-741909-mediated apoptosis was also blocked by a dominant-negative JNK construct, suggesting that sustained activation of JNK is critical for the apoptosis induction. Further studies revealed that treatment with NSC-741909 suppressed dephosphorylation of JNK and the expression of MAPK phosphatase-1. Thus, NSC-741909-mediated inhibition of JNK dephosphorylation results in sustained JNK activation, which leads to apoptosis in cancer cells."
19492091,0,Genetics,374636,2009,Nonmetric multidimensional scaling corrects for population structure in association mapping with different sample types.,"Recent research has developed various promising methods to control for population structure in genomewide association mapping of complex traits, but systematic examination of how well these methods perform under different genetic scenarios is still lacking. Appropriate methods for controlling genetic relationships among individuals need to balance the concern of false positives and statistical power, which can vary for different association sample types. We used a series of simulated samples and empirical data sets from cross- and self-pollinated species to demonstrate the performance of several contemporary methods in correcting for different types of genetic relationships encountered in association analysis. We proposed a two-stage dimension determination approach for both principal component analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) to capture the major structure pattern in association mapping samples. Our results showed that by exploiting both genotypic and phenotypic information, this two-stage dimension determination approach balances the trade-off between data fit and model complexity, resulting in an effective reduction in false positive rate with minimum loss in statistical power. Further, the nMDS technique of correcting for genetic relationship proved to be a powerful complement to other existing methods. Our findings highlight the significance of appropriate application of different statistical methods for dealing with complex genetic relationships in various genomewide association studies."
19492796,0,Genetics,374636,2009,Quantitative trait loci for aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Aggressive behavior is observed across animal taxa and is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. Although potentially advantageous, aggression can have social and health consequences in humans, and is a component of a number of psychiatric disorders. As a complex genetic trait, it is modulated by numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) with allelic effects that can vary in direction and magnitude and that are sensitive to environmental perturbations. Assays to quantify aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been developed, making this an ideal model system in which to dissect the genomic architecture underlying manifestation of and variation in aggressive behavior. Here, we map QTL affecting variation in aggression between two wild-type Drosophila strains. We identified a minimum of five QTL in a genomewide scan: two on chromosome 2 and three on chromosome 3. At least three and possibly all five of these QTL interact epistatically. We used deficiency complementation mapping to subdivide two linked, epistatically interacting QTL of large effect on chromosome 3 into at least six QTL, and complementation tests to mutations identified four candidate quantitative trait genes. Extensive epistasis poses a serious challenge for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits."

Biol.,2985088R,2009,Structural and functional analysis of the globular head domain of p115 provides insight into membrane tethering.,"Molecular tethers have a central role in the organization of the complex membrane architecture of eukaryotic cells. p115 is a ubiquitous, essential tether involved in vesicle transport and the structural organization of the exocytic pathway. We describe two crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of p115 at 2.0 A resolution. The p115 structures show a novel alpha-solenoid architecture constructed of 12 armadillo-like, tether-repeat, alpha-helical tripod motifs. We find that the H1 TR binds the Rab1 GTPase involved in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport. Mutation of the H1 motif results in the dominant negative inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking. We propose that the H1 helical tripod contributes to the assembly of Rab-dependent complexes responsible for the tether and SNARE-dependent fusion of membranes."

J.,370626,2009,Mechanical characterization of protein L in the low-force regime by electromagnetic tweezers/evanescent nanometry.,"Mechanical manipulation at the single molecule level of proteins exhibiting mechanical stability poses a technical challenge that has been almost exclusively approached by atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. However, due to mechanical drift limitations, AFM techniques are restricted to experimental recordings that last less than a minute in the high-force regime. Here we demonstrate a novel combination of electromagnetic tweezers and evanescent nanometry that readily captures the forced unfolding trajectories of protein L at pulling forces as low as 10-15 pN. Using this approach, we monitor unfolding and refolding cycles of the same polyprotein for a period of time longer than 30 min. From such long-lasting recordings, we obtain ensemble averages of unfolding step sizes and rates that are consistent with single-molecule AFM data obtained at higher stretching forces. The unfolding kinetics of protein L at low stretching forces confirms and extends the observations that the mechanical unfolding rate is exponentially dependent on the pulling force within a wide range of stretching forces spanning from 13 pN up to 120 pN. Our experiments demonstrate a novel approach for the mechanical manipulation of single proteins for extended periods of time in the low-force regime."
19492834,0,Biophys. J.,370626,2009,Urea impedes the hydrophobic collapse of partially unfolded proteins.,"Proteins are denatured in aqueous urea solution. The nature of the molecular driving forces has received substantial attention in the past, whereas the question how urea acts at different phases of unfolding is not yet well understood at the atomic level. In particular, it is unclear whether urea actively attacks folded proteins or instead stabilizes unfolded conformations. Here we investigated the effect of urea at different phases of unfolding by molecular dynamics simulations, and the behavior of partially unfolded states in both aqueous urea solution and in pure water was compared. Whereas the partially unfolded protein in water exhibited hydrophobic collapses as primary refolding events, it remained stable or even underwent further unfolding steps in aqueous urea solution. Further, initial unfolding steps of the folded protein were found not to be triggered by urea, but instead, stabilized. The underlying mechanism of this stabilization is a favorable interaction of urea with transiently exposed, less-polar residues and the protein backbone, thereby impeding back-reactions. Taken together, these results suggest that, quite generally, urea-induced protein unfolding proceeds primarily not by active attack. Rather, thermal fluctuations toward the unfolded state are stabilized and the hydrophobic collapse of partially unfolded proteins toward the native state is impeded. As a result, the equilibrium is shifted toward the unfolded state."

J.,370626,2009,Hidden Markov analysis of nucleosome unwrapping under force.,"Transient conformational changes of DNA-protein complexes play an important role in the DNA metabolism but are generally difficult to resolve. Single molecule force spectroscopy has the unique capability to follow such reactions but Brownian fluctuations in the end-to-end distance of a DNA tether can obscure these events. Here we measured the force-induced unwrapping of DNA from a single nucleosome and show that hidden Markov analysis, adopted for the nonlinear force-extension of DNA, can readily resolve unwrapping events that are significantly smaller than the Brownian fluctuations. The resulting probability distributions of the tether length are used to accurately resolve small changes in contour length and persistence length. The latter is shown to be directly related to the DNA bending angle of the complex. The wormlike chain-adapted hidden Markov analysis can be used for any transient DNA-protein complex and provides a robust method for the investigation of these transient events."

J.,370626,2009,Peptide nanopores and lipid bilayers: interactions by coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations.,"A set of 49 protein nanopore-lipid bilayer systems was explored by means of coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations to study the interactions between nanopores and the lipid bilayers in which they are embedded. The seven nanopore species investigated represent the two main structural classes of membrane proteins (alpha-helical and beta-barrel), and the seven different bilayer systems range in thickness from approximately 28 to approximately 43 A. The study focuses on the local effects of hydrophobic mismatch between the nanopore and the lipid bilayer. The effects of nanopore insertion on lipid bilayer thickness, the dependence between hydrophobic thickness and the observed nanopore tilt angle, and the local distribution of lipid types around a nanopore in mixed-lipid bilayers are all analyzed. Different behavior for nanopores of similar hydrophobic length but different geometry is observed. The local lipid bilayer perturbation caused by the inserted nanopores suggests possible mechanisms for both lipid bilayer-induced protein sorting and protein-induced lipid sorting. A correlation between smaller lipid bilayer thickness (larger hydrophobic mismatch) and larger nanopore tilt angle is observed and, in the case of larger hydrophobic mismatches, the simulated tilt angle distribution seems to broaden. Furthermore, both nanopore size and key residue types (e.g., tryptophan) seem to influence the level of protein tilt, emphasizing the reciprocal nature of nanopore-lipid bilayer interactions."
19493159,1,Cell,413066,2009,SIRT5 Deacetylates carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 and regulates the urea cycle.,"Sirtuins are NAD-dependent protein deacetylases that connect metabolism and aging. In mammals, there are seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7), three of which are associated with mitochondria. Here, we show that SIRT5 localizes in the mitochondrial matrix and interacts with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), an enzyme, catalyzing the initial step of the urea cycle for ammonia detoxification and disposal. SIRT5 deacetylates CPS1 and upregulates its activity. During fasting, NAD in liver mitochondria increases, thereby triggering SIRT5 deacetylation of CPS1 and adaptation to the increase in amino acid catabolism. Indeed, SIRT5 KO mice fail to upregulate CPS1 activity and show elevated blood ammonia during fasting. Similar effects occur during long-term calorie restriction or a high protein diet. These findings demonstrate SIRT5 plays a pivotal role in ammonia detoxification and disposal by activating CPS1."
19493165,0,Cell,413066,2009,An effector of RNA-directed DNA methylation in arabidopsis is an ARGONAUTE 4- and RNA-binding protein.,"DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic mark in plants and mammals. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be triggered by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Here, we report the identification of an RdDM effector, KTF1. Loss-of-function mutations in KTF1 reduce DNA methylation and release the silencing of RdDM target loci without abolishing the siRNA triggers. KTF1 has similarity to the transcription elongation factor SPT5 and contains a C-terminal extension rich in GW/WG repeats. KTF1 colocalizes with ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) in punctate nuclear foci and binds AGO4 and RNA transcripts. Our results suggest KTF1 as an adaptor protein that binds scaffold transcripts generated by Pol V and recruits AGO4 and AGO4-bound siRNAs to form an RdDM effector complex. The dual interaction of an effector protein with AGO and small RNA target transcripts may be a general feature of RNA-silencing effector complexes."
19493169,0,Cell,413066,2009,Centromere-specific assembly of CENP-a nucleosomes is mediated by HJURP.,"The centromere is responsible for accurate chromosome segregation. Mammalian centromeres are specified epigenetically, with all active centromeres containing centromere-specific chromatin in which CENP-A replaces histone H3 within the nucleosome. The proteins responsible for assembly of human CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle are shown here to be distinct from the chromatin assembly factors previously shown to load other histone H3 variants. Here we demonstrate that prenucleosomal CENP-A is complexed with histone H4, nucleophosmin 1, and HJURP. Recruitment of new CENP-A into nucleosomes at replicated centromeres is dependent on HJURP. Recognition by HJURP is mediated through the centromere targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A, a region that we demonstrated previously to induce a unique conformational rigidity to both the subnucleosomal CENP-A heterotetramer and the corresponding assembled nucleosome. We propose HJURP to be a cell-cycle-regulated CENP-A-specific histone chaperone required for centromeric chromatin assembly."
19493341,0,Cell,413066,2009,RAD6-Mediated transcription-coupled H2B ubiquitylation directly stimulates H3K4 methylation in human cells.,"H2B ubiquitylation has been implicated in active transcription but is not well understood in mammalian cells. Beyond earlier identification of hBRE1 as the E3 ligase for H2B ubiquitylation in human cells, we now show (1) that hRAD6 serves as the cognate E2-conjugating enzyme; (2) that hRAD6, through direct interaction with hPAF-bound hBRE1, is recruited to transcribed genes and ubiquitylates chromatinized H2B at lysine 120; (3) that hPAF-mediated transcription is required for efficient H2B ubiquitylation as a result of hPAF-dependent recruitment of hBRE1-hRAD6 to the Pol II transcription machinery; (4) that H2B ubiquitylation per se does not affect the level of hPAF-, SII-, and p300-dependent transcription and likely functions downstream; and (5) that H2B ubiquitylation directly stimulates hSET1-dependent H3K4 di- and trimethylation. These studies establish the natural H2B ubiquitylation factors in human cells and also detail the mechanistic basis for H2B ubiquitylation and function during transcription."
19493963,0,Science,404511,2009,Regulators of PP2C phosphatase activity function as abscisic acid sensors.,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a developmental signal and as an integrator of environmental cues such as drought and cold. Key players in ABA signal transduction include the type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) ABI1 and ABI2, which act by negatively regulating ABA responses. In this study, we identify interactors of ABI1 and ABI2 which we have named regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCARs). In Arabidopsis, RCARs belong to a family with 14 members that share structural similarity with class 10 pathogen-related proteins. RCAR1 was shown to bind ABA, to mediate ABA-dependent inactivation of ABI1 or ABI2 in vitro, and to antagonize PP2C action in planta. Other RCARs also mediated ABA-dependent regulation of ABI1 and ABI2, consistent with a combinatorial assembly of receptor complexes."
19493964,0,Cell,413066,2009,Dimethylation of H3K4 by Set1 recruits the Set3 histone deacetylase complex to 5' transcribed regions.,"Cotranscriptional histone methylations by Set1 and Set2 have been shown to affect histone acetylation at promoters and 3' regions of genes, respectively. While histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is thought to promote nucleosome acetylation and remodeling near promoters, we show here that H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) by Set1 leads to reduced histone acetylation levels near 5' ends of genes. H3K4me2 recruits the Set3 complex via the Set3 PHD finger, localizing the Hos2 and Hst1 subunits to deacetylate histones in 5' transcribed regions. Cells lacking the Set1-Set3 complex pathway are sensitive to mycophenolic acid and have reduced polymerase levels at a Set3 target gene, suggesting a positive role in transcription. We propose that Set1 establishes two distinct chromatin zones on genes: H3K4me3 leads to high levels of acetylation and low nucleosome density at promoters, while H3K4me2 just downstream recruits the Set3 complex to suppress nucleosome acetylation and remodeling."
19493993,0,Cell,413066,2009,The postsynaptic density proteins Homer and Shank form a polymeric network structure.,"The postsynaptic density (PSD) is crucial for synaptic functions, but the molecular architecture retaining its structure and components remains elusive. Homer and Shank are among the most abundant scaffolding proteins in the PSD, working synergistically for maturation of dendritic spines. Here, we demonstrate that Homer and Shank, together, form a mesh-like matrix structure. Crystallographic analysis of this region revealed a pair of parallel dimeric coiled coils intercalated in a tail-to-tail fashion to form a tetramer, giving rise to the unique configuration of a pair of N-terminal EVH1 domains at each end of the coiled coil. In neurons, the tetramerization is required for structural integrity of the dendritic spines and recruitment of proteins to synapses. We propose that the Homer-Shank complex serves as a structural framework and as an assembly platform for other PSD proteins."
19493994,0,Cell,413066,2009,RAP1 is essential for silencing telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes in Trypanosoma brucei.,"Trypanosoma brucei expresses variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes in a strictly monoallelic fashion in its mammalian hosts, but it is unclear how this important virulence mechanism is enforced. Telomere position effect, an epigenetic phenomenon, has been proposed to play a critical role in VSG regulation, yet no telomeric protein has been identified whose disruption led to VSG derepression. We now identify tbRAP1 as an intrinsic component of the T. brucei telomere complex and a major regulator for silencing VSG expression sites (ESs). Knockdown of tbRAP1 led to derepression of all VSGs in silent ESs, but not VSGs located elsewhere, and resulted in stronger derepression of genes located within 10 kb from telomeres than genes located further upstream. This graduated silencing pattern suggests that telomere integrity plays a key role in tbRAP1-dependent silencing and VSG regulation."
19494007,0,Cell,413066,2009,A Nurr1/CoREST pathway in microglia and astrocytes protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammation-induced death.,"Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor, plays an essential role in the generation and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Rare mutations in Nurr1 are associated with familial Parkinson's disease, but the underlying basis for this relationship has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that Nurr1 unexpectedly functions to inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic mediators in both microglia and astrocytes. Reduced Nurr1 expression results in exaggerated inflammatory responses in microglia that are further amplified by astrocytes, leading to the production of factors that cause death of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by docking to NF-kappaB-p65 on target inflammatory gene promoters in a signal-dependent manner. Subsequently, Nurr1 recruits the CoREST corepressor complex, resulting in clearance of NF-kappaB-p65 and transcriptional repression. These studies suggest that Nurr1 protects against loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease in part by limiting the production of neurotoxic mediators by microglia and astrocytes."
19494018,1,Cell,413066,2009,The Ste5 scaffold directs mating signaling by catalytically unlocking the Fus3 MAP kinase for activation.,"The scaffold protein Ste5 is required to properly direct signaling through the yeast mating pathway to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Fus3. Scaffolds are thought to function by tethering kinase and substrate in proximity. We find, however, that the previously identified Fus3-binding site on Ste5 is not required for signaling, suggesting an alternative mechanism controls Fus3's activation by the MAPKK Ste7. Reconstituting MAPK signaling in vitro, we find that Fus3 is an intrinsically poor substrate for Ste7, although the related filamentation MAPK, Kss1, is an excellent substrate. We identify and structurally characterize a domain in Ste5 that catalytically unlocks Fus3 for phosphorylation by Ste7. This domain selectively increases the k(cat) of Ste7--&gt;Fus3 phosphorylation but has no effect on Ste7--&gt;Kss1 phosphorylation. The dual requirement for both Ste7 and this Ste5 domain in Fus3 activation explains why Fus3 is selectively activated by the mating pathway and not by other pathways that also utilize Ste7."
19494040,0,Cell,413066,2009,The BRC repeats of BRCA2 modulate the DNA-binding selectivity of RAD51.,"The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, is essential for recombinational DNA repair. BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks through interaction with eight conserved, approximately 35 amino acid motifs, the BRC repeats. Here we show that the solitary BRC4 promotes assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not dsDNA, to stimulate DNA strand exchange. BRC4 acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis and thereby maintaining the active ATP-bound form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Single-molecule visualization shows that BRC4 does not disassemble RAD51-dsDNA filaments but rather blocks nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA. Furthermore, this behavior is manifested by a domain of BRCA2 comprising all eight BRC repeats. These results establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and prohibiting RAD51 nucleation onto dsDNA. Thus, BRCA2 recruits RAD51 to DNA breaks and, we propose, the BRC repeats regulate DNA-binding selectivity."
19494041,0,Cell,413066,2009,Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 regulates neuronal progenitor proliferation via modulation of GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling.,"The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene is disrupted by a balanced chromosomal translocation (1; 11) (q42; q14.3) in a Scottish family with a high incidence of major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Subsequent studies provided indications that DISC1 plays a role in brain development. Here, we demonstrate that suppression of DISC1 expression reduces neural progenitor proliferation, leading to premature cell cycle exit and differentiation. Several lines of evidence suggest that DISC1 mediates this function by regulating GSK3beta. First, DISC1 inhibits GSK3beta activity through direct physical interaction, which reduces beta-catenin phosphorylation and stabilizes beta-catenin. Importantly, expression of stabilized beta-catenin overrides the impairment of progenitor proliferation caused by DISC1 loss of function. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibitors normalize progenitor proliferation and behavioral defects caused by DISC1 loss of function. Together, these results implicate DISC1 in GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathways and provide a framework for understanding how alterations in this pathway may contribute to the etiology of psychiatric disorders."
19494110,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2009,PME-1 protects extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activity from protein phosphatase 2A-mediated inactivation in human malignant glioma.,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity is regulated by the antagonist function of activating kinases and inactivating protein phosphatases. Sustained ERK pathway activity is commonly observed in human malignancies; however, the mechanisms by which the pathway is protected from phosphatase-mediated inactivation in the tumor tissue remain obscure. Here, we show that methylesterase PME-1-mediated inhibition of the protein phosphatase 2A promotes basal ERK pathway activity and is required for efficient growth factor response. Mechanistically, PME-1 is shown to support ERK pathway signaling upstream of Raf, but downstream of growth factor receptors and protein kinase C. In malignant gliomas, PME-1 expression levels correlate with both ERK activity and cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, PME-1 expression significantly correlates with disease progression in human astrocytic gliomas (n=222). Together, these observations identify PME-1 expression as one mechanism by which ERK pathway activity is maintained in cancer cells and suggest an important functional role for PME-1 in the disease progression of human astrocytic gliomas."

All mendelian patterns of inheritance have been described. We identified a homozygous p.A335V mutation in the MED25 gene in an extended Costa Rican family with autosomal recessively inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy linked to the CMT2B2 locus in chromosome 19q13.3. MED25, also known as ARC92 and ACID1, is a subunit of the human activator-recruited cofactor (ARC), a family of large transcriptional coactivator complexes related to the yeast Mediator. MED25 was identified by virtue of functional association with the activator domains of multiple cellular and viral transcriptional activators. Its exact physiological function in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. The CMT2B2-associated missense amino acid substitution p.A335V is located in a proline-rich region with high affinity for SH3 domains of the Abelson type. The mutation causes a decrease in binding specificity leading to the recognition of a broader range of SH3 domain proteins. Furthermore, Med25 is coordinately expressed with Pmp22 gene dosage and expression in transgenic mice and rats. These results suggest a potential role of this protein in the molecular etiology of CMT2B2 and suggest a potential, more general role of MED25 in gene dosage sensitive peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis."

Here we report that FBL17, an Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein, is involved in cell cycle regulation during male gametogenesis. FBL17 expression is strongly enhanced in plants co-expressing E2Fa and DPa, transcription factors that promote S-phase entry. FBL17 loss-of-function mutants fail to undergo pollen mitosis II, which generates the two sperm cells in mature A. thaliana pollen. Nonetheless, the single sperm cell-like cell in fbl17 mutants is functional but will exclusively fertilize the egg cell of the female gametophyte, giving rise to an embryo that will later abort, most likely due to the lack of functional endosperm. Seed abortion can, however, be overcome by mutations in FIE, a component of the Polycomb group complex, overall resembling loss-of-function mutations in the A. thaliana cyclin-dependent kinase CDKA;1. Finally we identified ASK11, as an SKP1-like partner protein of FBL17 and discuss a possible mechanism how SCF(FBL17) may regulate cell division during male gametogenesis."
19494125,0,Cell,413066,2009,nhl-2 Modulates microRNA activity in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"TRIM-NHL proteins represent a large class of metazoan proteins implicated in development and disease. We demonstrate that a C. elegans TRIM-NHL protein, NHL-2, functions as a cofactor for the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and thereby enhances the posttranscriptional repression of several genetically verified microRNA targets, including hbl-1 and let-60/Ras (by the let-7 family of microRNAs) and cog-1 (by the lsy-6 microRNA). NHL-2 is localized to cytoplasmic P-bodies and physically associates with the P-body protein CGH-1 and the core miRISC components ALG-1/2 and AIN-1. nhl-2 and cgh-1 mutations compromise the repression of microRNA targets in vivo but do not affect microRNA biogenesis, indicating a role for an NHL-2:CGH-1 complex in the effector phase of miRISC activity. We propose that the NHL-2:CGH-1 complex functions in association with mature miRISC to modulate the efficacy of microRNA:target interactions in response to physiological and developmental signals, thereby ensuring the robustness of genetic regulatory pathways regulated by microRNAs."
19494136,0,Cell,413066,2009,A PP2A regulatory subunit regulates C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 signaling by modulating AKT-1 phosphorylation.,"The C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) cascade plays a central role in regulating life span, dauer, metabolism, and stress. The major regulatory control of IIS is through phosphorylation of its components by serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. An RNAi screen for serine/threonine protein phosphatases that counterbalance the effect of the kinases in the IIS pathway identified pptr-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Modulation of pptr-1 affects IIS pathway-associated phenotypes including life span, dauer, stress resistance, and fat storage. We show that PPTR-1 functions by regulating worm AKT-1 phosphorylation at Thr 350. With striking conservation, mammalian B56beta regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In C. elegans, this ultimately leads to changes in subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. This study reveals a conserved role for the B56 regulatory subunit in regulating insulin signaling through AKT dephosphorylation, thereby having widespread implications in cancer and diabetes research."
19494140,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3f by cyclin-dependent kinase 11 during apoptosis.,"eIF3f is a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). We previously showed that eIF3f is phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase 11 (CDK11(p46)) which is an important effector in apoptosis. Here, we identified a second eIF3f phosphorylation site (Thr119) by CDK11(p46) during apoptosis. We demonstrated that eIF3f is directly phosphorylated by CDK11(p46) in vivo. Phosphorylation of eIF3f plays an important role in regulating its function in translation and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of eIF3f enhances the association of eIF3f with the core eIF3 subunits during apoptosis. Our data suggested that eIF3f may inhibit translation by increasing the binding to the eIF3 complex during apoptosis."
19494150,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Identification of a polymorphism in the RING finger of human Bmi-1 that causes its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.,"Bmi-1 is a polycomb protein that plays an important role in tumor cell development and maintaining stem cell populations of many cell lineages. Here we identify a polymorphism in human Bmi-1 that changes a cysteine within its RING domain to tyrosine. This C18Y polymorphism is associated with a significant decrease in Bmi-1 level and its elevated ubiquitination, suggesting that it is being destroyed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Consistent with this, treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 significantly increases C18Y Bmi-1 levels. This is the first example of a polymorphism in Bmi-1 that reduces levels of this important protein."
19494152,0,Plant J.,9207397,2009,"Interplay between SCARECROW, GA and LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 in ground tissue patterning in the Arabidopsis root.","Regulated cell division is critical for the development of multi-cellular organisms. In the Arabidopsis root, SCARECROW (SCR) is required for the first cell division, but represses the subsequent, longitudinal asymmetric cell divisions that generate the two cell types of the ground tissue - cortex and endodermis. To elucidate the molecular basis of the role of SCR in ground tissue patterning, we screened for SCR-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid method. A number of putative SCR-interacting proteins were identified, among them LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1). In lhp1 mutants, a second longitudinal asymmetric cell division occurs in the ground tissue earlier than in wild-type plants. Similar to the scr mutant, this premature middle cortex phenotype is suppressed by the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). We provide evidence that the N-terminal domain of SCR is required for the interaction between SCR and LHP1 as well as with other interacting partners, and that this domain is essential for repression of asymmetric cell divisions. Consistent with a role for GA in cortex proliferation, mutants of key GA signaling components produce a middle cortex precociously. Intriguingly, we found that the spindly (spy) mutant has a similar middle cortex phenotype. As SPY homologs in animals physically interact with histone deacetylase, we examined the role of histone deacetylation in middle cortex formation. We show that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity causes premature middle cortex formation in wild-type roots. Together, these results suggest that epigenetic regulation is probably the common basis for SCR and GA activity in cortex cell proliferation."
19494201,0,Nature,410462,2009,APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases.,"Naturally occurring axonal pruning and neuronal cell death help to sculpt neuronal connections during development, but their mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Here we report that beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21) activate a widespread caspase-dependent self-destruction program. DR6 is broadly expressed by developing neurons, and is required for normal cell body death and axonal pruning both in vivo and after trophic-factor deprivation in vitro. Unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, we show that axonal degeneration requires caspase 6, which is activated in a punctate pattern that parallels the pattern of axonal fragmentation. DR6 is activated locally by an inactive surface ligand(s) that is released in an active form after trophic-factor deprivation, and we identify APP as a DR6 ligand. Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the shedding of surface APP in a beta-secretase (BACE)-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function studies support a model in which a cleaved amino-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP) binds DR6 and triggers degeneration. Genetic support is provided by a common neuromuscular junction phenotype in mutant mice. Our results indicate that APP and DR6 are components of a neuronal self-destruction pathway, and suggest that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, contributes to Alzheimer's disease."
19494205,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,Arabidopsis photorespiratory serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity requires the mitochondrial accumulation of ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase.,"The dual affinity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase for O(2) and CO(2) results in the net loss of fixed carbon and energy in a process termed photorespiration. The photorespiratory cycle is complex and occurs in three organelles, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, which necessitates multiple steps to transport metabolic intermediates. Genetic analysis has identified a number of mutants exhibiting photorespiratory chlorosis at ambient CO(2), including several with defects in mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) activity. One class of mutants deficient in SHMT1 activity affects SHM1, which encodes the mitochondrial SHMT required for photorespiration. In this work, we describe a second class of SHMT1-deficient mutants defective in a distinct gene, GLU1, which encodes Ferredoxin-dependent Glutamate Synthase (Fd-GOGAT). Fd-GOGAT is a chloroplastic enzyme responsible for the reassimilation of photorespiratory ammonia as well as for primary nitrogen assimilation. We show that Fd-GOGAT is dual targeted to the mitochondria and the chloroplasts. In the mitochondria, Fd-GOGAT interacts physically with SHMT1, and this interaction is necessary for photorespiratory SHMT activity. The requirement of protein-protein interactions and complex formation for photorespiratory SHMT activity demonstrates more complicated regulation of this crucial high flux pathway than anticipated."
19494260,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2009,"Nuclear activity of ROXY1, a glutaredoxin interacting with TGA factors, is required for petal development in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Glutaredoxins (GRXs) have thus far been associated mainly with redox-regulated processes participating in stress responses. However, ROXY1, encoding a GRX, has recently been shown to regulate petal primorida initiation and further petal morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. ROXY1 belongs to a land plant-specific class of GRXs that has a CC-type active site motif, which deviates from ubiquitously occurring CPYC and CGFS GRXs. Expression studies of yellow fluorescent protein-ROXY1 fusion genes driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter reveal a nucleocytoplasmic distribution of ROXY1. We demonstrate that nuclear localization of ROXY1 is indispensable and thus crucial for its activity in flower development. Yeast two-hybrid screens identified TGA transcription factors as interacting proteins, which was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments showing their nuclear interaction in planta. Overlapping expression patterns of ROXY1 and TGA genes during flower development demonstrate that ROXY1/TGA protein interactions can occur in vivo and support their biological relevance in petal development. Deletion analysis of ROXY1 demonstrates the importance of the C terminus for its functionality and for mediating ROXY1/TGA protein interactions. Phenotypic analysis of the roxy1-2 pan double mutant and an engineered chimeric repressor mutant from PERIANTHIA (PAN), a floral TGA gene, supports a dual role of ROXY1 in petal development. Together, our results show that the ROXY1 protein functions in the nucleus, likely by modifying PAN posttranslationally and thereby regulating its activity in petal primordia initiation. Additionally, ROXY1 affects later petal morphogenesis, probably by modulating other TGA factors that might act redundantly during differentiation of second whorl organs."
19494261,1,Cell,413066,2009,Topology and regulation of the human eIF4A/4G/4H helicase complex in translation initiation.,"The RNA helicase eIF4A plays a key role in unwinding of mRNA and scanning during translation initiation. Free eIF4A is a poor helicase and requires the accessory proteins eIF4G and eIF4H. However, the structure of the helicase complex and the mechanisms of stimulation of eIF4A activity have remained elusive. Here we report the topology of the eIF4A/4G/4H helicase complex, which is built from multiple experimentally observed domain-domain contacts. Remarkably, some of the interactions are continuously rearranged during the ATP binding/hydrolysis cycle of the helicase. We show that the accessory proteins modulate the affinity of eIF4A for ATP by interacting simultaneously with both helicase domains and promoting either the closed, ATP-bound conformation or the open, nucleotide-free conformation. The topology of the complex and the spatial arrangement of the RNA-binding surfaces offer insights into their roles in stimulation of helicase activity and the mechanisms of mRNA unwinding and scanning."
19494263,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,Regulation of human myoblast differentiation by PEBP4.,"The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates both myoblast proliferation and differentiation; however, it is unclear how these events are coordinated. Here, we show that human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4), a RAF kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) family protein expressed preferentially in muscle, regulates the activity of the ERK pathway and myoblast differentiation by acting as a scaffold protein. In contrast to RKIP, which disrupts the RAF1-MEK interaction, PEBP4 forms ternary complexes with RAF1 and MEK, and can scaffold this interaction. PEBP4 expression is induced during the differentiation of primary human myoblasts. Consistent with the properties of a scaffold, PEBP4 enhances the RAF1-MEK interaction and the activation of MEK at low expression levels, whereas it inhibits these parameters at higher expression levels. Downregulation of PEBP4 by short hairpin RNA in human myoblasts increases MEK signalling and inhibits differentiation; by contrast, PEBP4 overexpression enhances differentiation. Thus, PEBP4 participates in the control of muscle cell differentiation by modulating the activity of MEK and ERK."
19494292,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,DAP-kinase-mediated phosphorylation on the BH3 domain of beclin 1 promotes dissociation of beclin 1 from Bcl-XL and induction of autophagy.,"Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process, has functions both in cytoprotective and programmed cell death mechanisms. Beclin 1, an essential autophagic protein, was recently identified as a BH3-domain-only protein that binds to Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family members. The dissociation of beclin 1 from its Bcl-2 inhibitors is essential for its autophagic activity, and therefore should be tightly controlled. Here, we show that death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) regulates this process. The activated form of DAPK triggers autophagy in a beclin-1-dependent manner. DAPK phosphorylates beclin 1 on Thr 119 located at a crucial position within its BH3 domain, and thus promotes the dissociation of beclin 1 from Bcl-XL and the induction of autophagy. These results reveal a substrate for DAPK that acts as one of the core proteins of the autophagic machinery, and they provide a new phosphorylation-based mechanism that reduces the interaction of beclin 1 with its inhibitors to activate the autophagic machinery."

In this report, we have conducted a systematic study, using proteomic and genomic approaches, to characterize PITX2-interacting proteins and PITX2-regulating genes. We identified four novel PITX2-associated protein partners Y box binding factor-1, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K, nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U in mass spectrometry analysis. We also found that overexpression of PITX2 upregulated 868 genes (2-25-fold) and downregulated 191 genes (2-15-fold) in DNA microarray analysis. These data provide an insightful perspective for further studying PITX2 function and mechanism of action."
19494322,0,Cell,413066,2009,Large-scale structural analysis of the classical human protein tyrosine phosphatome.,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play a critical role in regulating cellular functions by selectively dephosphorylating their substrates. Here we present 22 human PTP crystal structures that, together with prior structural knowledge, enable a comprehensive analysis of the classical PTP family. Despite their largely conserved fold, surface properties of PTPs are strikingly diverse. A potential secondary substrate-binding pocket is frequently found in phosphatases, and this has implications for both substrate recognition and development of selective inhibitors. Structural comparison identified four diverse catalytic loop (WPD) conformations and suggested a mechanism for loop closure. Enzymatic assays revealed vast differences in PTP catalytic activity and identified PTPD1, PTPD2, and HDPTP as catalytically inert protein phosphatases. We propose a &quot;head-to-toe&quot; dimerization model for RPTPgamma/zeta that is distinct from the &quot;inhibitory wedge&quot; model and that provides a molecular basis for inhibitory regulation. This phosphatome resource gives an expanded insight into intrafamily PTP diversity, catalytic activity, substrate recognition, and autoregulatory self-association."
19494833,0,Cell,413066,2009,A centrosomal Cdc20-APC pathway controls dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons.,"The ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC) recruits the coactivator Cdc20 to drive mitosis in cycling cells. However, the nonmitotic functions of Cdc20-APC have remained unexplored. We report that Cdc20-APC plays an essential role in dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons. Knockdown of Cdc20 in cerebellar slices and in postnatal rats in vivo profoundly impairs the formation of granule neuron dendrite arbors in the cerebellar cortex. Remarkably, Cdc20 is enriched at the centrosome in neurons, and the centrosomal localization is critical for Cdc20-dependent dendrite development. We also find that the centrosome-associated protein histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) promotes the polyubiquitination of Cdc20, stimulates the activity of centrosomal Cdc20-APC, and drives the differentiation of dendrites. These findings define a postmitotic function for Cdc20-APC in the morphogenesis of dendrites in the mammalian brain. The identification of a centrosomal Cdc20-APC ubiquitin signaling pathway holds important implications for diverse biological processes, including neuronal connectivity and plasticity."
19494857,0,Cell,413066,2009,Cotranslational and posttranslational N-glycosylation of polypeptides by distinct mammalian OST isoforms.,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation of polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is catalyzed by the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). OST isoforms with different catalytic subunits (STT3A versus STT3B) and distinct enzymatic properties are coexpressed in mammalian cells. Using siRNA to achieve isoform-specific knockdowns, we show that the OST isoforms cooperate and act sequentially to mediate protein N-glycosylation. The STT3A OST isoform is primarily responsible for cotranslational glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide as it enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The STT3B isoform is required for efficient cotranslational glycosylation of an acceptor site adjacent to the N-terminal signal sequence of a secreted protein. Unlike STT3A, STT3B efficiently mediates posttranslational glycosylation of a carboxyl-terminal glycosylation site in an unfolded protein. These distinct and complementary roles for the OST isoforms allow sequential scanning of polypeptides for acceptor sites to insure the maximal efficiency of N-glycosylation."
19495411,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Interaction of COP1 and UVR8 regulates UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and stress acclimation in Arabidopsis.,"The ultraviolet-B (UV-B) portion of the solar radiation functions as an environmental signal for which plants have evolved specific and sensitive UV-B perception systems. The UV-B-specific UV RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) and the multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) are key regulators of the UV-B response. We show here that uvr8-null mutants are deficient in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and hypersensitive to UV-B stress, whereas overexpression of UVR8 results in enhanced UV-B photomorphogenesis, acclimation and tolerance to UV-B stress. By using sun simulators, we provide evidence at the physiological level that UV-B acclimation mediated by the UV-B-specific photoregulatory pathway is indeed required for survival in sunlight. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the wild type but not the mutant UVR8 and COP1 proteins directly interact in a UV-B-dependent, rapid manner in planta. These data collectively suggest that UV-B-specific interaction of COP1 and UVR8 in the nucleus is a very early step in signalling and responsible for the plant's coordinated response to UV-B ensuring UV-B acclimation and protection in the natural environment."
19495417,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,RNA pol II subunit RPB7 is required for RNA pol I-mediated transcription in Trypanosoma brucei.,"In the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the two main surface glycoprotein genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (pol I) instead of RNA pol II, the polymerase committed to the production of mRNA in eukaryotes. This unusual feature might be accomplished by the recruitment of specific subunits or cofactors that allow pol I to transcribe protein-coding RNAs. Here, we report that transcription mediated by pol I requires TbRPB7, a dissociable subunit of the pol II complex. TbRPB7 was found to interact with two pol I-specific subunits, TbRPA1 and TbRPB6z. Pol I-specific transcription was affected on depletion of TbRPB7 in run-on assays, whereas recombinant TbRPB7 increased transcription driven by a pol I promoter. These results represent a unique example of a functional RNA polymerase chimaera consisting of a core pol I complex that recruits a specific pol II subunit."
19495421,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Oxygen-dependent binding of Nro1 to the prolyl hydroxylase Ofd1 regulates SREBP degradation in yeast.,"Sre1, the fission yeast sterol regulatory element-binding protein, is an ER membrane-bound transcription factor that controls adaptation to low oxygen growth. Under low oxygen, Sre1 is proteolytically cleaved and the N-terminal transcription factor domain (Sre1N) is released from the membrane and enters the nucleus to activate hypoxic gene expression. Ofd1, a prolyl 4-hydroxylase-like 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, controls the oxygen-dependent stability of Sre1N. In the presence of oxygen, Ofd1 accelerates the degradation of Sre1N, but under low oxygen Ofd1 is inhibited and Sre1N accumulates. To identify the regulators of Sre1N, we performed a plasmid-based screen for genes that increased Sre1N transcriptional activity. Here, we identify Nro1 (SPCC4B3.07) as a positive regulator of Sre1N stability and a direct inhibitor of Ofd1. In the absence of oxygen, Nro1 binds to the Ofd1 C-terminal degradation domain and inhibits Sre1N degradation. In the presence of oxygen, Nro1 binding to Ofd1 is disrupted, leading to rapid degradation of Sre1N. We conclude that the Ofd1 dioxygenase domain functions as an oxygen sensor that regulates binding of Nro1 to Ofd1 to control oxygen-dependent Sre1N stability."

Biol.,101235389,2009,An integrated workflow for charting the human interaction proteome: insights into the PP2A system.,"Protein complexes represent major functional units for the execution of biological processes. Systematic affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) yielded a wealth of information on the compendium of protein complexes expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, global AP-MS analysis of human protein complexes is hampered by the low throughput, sensitivity and data robustness of existing procedures, which limit its application for systems biology research. Here, we address these limitations by a novel integrated method, which we applied and benchmarked for the human protein phosphatase 2A system. We identified a total of 197 protein interactions with high reproducibility, showing the coexistence of distinct classes of phosphatase complexes that are linked to proteins implicated in mitosis, cell signalling, DNA damage control and more. These results show that the presented analytical process will substantially advance throughput and reproducibility in future systematic AP-MS studies on human protein complexes."
19496191,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,TRPP2 channels regulate apoptosis through the Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum.,"Ca(2+) is an important signalling molecule that regulates multiple cellular processes, including apoptosis. Although Ca(2+) influx through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the plasma membrane is known to trigger cell death, the function of intracellular TRP proteins in the regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent signalling pathways and apoptosis has remained elusive. Here, we show that TRPP2, the ion channel mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), protects cells from apoptosis by lowering the Ca(2+) concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER-resident TRPP2 counteracts the activity of the sarcoendoplasmic Ca(2+) ATPase by increasing the ER Ca(2+) permeability. This results in diminished cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals upon stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and reduces Ca(2+) release from the ER in response to apoptotic stimuli. Conversely, knockdown of TRPP2 in renal epithelial cells increases ER Ca(2+) release and augments sensitivity to apoptosis. Our findings indicate an important function of ER-resident TRPP2 in the modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) signalling, and provide a molecular mechanism for the increased apoptosis rates in ADPKD upon loss of TRPP2 channel function."
19496197,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Structural basis for translational inhibition by the tumour suppressor Pdcd4.,"Pdcd4 is a tumour suppressor protein. It inhibits translation through interaction with translation initiator eIF4A, resulting in the suppression of neoplastic transformation and tumour invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of an N-terminal-truncated Pdcd4 in free form and in complex with eIF4A. Upon binding to eIF4A, Pdcd4 undergoes a marked conformational change to form a heterotrimeric complex with eIF4A, with one Pdcd4 binding to two eIF4A molecules in two different modes. The binding of Pdcd4 to eIF4A is required to inhibit the enzymatic activity of eIF4A, translation initiation, and AP-1-dependent transcription. Both MA3 domains are required to efficiently compete with the C-terminal domain of eIF4G (eIF4Gc) for binding to eIF4A whereas a single MA3 is sufficient to inhibit translation. Our structural and mutational analyses reveal that Pdcd4 inhibits translation initiation by trapping eIF4A in an inactive conformation, and blocking its incorporation into the eIF4F complex."
19496203,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Ubiquitination directly enhances activity of the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin-3.,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) control the ubiquitination status of proteins in various cellular pathways. Regulation of the activity of DUBs, which is critically important to cellular homoeostasis, can be achieved at the level of gene expression, protein complex formation, or degradation. Here, we report that ubiquitination also directly regulates the activity of a DUB, ataxin-3, a polyglutamine disease protein implicated in protein quality control pathways. Ubiquitination enhances ubiquitin (Ub) chain cleavage by ataxin-3, but does not alter its preference for K63-linked Ub chains. In cells, ubiquitination of endogenous ataxin-3 increases when the proteasome is inhibited, when excess Ub is present, or when the unfolded protein response is induced, suggesting that the cellular functions of ataxin-3 in protein quality control are modulated through ubiquitination. Ataxin-3 is the first reported DUB in which ubiquitination directly regulates catalytic activity. We propose a new function for protein ubiquitination in regulating the activity of certain DUBs and perhaps other enzymes."
19496538,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Recruitment of a chromatin remodelling complex by the Hog1 MAP kinase to stress genes.,"For efficient transcription, RNA PolII must overcome the presence of nucleosomes. The p38-related MAPK Hog1 is an important regulator of transcription upon osmostress in yeast and thereby it is involved in initiation and elongation. However, the role of this protein kinase in elongation has remained unclear. Here, we show that during stress there is a dramatic change in the nucleosome organization of stress-responsive loci that depends on Hog1 and the RSC chromatin remodelling complex. Upon stress, the MAPK Hog1 physically interacts with RSC to direct its association with the ORF of osmo-responsive genes. In RSC mutants, PolII accumulates on stress promoters but not in coding regions. RSC mutants also display reduced stress gene expression and enhanced sensitivity to osmostress. Cell survival under acute osmostress might thus depend on a burst of transcription that in turn could occur only with efficient nucleosome eviction. Our results suggest that the selective targeting of the RSC complex by Hog1 provides the necessary mechanistic basis for this event."
19496558,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain may serve as a targeting signal for the 26S proteasome.,"Recruitment of substrates to the 26S proteasome usually requires covalent attachment of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain. In contrast, modifications with the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain and/or monomeric ubiquitin are generally thought to function in proteasome-independent cellular processes. Nevertheless, the ubiquitin chain-type specificity for the proteasomal targeting is still poorly understood, especially in vivo. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Rsp5, a ubiquitin-ligase in budding yeast, catalyzes the formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Interestingly, the 26S proteasome degraded well the Lys63-linked ubiquitinated substrate in vitro. To examine whether Lys63-linked ubiquitination serves in degradation in vivo, we investigated the ubiquitination of Mga2-p120, a substrate of Rsp5. The polyubiquitinated p120 contained relatively high levels of Lys63-linkages, and the Lys63-linked chains were sufficient for the proteasome-binding and subsequent p120-processing. In addition, Lys63-linked chains as well as Lys48-linked chains were detected in the 26S proteasome-bound polyubiquitinated proteins. These results raise the possibility that Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain also serves as a targeting signal for the 26S proteaseome in vivo."
19496564,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,A positive regulatory role for the mSin3A-HDAC complex in pluripotency through Nanog and Sox2.,"Large networks of proteins govern embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Recent analysis of the critical pluripotency factors Oct4 and Nanog has identified their interaction with multiple transcriptional repression complexes, including members of the mSin3A-HDAC complex, suggesting that these factors could be involved in the regulation of Oct4/Nanog function. mSin3A is critical for embryonic development, but the mechanism by which the mSin3A-HDAC complex is able to regulate ES cell pluripotency is undefined. Herein we show that the mSin3A-HDAC complex positively regulates Nanog expression in ES cells through Sox2, a critical ES cell transcription factor and regulator of Nanog. We have identified the mSin3A-HDAC complex to be present at the Nanog promoter only under proliferating conditions concurrent with histone acetylation. We find that Sox2 associates with mSin3A-HDAC complex members both in vitro and in vivo, similar to the interactions found between Oct4/Nanog and the mSin3A-HDAC complex. Knockdown of mSin3A-HDAC complex members or HDAC inhibitor treatment reduces Nanog expression, and overexpression of mSin3A-HDAC complex subunits stimulates Nanog expression. Our data demonstrate that the mSin3A-HDAC complex can positively regulate Nanog expression under proliferating conditions and that this activity is complementary to mSin3A-mediated p53-dependent silencing of Nanog during differentiation."
19496815,0,Cell,413066,2009,The mechanism of Ca2+ -dependent regulation of kinesin-mediated mitochondrial motility.,"Mitochondria are mobile organelles and cells regulate mitochondrial movement in order to meet the changing energy needs of each cellular region. Ca(2+) signaling, which halts both anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial motion, serves as one regulatory input. Anterograde mitochondrial movement is generated by kinesin-1, which interacts with the mitochondrial protein Miro through an adaptor protein, milton. We show that kinesin is present on all axonal mitochondria, including those that are stationary or moving retrograde. We also show that the EF-hand motifs of Miro mediate Ca(2+)-dependent arrest of mitochondria and elucidate the regulatory mechanism. Rather than dissociating kinesin-1 from mitochondria, Ca(2+)-binding permits Miro to interact directly with the motor domain of kinesin-1, preventing motor/microtubule interactions. Thus, kinesin-1 switches from an active state in which it is bound to Miro only via milton, to an inactive state in which direct binding to Miro prevents its interaction with microtubules. Disrupting Ca(2+)-dependent regulation diminishes neuronal resistance to excitotoxicity."
19497324,0,Cell,413066,2009,SIRT6 links histone H3 lysine 9 deacetylation to NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression and organismal life span.,"Members of the sirtuin (SIRT) family of NAD-dependent deacetylases promote longevity in multiple organisms. Deficiency of mammalian SIRT6 leads to shortened life span and an aging-like phenotype in mice, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that SIRT6 functions at chromatin to attenuate NF-kappaB signaling. SIRT6 interacts with the NF-kappaB RELA subunit and deacetylates histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at NF-kappaB target gene promoters. In SIRT6-deficient cells, hyperacetylation of H3K9 at these target promoters is associated with increased RELA promoter occupancy and enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent modulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Computational genomics analyses revealed increased activity of NF-kappaB-driven gene expression programs in multiple Sirt6-deficient tissues in vivo. Moreover, haploinsufficiency of RelA rescues the early lethality and degenerative syndrome of Sirt6-deficient mice. We propose that SIRT6 attenuates NF-kappaB signaling via H3K9 deacetylation at chromatin, and hyperactive NF-kappaB signaling may contribute to premature and normal aging."
19497791,1,Cell,413066,2009,Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 coordinates telomere elongation during cell-cycle progression.,"Elongation of telomeres by telomerase replenishes the loss of terminal telomeric DNA repeats during each cell cycle. In budding yeast, Cdc13 plays an essential role in telomere length homeostasis, partly through its interactions with both the telomerase complex and the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. Previous studies in yeast have shown that telomere elongation by telomerase is cell cycle dependent, but the mechanism underlying this dependence is unclear. In S. cerevisiae, a single cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28) coordinates the serial events required for the cell division cycle, but no Cdk1 substrate has been identified among telomerase and telomere-associated factors. Here we show that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 is essential for efficient recruitment of the yeast telomerase complex to telomeres by favoring the interaction of Cdc13 with Est1 rather than the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between coordination of telomere elongation and cell-cycle progression in vivo."
19497849,0,Cell,413066,2009,Regulation of PKD by the MAPK p38delta in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.,"Dysfunction and loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells represent hallmarks of diabetes mellitus. Here, we show that mice lacking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38delta display improved glucose tolerance due to enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Deletion of p38delta results in pronounced activation of protein kinase D (PKD), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. p38delta catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of PKD1, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, p38delta null mice are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated beta cell failure. Inhibition of PKD1 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from p38delta-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in p38delta null mice as well as their susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the p38delta-PKD pathway integrates regulation of the insulin secretory capacity and survival of pancreatic beta cells, pointing to a pivotal role for this pathway in the development of overt diabetes mellitus."
19497868,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Sall2 is a novel p75NTR-interacting protein that links NGF signalling to cell cycle progression and neurite outgrowth.,"By screening a fetal brain two-hybrid library with the death domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR), we identified the Sall2 transcription factor as a novel interacting protein. Sall2 is a unique member of the Sall gene family, which is believed to be a tumour suppressor. Here, we show that Sall2 contains a p75NTR interaction domain not found in other Sall proteins and that p75NTR/Sall2 complexes co-immunoprecipitate from brain lysates. NGF dissociates p75NTR/Sall2 complexes and activates TrkA, which has an obligate function in the nuclear translocation of Sall2. NGF also increases Sall2 expression and this is mediated by p75NTR, but may not require TrkA. Depletion of Sall2 from cells decreases the expression and activity of p21(WAF1/CIP1), as well as the ability of NGF to induce growth arrest and the development of neurites. Overexpression of Sall2 activates p21(WAF1/CIP1), induces growth arrest, and promotes neurite outgrowth independently of NGF. These data establish Sall2 as a link between NTRs and transcriptional events that regulate the growth and development of neuronal cells."
19497874,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 requires RNF11 to downregulate NF-kappaB signalling.,"The RING domain protein RNF11 is overexpressed in breast cancers and promotes tumour growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signalling. RNF11 has been proposed to regulate TGF-beta signalling by interacting with HECT- and SCF-type E3 ligases; however, the role of RNF11 in other signalling pathways is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of RNF11 as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathways. Knockdown of RNF11 with siRNA resulted in persistent tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated NF-kappaB and JNK signalling. RNF11 interacted with the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20 and its regulatory protein TAX1BP1 in a stimulus-dependent manner. RNF11 negatively regulated RIP1 and TRAF6 ubiquitination upon stimulation with TNF and LPS, respectively. Furthermore, RNF11 was required for A20 to interact with and inactivate RIP1 to inhibit TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Our studies reveal that RNF11, together with TAX1BP1 and Itch, is an essential component of an A20 ubiquitin-editing protein complex that ensures transient activation of inflammatory signalling pathways."
19497886,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structural basis of UV DNA-damage recognition by the DDB1-DDB2 complex.,"Ultraviolet (UV) light-induced pyrimidine photodimers are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Photolesions have biophysical parameters closely resembling undamaged DNA, impeding discovery through damage surveillance proteins. The DDB1-DDB2 complex serves in the initial detection of UV lesions in vivo. Here we present the structures of the DDB1-DDB2 complex alone and bound to DNA containing either a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimer (6-4PP) lesion or an abasic site. The structure shows that the lesion is held exclusively by the WD40 domain of DDB2. A DDB2 hairpin inserts into the minor groove, extrudes the photodimer into a binding pocket, and kinks the duplex by approximately 40 degrees. The tightly localized probing of the photolesions, combined with proofreading in the photodimer pocket, enables DDB2 to detect lesions refractory to detection by other damage surveillance proteins. The structure provides insights into damage recognition in chromatin and suggests a mechanism by which the DDB1-associated CUL4 ubiquitin ligase targets proteins surrounding the site of damage."
19498109,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2009,"Plk3 interacts with and specifically phosphorylates VRK1 in Ser342, a downstream target in a pathway that induces Golgi fragmentation.","Golgi fragmentation is a process that is necessary to allow its redistribution into daughter cells during mitosis, a process controlled by serine-threonine kinases. This Golgi fragmentation is activated by MEK1 and Plk3. Plk3 is a kinase that is a downstream target in the Golgi fragmentation pathway induced by MEK1 or by nocodazole. In this work, we have identified that Plk3 and VRK1 are two consecutive steps in this signaling pathway. Plk3 interacts with VRK1, forming a stable complex detected by reciprocal immunoprecipitations and pull-down assays; VRK1 colocalizes with giantin in the Golgi apparatus, as Plk3 also does, forming clearly detectable granules. VRK1 does not phosphorylate Plk3, but Plk3 phosphorylates the C-terminal region of VRK1 in Ser342. VRK1 with substitutions in S342 is catalytically active but blocks Golgi fragmentation, indicating that its specific phosphorylation is necessary for this process. The induction of Golgi fragmentation by MEK1 and Plk3 can be inhibited by kinase-dead VRK1, the knockdown of VRK1 by siVRK1, kinase-dead Plk3, or PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor. The Plk3-VRK1 kinase module might represent two consecutive steps of a signaling cascade that participates in the regulation of Golgi fragmentation."
19498465,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,RYBP stabilizes p53 by modulating MDM2.,"The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)-p53 interaction regulates the activity of p53 and is a potential target for human cancer therapy. Here, we report that RYBP (RING1- and YY1-binding protein), a member of the polycomb group (PcG), interacts with MDM2 and decreases MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, leading to stabilization of p53 and an increase in p53 activity. RYBP induces cell-cycle arrest and is involved in the p53 response to DNA damage. Expression of RYBP is decreased in human cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. These results show that RYBP is a new regulator of the MDM2-p53 loop and that it has tumour suppressor activity."
19499923,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2009,Interaction between Arabidopsis Ca2+/H+ exchangers CAX1 and CAX3.,"In plants, high capacity tonoplast cation/H(+) antiport is mediated in part by a family of CAX (cation exchanger) transporters. Functional association between CAX1 and CAX3 has previously been inferred; however, the nature of this interaction has not been established. Here we analyze the formation of &quot;hetero-CAX&quot; complexes and their transport properties. Co-expressing both CAX1 and CAX3 mediated lithium and salt tolerance in yeast, and these phenotypes could not be recapitulated by expression of deregulated versions of either transporter. Coincident expression of Arabidopsis CAX1 and CAX3 occurs during particular stress responses, flowering, and seedling growth. Analysis of cax1, cax3, and cax1/3 seedlings demonstrated similar stress sensitivities. When plants expressed high levels of both CAXs, alterations in transport properties were evident that could not be recapitulated by high level expression of either transporter individually. In planta coimmunoprecipitation suggested that a protein-protein interaction occurred between CAX1 and CAX3. In vivo interaction between the CAX proteins was shown using a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system and gel shift assays. These findings demonstrate cation exchange plasticity through hetero-CAX interactions."
19500394,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,Structure of the transcriptional regulator LmrR and its mechanism of multidrug recognition.,"LmrR is a PadR-related transcriptional repressor that regulates the production of LmrCD, a major multidrug ABC transporter in Lactococcus lactis. Transcriptional regulation is presumed to follow a drug-sensitive induction mechanism involving the direct binding of transporter ligands to LmrR. Here, we present crystal structures of LmrR in an apo state and in two drug-bound states complexed with Hoechst 33342 and daunomycin. LmrR shows a common topology containing a typical beta-winged helix-turn-helix domain with an additional C-terminal helix involved in dimerization. Its dimeric organization is highly unusual with a flat-shaped hydrophobic pore at the dimer centre serving as a multidrug-binding site. The drugs bind in a similar manner with their aromatic rings sandwiched in between the indole groups of two dimer-related tryptophan residues. Multidrug recognition is facilitated by conformational plasticity and the absence of drug-specific hydrogen bonds. Combined analyses using site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence-based drug binding and protein-DNA gel shift assays reveal an allosteric coupling between the multidrug- and DNA-binding sites of LmrR that most likely has a function in the induction mechanism."
19500986,0,Nat. Methods,101215604,2009,Cost-effective strategies for completing the interactome.,"Comprehensive protein-interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here we modeled the cost of interaction-map completion for various experimental designs. We showed that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explored designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding and interaction prediction. The best experimental designs lowered cost by fourfold overall and &gt;100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila melanogaster, in which we mapped 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs. This study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency."
19501044,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,A coordinated phosphorylation cascade initiated by p38MAPK/MSK1 directs RARalpha to target promoters.,"The nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptor alpha (RARalpha) is a transcriptional transregulator that controls the expression of specific gene subsets through binding at response elements and dynamic interactions with coregulators, which are coordinated by the ligand. Here, we highlighted a novel paradigm in which the transcription of RARalpha target genes is controlled by phosphorylation cascades initiated by the rapid RA activation of the p38MAPK/MSK1 pathway. We demonstrate that MSK1 phosphorylates RARalpha at S369 located in the ligand-binding domain, allowing the binding of TFIIH and thereby phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain at S77 by cdk7/cyclin H. MSK1 also phosphorylates histone H3 at S10. Finally, the phosphorylation cascade initiated by MSK1 controls the recruitment of RARalpha/TFIIH complexes to response elements and subsequently RARalpha target gene activation. Cancer cells characterized by a deregulated p38MAPK/MSK1 pathway, do not respond to RA, outlining the essential contribution of the RA-triggered phosphorylation cascade in RA signalling."
19501047,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,RodZ (YfgA) is required for proper assembly of the MreB actin cytoskeleton and cell shape in E. coli.,"The bacterial MreB actin cytoskeleton is required for cell shape maintenance in most non-spherical organisms. In rod-shaped cells such as Escherichia coli, it typically assembles along the long axis in a spiral-like configuration just underneath the cytoplasmic membrane. How this configuration is controlled and how it helps dictate cell shape is unclear. In a new genetic screen for cell shape mutants, we identified RodZ (YfgA) as an important transmembrane component of the cytoskeleton. Loss of RodZ leads to misassembly of MreB into non-spiral structures, and a consequent loss of cell shape. A juxta-membrane domain of RodZ is essential to maintain rod shape, whereas other domains on either side of the membrane have critical, but partially redundant, functions. Though one of these domains resembles a DNA-binding motif, our evidence indicates that it is primarily responsible for association of RodZ with the cytoskeleton."
19501569,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2009,Regulation of growth and survival of activated T cells by cell-transducing inhibitors of Ras.,"We describe the development of cell-penetrating inhibitors of Ras and study their ability to inhibit T cell activation. The inhibitors transduced T cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner and interacted with endogenous Ras. Anti-CD3/CD28-activated cells when treated with the inhibitors, exhibited a notable reduction in cell size, diminished proliferative capacity, and were more prone to apoptosis. Similarly, lymphocytes activated by antigen in vivo, exhibited accelerated apoptosis when treated with the inhibitors ex vivo. Our data reveal a pro-survival role for Ras in activated primary T cells and describe a new methodology for regulating its activity."
19501909,0,Nat. Methods,101215604,2009,An empirical framework for binary interactome mapping.,"Several attempts have been made to systematically map protein-protein interaction, or 'interactome', networks. However, it remains difficult to assess the quality and coverage of existing data sets. Here we describe a framework that uses an empirically-based approach to rigorously dissect quality parameters of currently available human interactome maps. Our results indicate that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (HT-Y2H) interactions for human proteins are more precise than literature-curated interactions supported by a single publication, suggesting that HT-Y2H is suitable to map a significant portion of the human interactome. We estimate that the human interactome contains approximately 130,000 binary interactions, most of which remain to be mapped. Similar to estimates of DNA sequence data quality and genome size early in the Human Genome Project, estimates of protein interaction data quality and interactome size are crucial to establish the magnitude of the task of comprehensive human interactome mapping and to elucidate a path toward this goal."
19502404,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2009,PTEN regulation by Akt-EGR1-ARF-PTEN axis.,"The PTEN tumour suppressor gene is induced by the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor, which also transactivates p53, p73, and p300/CBP as well as other proapoptotic and anti-cancer genes. Here, we describe a novel Akt-EGR1-alternate reading frame (ARF)-PTEN axis, in which PTEN activation in vivo requires p14ARF-mediated sumoylation of EGR1. This modification is dependent on the phosphorylation of EGR1 at S350 and T309 by Akt, which promotes interaction of EGR1 with ARF at K272 in its repressor domain by the ARF/Ubc9/SUMO system. EGR1 sumoylation is decreased by ARF reduction, and no EGR1 sumoylation is detected in ARF(-/-) mice, which also exhibit reduced amounts of PTEN. Our model predicts that perturbation of any of the clinically important tumour suppressors, PTEN, EGR1, and ARF, will cause some degree of dysfunction of the others. These results also explain the known negative feedback regulation by PTEN on its own synthesis through PI3 kinase inhibition."
19502406,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,A COPI coat subunit interacts directly with an early-Golgi localized Arf exchange factor.,"Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family small G proteins are crucial regulators of intracellular transport. The active GTP-bound form of Arf interacts with a set of proteins--effectors--which mediate the downstream signalling events of Arf activation. A well-studied class of Arf1 effectors comprises the coat complexes, such as the cis-Golgi-localized COPI (coat protein complex I) coat, and trans-Golgi network-endosomal clathrin coats. At least five different coats require Arf1-GTP to localize to organelle membranes. How a single Arf protein recruits different coat complexes to distinct membrane sites raises the question of how specificity is achieved. Here, we propose a molecular mechanism of this specificity for the COPI coat by showing a direct and specific interaction between a COPI subunit and a cis-Golgi localized subfamily of Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that takes place independently of Arf1 activation. In this way, a specific output on Arf1 activation can be programmed before the exchange reaction by the GEF itself."
19502408,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,"GAS, a new glutamate-rich protein, interacts differentially with SRCs and is involved in oestrogen receptor function.","Steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) exert profound effects on animal development and physiology. Genetic ablation experiments indicate that various SRC proteins might have differential physiological roles; however, clear evidence of functional specificity has not yet been shown at the molecular level. Here we report the identification of a new SRC1 interacting protein, glutamate-rich coactivator interacting with SRC1 (GAS), which contains a central glutamate-rich region and has transactivation activity. Interestingly, GAS interacts only with SRC1, and not with glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) or amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), the other two members of the SRC family. It interacts with oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and participates in both oestrogen receptor-regulated gene transcription and oestrogen-stimulated G1/S cell-cycle transition. Our data thus indicate that GAS is a new transcription cofactor and that different SRCs are associated with distinct secondary cofactors."
19502421,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,HAB1-SWI3B interaction reveals a link between abscisic acid signaling and putative SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in Arabidopsis.,"Abscisic acid (ABA) has an important role for plant growth, development, and stress adaptation. HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1) is a protein phosphatase type 2C that plays a key role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling; however, the molecular details of HAB1 action in this process are not known. A two-hybrid screen revealed that SWI3B, an Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the yeast SWI3 subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, is a prevalent interacting partner of HAB1. The interaction mapped to the N-terminal half of SWI3B and required an intact protein phosphatase catalytic domain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction of HAB1 and SWI3B in the nucleus of plant cells. swi3b mutants showed a reduced sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and growth and reduced expression of the ABA-responsive genes RAB18 and RD29B. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the presence of HAB1 in the vicinity of RD29B and RAB18 promoters was abolished by ABA, which suggests a direct involvement of HAB1 in the regulation of ABA-induced transcription. Additionally, our results uncover SWI3B as a novel positive regulator of ABA signaling and suggest that HAB1 modulates ABA response through the regulation of a putative SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex."
19502427,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2009,SHARP1/DEC2 inhibits adipogenic differentiation by regulating the activity of C/EBP.,"SHARP1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is expressed in many cell types; however, the mechanisms by which it regulates cellular differentiation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that SHARP1 negatively regulates adipogenesis. Although expression of the early marker CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) is not altered, its crucial downstream targets C/EBPalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) are downregulated by SHARP1. Protein interaction studies confirm that SHARP1 interacts with and inhibits the transcriptional activity of both C/EBPbeta and C/EBPalpha, and enhances the association of C/EBPbeta with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Consistently, in SHARP1-expressing cells, HDAC1 and the histone methyltransferase G9a are retained at the C/EBP regulatory sites on the C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma2 promoters during differentiation, resulting in inhibition of their expression. Interestingly, treatment with troglitazone results in displacement of HDAC1 and G9a, and rescues the differentiation defect of SHARP1-overexpressing cells. Our data indicate that SHARP1 inhibits adipogenesis through the regulation of C/EBP activity, which is essential for PPARgamma-ligand-dependent displacement of co-repressors from adipogenic promoters."
19502726,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structural synergy and molecular crosstalk between bacterial helicase loaders and replication initiators.,"The loading of oligomeric helicases onto replication origins marks an essential step in replisome assembly. In cells, dedicated AAA+ ATPases regulate loading, however, the mechanism by which these factors recruit and deposit helicases has remained unclear. To better understand this process, we determined the structure of the ATPase region of the bacterial helicase loader DnaC from Aquifex aeolicus to 2.7 A resolution. The structure shows that DnaC is a close paralog of the bacterial replication initiator, DnaA, and unexpectedly shares an ability to form a helical assembly similar to that of ATP-bound DnaA. Complementation and ssDNA-binding assays validate the importance of homomeric DnaC interactions, while pull-down experiments show that the DnaC and DnaA AAA+ domains interact in a nucleotide-dependent manner. These findings implicate DnaC as a molecular adaptor that uses ATP-activated DnaA as a docking site for regulating the recruitment and correct spatial deposition of the DnaB helicase onto origins."
19502731,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Circadian clock proteins LHY and CCA1 regulate SVP protein accumulation to control flowering in Arabidopsis.,"The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The GI-CO-FT pathway is highly conserved in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress FT expression under LL."

In developing Arabidopsis leaves it is expressed first in ground cells and then becomes restricted to provascular and procambial cells as venation forms. We isolated proteins interacting with the activated (phosphorylated) cytoplasmic domain of VH1/BRL2, and found that most belong to three processes: proteasome activity, vesicle traffic and intracellular signal transduction. Two adaptor proteins are included that we named VIT [VH1-interacting tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein] and VIK (VH1-interacting kinase), which are co-expressed in the same cells as VH1/BRL2 at two distinct time points in vein differentiation. Mutation of either adaptor or of VH1 results in vein pattern defects and in alterations in response to auxin and brassinosteroids. We propose that these two adaptors facilitate the diversification and amplification of a ligand signal perceived by VH1/BRL2 in multiple downstream pathways affecting venation."
19502743,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,Redox properties of the A-domain of the HMGB1 protein.,"The High Mobility Group B1 (HMGB1) protein plays important roles in both intracellular (reductive) and extracellular (oxidative) environments. We have carried out quantitative investigations of the redox chemistry involving Cys22 and Cys44 of the HMGB1 A-domain, which form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed the real-time kinetics of the redox reactions for the A-domain in glutathione and thioredoxin systems, and also determined the standard redox potential. Thermodynamic experiments showed that the Cys22-Cys44 disulfide bond stabilizes the folded state of the protein. These data suggest that the oxidized HMGB1 may accumulate even in cells under oxidative stress."
19502749,0,Mol. Syst. Biol.,101235389,2008,Hepatitis C virus infection protein network.,"A proteome-wide mapping of interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human proteins was performed to provide a comprehensive view of the cellular infection. A total of 314 protein-protein interactions between HCV and human proteins was identified by yeast two-hybrid and 170 by literature mining. Integration of this data set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins interacting with HCV are enriched in highly central and interconnected proteins. A global analysis on the basis of functional annotation highlighted the enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HCV. A network of proteins associated with frequent clinical disorders of chronically infected patients was constructed by connecting the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGFbeta pathways with cellular proteins targeted by HCV. CORE protein appeared as a major perturbator of this network. Focal adhesion was identified as a new function affected by HCV, mainly by NS3 and NS5A proteins."
19502790,0,Cell,413066,2008,Myosin Vb mobilizes recycling endosomes and AMPA receptors for postsynaptic plasticity.,"Learning-related plasticity at excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain requires the trafficking of AMPA receptors and the growth of dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms that couple plasticity stimuli to the trafficking of postsynaptic cargo are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that myosin Vb (MyoVb), a Ca2+-sensitive motor, conducts spine trafficking during long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. Upon activation of NMDA receptors and corresponding Ca2+ influx, MyoVb associates with recycling endosomes (REs), triggering rapid spine recruitment of endosomes and local exocytosis in spines. Disruption of MyoVb or its interaction with the RE adaptor Rab11-FIP2 abolishes LTP-induced exocytosis from REs and prevents both AMPA receptor insertion and spine growth. Furthermore, induction of tight binding of MyoVb to actin using an acute chemical genetic strategy eradicates LTP in hippocampal slices. Thus, Ca2+-activated MyoVb captures and mobilizes REs for AMPA receptor insertion and spine growth, providing a mechanistic link between the induction and expression of postsynaptic plasticity."
19502802,0,Cancer Cell,101130617,2008,Inactivation of the CYLD deubiquitinase by HPV E6 mediates hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation.,"The biochemical mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activity have remained largely undefined. Here, we find that prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation is restricted to cancer cell lines infected with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes. The HPV-encoded E6 protein is necessary and sufficient for prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation in these systems. The molecular target of E6 in the NF-kappaB pathway is the CYLD lysine 63 (K63) deubiquitinase, a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway. Specifically, hypoxia stimulates E6-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYLD. Given the established role of NF-kappaB in human carcinogenesis, these findings provide a potential molecular/viral link between hypoxia and the adverse clinical outcomes observed in HPV-associated malignancies."
19503074,0,Cell,413066,2008,The RNA polymerase &quot;switch region&quot; is a target for inhibitors.,"The alpha-pyrone antibiotic myxopyronin (Myx) inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, we show that Myx interacts with the RNAP &quot;switch region&quot;--the hinge that mediates opening and closing of the RNAP active center cleft--to prevent interaction of RNAP with promoter DNA. We define the contacts between Myx and RNAP and the effects of Myx on RNAP conformation and propose that Myx functions by interfering with opening of the RNAP active-center cleft during transcription initiation. We further show that the structurally related alpha-pyrone antibiotic corallopyronin (Cor) and the structurally unrelated macrocyclic-lactone antibiotic ripostatin (Rip) function analogously to Myx. The RNAP switch region is distant from targets of previously characterized RNAP inhibitors, and, correspondingly, Myx, Cor, and Rip do not exhibit crossresistance with previously characterized RNAP inhibitors. The RNAP switch region is an attractive target for identification of new broad-spectrum antibacterial therapeutic agents."
19503081,0,Cell,413066,2008,Lid2 is required for coordinating H3K4 and H3K9 methylation of heterochromatin and euchromatin.,"In most eukaryotes, histone methylation patterns regulate chromatin architecture and function: methylation of histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) demarcates heterochromatin, whereas H3K4 methylation demarcates euchromatin. We show here that the S. pombe JmjC-domain protein Lid2 is a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase responsible for H3K4 hypomethylation in heterochromatin. Lid2 interacts with the histone lysine-9 methyltransferase, Clr4, through the Dos1/Clr8-Rik1 complex, which also functions in the RNA interference pathway. Disruption of the JmjC domain alone results in severe heterochromatin defects and depletion of siRNA, whereas overexpressing Lid2 enhances heterochromatin silencing. The physical and functional link between H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation suggests that the two reactions act in a coordinated manner. Surprisingly, crossregulation of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in euchromatin also requires Lid2. We suggest that Lid2 enzymatic activity in euchromatin is regulated through a dynamic interplay with other histone-modification enzymes. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the coordination of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation."
19503088,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Arrestin-like proteins mediate ubiquitination and endocytosis of the yeast metal transporter Smf1.,"Many plasma membrane proteins in yeast are ubiquitinated and endocytosed, but how they are recognized for modification has remained unknown. Here, we show that the manganese transporter Smf1 is endocytosed when cells are exposed to cadmium ions, that this endocytosis depends on Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of specific lysines and that it also requires phosphorylation at nearby sites. This phosphorylation is, however, constitutive rather than stress-induced. Efficient ubiquitination requires Ecm21 or Csr2, two members of a family of arrestin-like yeast proteins that contain several PY motifs and bind to Rsp5. Ecm21 also binds to phosphorylated Smf1, providing a link between Rsp5 and its substrate. PY motif-containing arrestin-like proteins are found in many species, including humans, and might have a general role as ubiquitin ligase adaptors."
19503098,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Blm10 binds to pre-activated proteasome core particles with open gate conformation.,"Blm10 is bound to the yeast proteasome core particle, a crucial protease of eukaryotic cells [corrected]. Two gates, at both ends of the CP, control the access of protein substrates to the catalytic cavity of the CP. Normally, substrate access is auto-inhibited by a closed gate conformation unless regulatory complexes are bound to the CP and translocate protein substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence that Blm10 recognizes pre-activated open gate CPs, which are assumed to exist in an equilibrium with inactive closed gate CP. Consequently, single-capped Blm10-CP shows peptide hydrolysis activity. Under conditions of disturbed CP assembly, as well as in open gate mutants, pre-activated CP or constitutively active CP, respectively, prevail. Then, Blm10 sequesters disordered and open gate CP by forming double-capped Blm10(2)-CP in which peptide hydrolysis activity is repressed. We conclude that Blm10 distinguishes between gate conformations and regulates the activation of CP."
19503600,0,Cell Cycle,101137841,2008,The Polo-like kinase Cdc5 interacts with FEAR network components and Cdc14.,"Exit from mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is triggered by activation of the phosphatase Cdc14. Throughout interphase and early mitosis, Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1. In anaphase, the Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) network and the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) coordinately trigger the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Here we show that the FEAR network component Cdc5 physically associates with two other members of the pathway, the Separase Esp1 and the Esp1-binding protein Slk19. Furthermore, we find that Cdc5 physically interacts with Cdc14 and that this association is mediated by Cdc5's Polo-box domain, a phospho-serine/phosphothreonine binding domain. Finally, we present evidence that the Cdc5-Cdc14 association is direct, further supporting the central role of Cdc5 in Cdc14 localization."
19503602,1,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2009,Putting the brake on FEAR: Tof2 promotes the biphasic release of Cdc14 phosphatase during mitotic exit.,"The completion of chromosome segregation during anaphase requires the hypercondensation of the approximately 1-Mb rDNA array, a reaction dependent on condensin and Cdc14 phosphatase. Using systematic genetic screens, we identified 29 novel genetic interactions with budding yeast condensin. Of these, FOB1, CSM1, LRS4, and TOF2 were required for the mitotic condensation of the tandem rDNA array localized on chromosome XII. Interestingly, whereas Fob1 and the monopolin subunits Csm1 and Lrs4 function in rDNA condensation throughout M phase, Tof2 was only required during anaphase. We show that Tof2, which shares homology with the Cdc14 inhibitor Net1/Cfi1, interacts with Cdc14 phosphatase and its deletion suppresses defects in mitotic exit network (MEN) components. Consistent with these genetic data, the onset of Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was similar in TOF2 and tof2Delta cells; however, the magnitude of the release was dramatically increased in the absence of Tof2, even when the MEN pathway was compromised. These data support a model whereby Tof2 coordinates the biphasic release of Cdc14 during anaphase by restraining a population of Cdc14 in the nucleolus after activation of the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network, for subsequent release by the MEN."
19503791,0,Cell,413066,2008,Global transcriptional repression in C. elegans germline precursors by regulated sequestration of TAF-4.,"In C. elegans, four asymmetric divisions, beginning with the zygote (P0), generate transcriptionally repressed germline blastomeres (P1-P4) and somatic sisters that become transcriptionally active. The protein PIE-1 represses transcription in the later germline blastomeres but not in the earlier germline blastomeres P0 and P1. We show here that OMA-1 and OMA-2, previously shown to regulate oocyte maturation, repress transcription in P0 and P1 by binding to and sequestering in the cytoplasm TAF-4, a component critical for assembly of TFIID and the pol II preinitiation complex. OMA-1/2 binding to TAF-4 is developmentally regulated, requiring phosphorylation by the DYRK kinase MBK-2, which is activated at meiosis II after fertilization. OMA-1/2 are normally degraded after the first mitosis, but ectopic expression of wild-type OMA-1 is sufficient to repress transcription in both somatic and later germline blastomeres. We propose that phosphorylation by MBK-2 serves as a developmental switch, converting OMA-1/2 from oocyte to embryo regulators."
19503814,0,Cell,413066,2008,ACF7 regulates cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics and migration and has ATPase activity.,"Coordinated interactions between microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons are involved in many polarized cellular processes. Spectraplakins are enormous (&gt;500 kDa) proteins able to bind both MTs and actin filaments (F-actin) directly. To elucidate the physiological significance and functions of mammalian spectraplakin ACF7, we've conditionally targeted it in skin epidermis. Intriguingly, ACF7 deficiency compromises the targeting of microtubules along F-actin to focal adhesions (FAs), stabilizes FA-actin networks, and impairs epidermal migration. Exploring underlying mechanisms, we show that ACF7's binding domains for F-actin, MTs, and MT plus-end proteins are not sufficient to rescue the defects in FA-cytoskeletal dynamics and migration functions of ACF7 null keratinocytes. We've uncovered an intrinsic actin-regulated ATPase domain in ACF7 and demonstrate that it is both functional and essential for these roles. Our findings provide insight into the functions of this important cytoskeletal crosslinking protein in regulating dynamic interactions between MTs and F-actin to sustain directional cell movement."
19503832,1,Cell,413066,2008,Mre11 dimers coordinate DNA end bridging and nuclease processing in double-strand-break repair.,"Mre11 forms the core of the multifunctional Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex that detects DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), activates the ATM checkpoint kinase, and initiates homologous recombination (HR) repair of DSBs. To define the roles of Mre11 in both DNA bridging and nucleolytic processing during initiation of DSB repair, we combined small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and crystal structures of Pyrococcus furiosus Mre11 dimers bound to DNA with mutational analyses of fission yeast Mre11. The Mre11 dimer adopts a four-lobed U-shaped structure that is critical for proper MRN complex assembly and for binding and aligning DNA ends. Further, mutations blocking Mre11 endonuclease activity impair cell survival after DSB induction without compromising MRN complex assembly or Mre11-dependant recruitment of Ctp1, an HR factor, to DSBs. These results show how Mre11 dimerization and nuclease activities initiate repair of DSBs and collapsed replication forks, as well as provide a molecular foundation for understanding cancer-causing Mre11 mutations in ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD)."
19503837,0,Cell,413066,2008,Mre11 nuclease activity has essential roles in DNA repair and genomic stability distinct from ATM activation.,"The Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 (MRN) complex maintains genomic stability by bridging DNA ends and initiating DNA damage signaling through activation of the ATM kinase. Mre11 possesses DNA nuclease activities that are highly conserved in evolution but play unknown roles in mammals. To define the functions of Mre11, we engineered targeted mouse alleles that either abrogate nuclease activities or inactivate the entire MRN complex. Mre11 nuclease deficiency causes a striking array of phenotypes indistinguishable from the absence of MRN, including early embryonic lethality and dramatic genomic instability. We identify a crucial role for the nuclease activities in homology-directed double-strand-break repair and a contributing role in activating the ATR kinase. However, the nuclease activities are not required to activate ATM after DNA damage or telomere deprotection. Therefore, nucleolytic processing by Mre11 is an essential function of fundamental importance in DNA repair, distinct from MRN control of ATM signaling."
19503843,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Histone H2B monoubiquitination in the chromatin of FLOWERING LOCUS C regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis.,"Ubiquitination is one of many known histone modifications that regulate gene expression. Here, we examine the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the yeast E2 and E3 enzymes responsible for H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1). Arabidopsis has two E3 homologs (HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 [HUB1] and HUB2) and three E2 homologs (UBIQUITIN CARRIER PROTEIN [UBC1] to UBC3). hub1 and hub2 mutants show the loss of H2Bub1 and early flowering. By contrast, single ubc1, ubc2, or ubc3 mutants show no flowering defect; only ubc1 ubc2 double mutants, and not double mutants with ubc3, show early flowering and H2Bub1 defects. This suggests that ubc1 and ubc2 are redundant, but ubc3 is not involved in flowering time regulation. Protein interaction analysis showed that HUB1 and HUB2 interact with each other and with UBC1 and UBC2, as well as self-associating. The expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and its homologs was repressed in hub1, hub2, and ubc1 ubc2 mutant plants. Association of H2Bub1 with the chromatin of FLC clade genes depended on UBC1,2 and HUB1,2, as did the dynamics of methylated histones H3K4me3 and H3K36me2. The monoubiquitination of H2B via UBC1,2 and HUB1,2 represents a novel form of histone modification that is involved in flowering time regulation."
19504496,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,A cyclophilin links redox and light signals to cysteine biosynthesis and stress responses in chloroplasts.,"Cyclophilins belong to a large family of enzymes called &quot;peptidyl prolyl isomerases&quot; that assist protein folding and assembly. The cyclophilin CYP20-3 (also known as &quot;ROC4&quot;) is the only member of this group located in the stroma (soluble phase) of chloroplasts. In the present study we isolated mutant Arabidopsis plants defective in the CYP20-3 gene and found them to be hypersensitive to oxidative stress conditions created by high light levels, rose bengal, high salt levels, and osmotic shock. Chloroplast serine acetyltransferase (SAT1), a rate-limiting enzyme in cysteine biosynthesis, was identified as an interacting partner for CYP20-3 by protein interaction analyses. In the present experiments, SAT1 activity increased significantly under conditions of light and oxidative stress in concert with total thiols in wild-type plants. By contrast, these parameters changed only marginally in experiments with the cyp20-3 mutant, suggesting that CYP20-3 links light and stress to SAT1 activity and cysteine biosynthesis. In further support of this conclusion, our analyses showed that the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of the mutant developed under illumination and not in the dark. Together with the earlier report that CYP20-3 foldase activity is enhanced by thioredoxin-mediated reduction, our findings suggest that CYP20-3 links photosynthetic electron transport and redox regulation to the folding of SAT1, thereby enabling the cysteine-based thiol biosynthesis pathway to adjust to light and stress conditions."
19505066,0,J. Exp. Bot.,9882906,2008,Ethylene- and pathogen-inducible Arabidopsis acyl-CoA-binding protein 4 interacts with an ethylene-responsive element binding protein.,"Six genes encode proteins with acyl-CoA-binding domains in Arabidopsis thaliana. They are the small 10-kDa cytosolic acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), membrane-associated ACBP1 and ACBP2, extracellularly-targeted ACBP3, and kelch-motif containing ACBP4 and ACBP5. Here, the interaction of ACBP4 with an A. thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The subcellular localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion. Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET analysis. Immuno-electron microscopy on Arabidopsis sections not only localized ACBP4 to the cytosol but also to the periphery of the nucleus upon closer examination, perhaps as a result of its interaction with AtEBP. Furthermore, the expression of ACBP4 and AtEBP in Northern blot analyses was induced by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, methyl jasmonate treatments, and Botrytis cinerea infection, suggesting that the interaction of ACBP4 and AtEBP may be related to AtEBP-mediated defence possibly via ethylene and/or jasmonate signalling."
19505071,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2008,"F-box protein DOR functions as a novel inhibitory factor for abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure under drought stress in Arabidopsis,.","Guard cells, which form stoma in leaf epidermis, sense and integrate environmental signals to modulate stomatal aperture in response to diverse conditions. Under drought stress, plants synthesize abscisic acid (ABA), which in turn induces a rapid closing of stoma, to prevent water loss by transpiration. However, many aspects of the molecular mechanism for ABA-mediated stomatal closure are still not understood. Here, we report a novel negative regulator of guard cell ABA signaling, DOR, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The DOR gene encodes a putative F-box protein, a member of the S-locus F-box-like family related to AhSLF-S(2) and specifically interacting with ASK14 and CUL1. A null mutation in DOR resulted in a hypersensitive ABA response of stomatal closing and a substantial increase of drought tolerance; in contrast, the transgenic plants overexpressing DOR were more susceptible to the drought stress. DOR is strongly expressed in guard cells and suppressed by ABA treatment, suggesting a negative feedback loop of DOR in ABA responses. Double-mutant analyses of dor with ABA-insensitive mutant abi1-1 showed that abi1-1 is epistatic to dor, but no apparent change of phospholipase Dalpha1 was detected between the wild type and dor. Affymetrix GeneChip analysis showed that DOR likely regulates ABA biosynthesis under drought stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DOR acts independent of phospholipase Dalpha1 in an ABA signaling pathway to inhibit the ABA-induced stomatal closure under drought stress."

However, the development of Bcl-2 converters as anticancer therapeutics has not been explored. Here we report the identification of a Nur77-derived Bcl-2-converting peptide with 9 amino acids (NuBCP-9) and its enantiomer, which induce apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and in animals. The apoptotic effect of NuBCPs and their activation of Bax are not inhibited but rather potentiated by Bcl-2. NuBCP-9 and its enantiomer bind to the Bcl-2 loop, which shares the characteristics of structurally adaptable regions with many cancer-associated and signaling proteins. NuBCP-9s act as molecular switches to dislodge the Bcl-2 BH4 domain, exposing its BH3 domain, which in turn blocks the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-X(L)."

Unveiling the cross talks between SGT1 and other co-chaperones such as p23, AHA1 (Activator of HSP90 ATPase 1) or RAR1 (Required for Mla12 resistance) is an important step towards understanding the HSP90 machinery. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mutational analyses of HSP90 revealed the nature of its binding with the CS domain of SGT1. Although CS is structurally similar to p23, these domains were found to non-competitively bind to various regions of HSP90; yet, unexpectedly, full-length SGT1 could displace p23 from HSP90. RAR1 partly shares the same binding site with HSP90 as the CS domain, whereas AHA1 does not. This analysis allowed us to build a structural model of the HSP90-SGT1 complex and to obtain a compensatory mutant pair between both partners that is able to restore virus resistance in vivo through Rx (Resistance to potato virus X) immune sensor stabilization."

Here, we show that Strap regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase 2), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Strap. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas Chk2 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the p53 response."
19505314,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Proteolysis-independent downregulation of DELLA repression in Arabidopsis by the gibberellin receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1.,"This article presents evidence that DELLA repression of gibberellin (GA) signaling is relieved both by proteolysis-dependent and -independent pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. DELLA proteins are negative regulators of GA responses, including seed germination, stem elongation, and fertility. GA stimulates GA responses by causing DELLA repressor degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. DELLA degradation requires GA biosynthesis, three functionally redundant GA receptors GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1a, b, and c), and the SLEEPY1 (SLY1) F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. The sly1 mutants accumulate more DELLA proteins but display less severe dwarf and germination phenotypes than the GA biosynthesis mutant ga1-3 or the gid1abc triple mutant. Interestingly, GID1 overexpression rescued the sly1 dwarf and infertility phenotypes without decreasing the accumulation of the DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF ga1-3. GID1 rescue of sly1 mutants was dependent on the level of GID1 protein, GA, and the presence of a functional DELLA motif. Since DELLA shows increasing interaction with GID1 with increasing GA levels, it appears that GA-bound GID1 can block DELLA repressor activity by direct protein-protein interaction with the DELLA domain. Thus, a SLY1-independent mechanism for GA signaling may function without DELLA degradation."

Sci.,52457,2008,Murine CENPF interacts with syntaxin 4 in the regulation of vesicular transport.,"Syntaxin 4 is a component of the SNARE complex that regulates membrane docking and fusion. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identify a novel interaction between syntaxin 4 and cytoplasmic murine CENPF, a protein previously demonstrated to associate with the microtubule network and SNAP-25. The binding domain for syntaxin 4 in CENPF was defined by yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal analyses in cell culture reveal a high degree of colocalization between endogenously expressed proteins in interphase cells. Additionally, the endogenous SNARE proteins can be isolated as a complex with CENPF in immunoprecipitation experiments. Further analyses demonstrate that murine CENPF and syntaxin 4 colocalize with components of plasma membrane recycling: SNAP-25 and VAMP2. Depletion of endogenous CENPF disrupts GLUT4 trafficking whereas expression of a dominant-negative form of CENPF inhibits cell coupling. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that CENPF provides a direct link between proteins of the SNARE system and the microtubule network and indicate a diverse role for murine CENPF in vesicular transport."

Adhesive complexes composed of microneme proteins (MICs) are secreted onto the parasite surface from intracellular stores and fulfil crucial roles in host-cell recognition, attachment and penetration. Here, we report the high-resolution solution structure of a complex between two crucial MICs, TgMIC6 and TgMIC1. Furthermore, we identify two analogous interaction sites within separate epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains of TgMIC6-EGF2 and EGF3-and confirm that both interactions are functional for the recognition of host cell receptor in the parasite, using immunofluorescence and invasion assays. The nature of this new mode of recognition of the EGF domain and its abundance in apicomplexan surface proteins suggest a more generalized means of constructing functional assemblies by using EGF domains with highly specific receptor-binding properties."

G-protein-coupled pathways are involved in sugar signaling in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana regulator of G-protein signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1) combines a receptor-like seven transmembrane domain with an RGS domain, interacts with the Arabidopsis Galpha subunit (AtGPA1) in a d-glucose-regulated manner, and stimulates AtGPA1 GTPase activity. We determined that AtRGS1 interacts with additional components, genetically defined here, to serve as a plasma membrane sensor for d-glucose. This interaction between AtRGS1 and AtGPA1 involves, in part, the seven-transmembrane domain of AtRGS1."

Kinases that are associated with the receptors or are part of the receptors themselves modulate signaling through phosphorylation events. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) XA21 receptor kinase is a key recognition and signaling determinant in the innate immune response. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15). The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. XB15 fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and from transgenic rice carry PP2C activity. Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner. A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding. Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance. Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response."
19506028,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Sexual and apomictic seed formation in Hieracium requires the plant polycomb-group gene FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM.,"A Polycomb-Group (PcG) complex, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS), represses endosperm development in Arabidopsis thaliana until fertilization occurs. The Hieracium genus contains apomictic species that form viable seeds asexually. To investigate FIS function during apomictic seed formation, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), encoding a WD-repeat member of the FIS complex, was isolated and downregulated in sexual and apomictic Hieracium species. General downregulation led to defects in leaf and seed development, consistent with a role in developmental transitions and cell fate. PcG-like activity of Hieracium FIE was also supported by its interaction in vitro with the Arabidopsis CURLY LEAF PcG protein. By contrast, specific downregulation of FIE in developing seeds of sexual Hieracium did not result in autonomous endosperm proliferation but led to seed abortion after cross-pollination. Furthermore, in apomictic Hieracium, specific FIE downregulation inhibited autonomous embryo and endosperm initiation, and most autonomous seeds displayed defective embryo and endosperm growth. Therefore, FIE is required for both apomictic and fertilization-induced seed initiation in Hieracium. Since Hieracium FIE failed to interact with FIS class proteins in vitro, its partner proteins might differ from those in the FIS complex of Arabidopsis. These differences in protein interaction were attributed to structural modifications predicted from comparisons of Arabidopsis and Hieracium FIE molecular models."
19506029,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Arabidopsis ARC6 coordinates the division machineries of the inner and outer chloroplast membranes through interaction with PDV2 in the intermembrane space.,"Chloroplasts arose from a free-living cyanobacterial endosymbiont and divide by binary fission. Division involves the assembly and constriction of the endosymbiont-derived, tubulin-like FtsZ ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane and the host-derived, dynamin-like ARC5 ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane. Despite the identification of many proteins required for plastid division, the factors coordinating the internal and external division machineries are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that this coordination is mediated in Arabidopsis thaliana by an interaction between ARC6, an FtsZ assembly factor spanning the inner envelope membrane, and PDV2, an ARC5 recruitment factor spanning the outer envelope membrane. ARC6 and PDV2 interact via their C-terminal domains in the intermembrane space, consistent with their in vivo topologies. ARC6 acts upstream of PDV2 to localize PDV2 (and hence ARC5) to the division site. We present a model whereby ARC6 relays information on stromal FtsZ ring positioning through PDV2 to the chloroplast surface to specify the site of ARC5 recruitment. Because orthologs of ARC6 occur in land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria but PDV2 occurs only in land plants, the connection between ARC6 and PDV2 represents the evolution of a plant-specific adaptation to coordinate the assembly and activity of the endosymbiont- and host-derived plastid division components."
19506073,0,Cell,413066,2008,A double S shape provides the structural basis for the extraordinary binding specificity of Dscam isoforms.,"Drosophila Dscam encodes a vast family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing proteins that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding. This diversity is essential for cell recognition events required for wiring the brain. Each isoform binds to itself but rarely to other isoforms. Specificity is determined by &quot;matching&quot; of three variable Ig domains within an approximately 220 kD ectodomain. Here, we present the structure of the homophilic binding region of Dscam, comprising the eight N-terminal Ig domains (Dscam(1-8)). Dscam(1-8) forms a symmetric homodimer of S-shaped molecules. This conformation, comprising two reverse turns, allows each pair of the three variable domains to &quot;match&quot; in an antiparallel fashion. Structural, genetic, and biochemical studies demonstrate that, in addition to variable domain &quot;matching,&quot; intramolecular interactions between constant domains promote homophilic binding. These studies provide insight into how &quot;matching&quot; at all three pairs of variable domains in Dscam mediates isoform-specific recognition."
19506076,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structural insights into NEDD8 activation of cullin-RING ligases: conformational control of conjugation.,"Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) comprise the largest ubiquitin E3 subclass, in which a central cullin subunit links a substrate-binding adaptor with an E2-binding RING. Covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to a conserved C-terminal domain (ctd) lysine stimulates CRL ubiquitination activity and prevents binding of the inhibitor CAND1. Here we report striking conformational rearrangements in the crystal structure of NEDD8~Cul5(ctd)-Rbx1 and SAXS analysis of NEDD8~Cul1(ctd)-Rbx1 relative to their unmodified counterparts. In NEDD8ylated CRL structures, the cullin WHB and Rbx1 RING subdomains are dramatically reoriented, eliminating a CAND1-binding site and imparting multiple potential catalytic geometries to an associated E2. Biochemical analyses indicate that the structural malleability is important for both CRL NEDD8ylation and subsequent ubiquitination activities. Thus, our results point to a conformational control of CRL activity, with ligation of NEDD8 shifting equilibria to disfavor inactive CAND1-bound closed architectures, and favor dynamic, open forms that promote polyubiquitination."
19506082,1,Cell,413066,2008,"A self-associating protein critical for chromosome attachment, division, and polar organization in caulobacter.","Cell polarization is an integral part of many unrelated bacterial processes. How intrinsic cell polarization is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that Caulobacter crescentus uses a multimeric pole-organizing factor (PopZ) that serves as a hub to concurrently achieve several polarizing functions. During chromosome segregation, polar PopZ captures the ParB*ori complex and thereby anchors sister chromosomes at opposite poles. This step is essential for stabilizing bipolar gradients of a cell division inhibitor and setting up division near midcell. PopZ also affects polar stalk morphogenesis and mediates the polar localization of the morphogenetic and cell cycle signaling proteins CckA and DivJ. Polar accumulation of PopZ, which is central to its polarizing activity, can be achieved independently of division and does not appear to be dictated by the pole curvature. Instead, evidence suggests that localization of PopZ largely relies on PopZ multimerization in chromosome-free regions, consistent with a self-organizing mechanism."
19506248,0,Cell,413066,2008,A polymeric protein anchors the chromosomal origin/ParB complex at a bacterial cell pole.,"Bacterial replication origins move towards opposite ends of the cell during DNA segregation. We have identified a proline-rich polar protein, PopZ, required to anchor the separated Caulobacter crescentus chromosome origins at the cell poles, a function that is essential for maintaining chromosome organization and normal cell division. PopZ interacts directly with the ParB protein bound to specific DNA sequences near the replication origin. As the origin/ParB complex is being replicated and moved across the cell, PopZ accumulates at the cell pole and tethers the origin in place upon arrival. The polar accumulation of PopZ occurs by a diffusion/capture mechanism that requires the MreB cytoskeleton. High molecular weight oligomers of PopZ assemble in vitro into a filamentous network with trimer junctions, suggesting that the PopZ network and ParB-bound DNA interact in an adhesive complex, fixing the chromosome origin at the cell pole."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome: photoconversion and signal transduction.,"Phytochromes are red-light photoreceptors that regulate light responses in plants, fungi, and bacteria via reversible photoconversion between red (Pr) and far-red (Pfr) light-absorbing states. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.9 A resolution of a bacteriophytochrome from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an intact, fully photoactive photosensory core domain in its dark-adapted Pfr state. This structure reveals how unusual interdomain interactions, including a knot and an &quot;arm&quot; structure near the chromophore site, bring together the PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim), GAF (cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA), and PHY (phytochrome) domains to achieve Pr/Pfr photoconversion. The PAS, GAF, and PHY domains have topologic elements in common and may have a single evolutionary origin. We identify key interactions that stabilize the chromophore in the Pfr state and provide structural and mutational evidence to support the essential role of the PHY domain in efficient Pr/Pfr photoconversion. We also identify a pair of conserved residues that may undergo concerted conformational changes during photoconversion. Modeling of the full-length bacteriophytochrome structure, including its output histidine kinase domain, suggests how local structural changes originating in the photosensory domain modulate interactions between long, cross-domain signaling helices at the dimer interface and are transmitted to the spatially distant effector domain, thereby regulating its histidine kinase activity."
19506256,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Identification of COUP-TFII orphan nuclear receptor as a retinoic acid-activated receptor.,"The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFI and II) make up the most conserved subfamily of nuclear receptors that play key roles in angiogenesis, neuronal development, organogenesis, cell fate determination, and metabolic homeostasis. Although the biological functions of COUP-TFs have been studied extensively, little is known of their structural features or aspects of ligand regulation. Here we report the ligand-free 1.48 A crystal structure of the human COUP-TFII ligand-binding domain. The structure reveals an autorepressed conformation of the receptor, where helix alpha10 is bent into the ligand-binding pocket and the activation function-2 helix is folded into the cofactor binding site, thus preventing the recruitment of coactivators. In contrast, in multiple cell lines, COUP-TFII exhibits constitutive transcriptional activity, which can be further potentiated by nuclear receptor coactivators. Mutations designed to disrupt cofactor binding, dimerization, and ligand binding, substantially reduce the COUP-TFII transcriptional activity. Importantly, retinoid acids are able to promote COUP-TFII to recruit coactivators and activate a COUP-TF reporter construct. Although the concentration needed is higher than the physiological levels of retinoic acids, these findings demonstrate that COUP-TFII is a ligand-regulated nuclear receptor, in which ligands activate the receptor by releasing it from the autorepressed conformation."

Cell Biol.,375356,2008,"Regulation of Sli15/INCENP, kinetochore, and Cdc14 phosphatase functions by the ribosome biogenesis protein Utp7.","The Sli15-Ipl1-Bir1 chromosomal passenger complex is essential for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment and spindle stability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During early anaphase, release of the Cdc14 protein phosphatase from the nucleolus leads to the dephosphorylation of Sli15 and redistribution of this complex from kinetochores to the spindle. We show here that the predominantly nucleolar ribosome biogenesis protein Utp7 is also present at kinetochores and is required for normal organization of kinetochore proteins and proper chromosome segregation. Utp7 associates with and regulates the localization of Sli15 and Cdc14. Before anaphase onset, it prevents the premature nucleolar release of Cdc14 and the premature concentration of Sli15 on the spindle. Furthermore, Utp7 can regulate the localization and phosphorylation status of Sli15 independent of its effect on Cdc14 function. Thus, Utp7 is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in the vital cellular processes of ribosome biogenesis, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle control."
19506260,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,The zinc-binding protein Hot13 promotes oxidation of the mitochondrial import receptor Mia40.,"A disulphide relay system mediates the import of cysteine-containing proteins into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. This system consists of two essential proteins, Mia40 and Erv1, which bind to newly imported proteins by disulphide transfer. A third component, Hot13, was proposed to be important in the biogenesis of cysteine-rich proteins of the intermembrane space, but the molecular function of Hot13 remained unclear. Here, we show that Hot13, a conserved zinc-binding protein, interacts functionally and physically with the import receptor Mia40. It improves the Erv1-dependent oxidation of Mia40 both in vivo and in vitro. As a consequence, in mutants lacking Hot13, the import of substrates of Mia40 is impaired, particularly in the presence of zinc ions. In mitochondria as well as in vitro, Hot13 can be functionally replaced by zinc-binding chelators. We propose that Hot13 maintains Mia40 in a zinc-free state, thereby facilitating its efficient oxidation by Erv1."
19506556,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Structural basis for DNA recognition by FoxO1 and its regulation by posttranslational modification.,"FoxO transcription factors regulate the transcription of genes that control metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and possibly life span. A number of posttranslational modifications within the forkhead DNA-binding domain regulate FoxO-mediated transcription. We describe the crystal structures of FoxO1 bound to three different DNA elements and measure the change in FoxO1-DNA affinity with acetylation and phosphorylation. The structures reveal additional contacts and increased DNA distortion for the highest affinity DNA site. The flexible wing 2 region of the forkhead domain was not observed in the structures but is necessary for DNA binding, and we show that p300 acetylation in wing 2 reduces DNA affinity. We also show that MST1 phosphorylation of FoxO1 prevents high-affinity DNA binding. The observation that FoxO-DNA affinity varies between response elements and with posttranslational modifications suggests that modulation of FoxO-DNA affinity is an important component of FoxO regulation in health and misregulation in disease."
19507861,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Insights into the mode of action of a putative zinc transporter CzrB in Thermus thermophilus.,"The crystal structures of the cytoplasmic domain of the putative zinc transporter CzrB in the apo and zinc-bound forms reported herein are consistent with the protein functioning in vivo as a homodimer. NMR, X-ray scattering, and size-exclusion chromatography provide support for dimer formation. Full-length variants of CzrB in the apo and zinc-loaded states were generated by homology modeling with the Zn2+/H+ antiporter YiiP. The model suggests a way in which zinc binding to the cytoplasmic fragment creates a docking site to which a metallochaperone can bind for delivery and transport of its zinc cargo. Because the cytoplasmic domain may exist in the cell as an independent, soluble protein, a proposal is advanced that it functions as a metallochaperone and that it regulates the zinc-transporting activity of the full-length protein. The latter requires that zinc binding becomes uncoupled from the creation of a metallochaperone-docking site on CzrB."
19508234,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Structural insights into intermediate steps in the Sir2 deacetylation reaction.,"Sirtuin enzymes comprise a unique class of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases. Although structures of many sirtuin complexes have been determined, structural resolution of intermediate chemical steps are needed to understand the deacetylation mechanism. We report crystal structures of the bacterial sirtuin, Sir2Tm, in complex with an S-alkylamidate intermediate, analogous to the naturally occurring O-alkylamidate intermediate, and a Sir2Tm ternary complex containing a dissociated NAD(+) analog and acetylated peptide. The structures and biochemical studies reveal critical roles for the invariant active site histidine in positioning the reaction intermediate, and for a conserved phenylalanine residue in shielding reaction intermediates from base exchange with nicotinamide. The new structural and biochemical studies provide key mechanistic insight into intermediate steps of the Sir2 deacetylation reaction."
19508732,0,Int. J. Biol. Sci.,101235568,2008,"SIRT3 interacts with the daf-16 homolog FOXO3a in the mitochondria, as well as increases FOXO3a dependent gene expression.","Cellular longevity is a complex process relevant to age-related diseases including but not limited to chronic illness such as diabetes and metabolic syndromes. Two gene families have been shown to play a role in the genetic regulation of longevity; the Sirtuin and FOXO families. It is also established that nuclear Sirtuins interact with and under specific cellular conditions regulate the activity of FOXO gene family proteins. Thus, we hypothesize that a mitochondrial Sirtuin (SIRT3) might also interact with and regulate the activity of the FOXO proteins. To address this we used HCT116 cells overexpressing either wild-type or a catalytically inactive dominant negative SIRT3. For the first time we establish that FOXO3a is also a mitochondrial protein and forms a physical interaction with SIRT3 in mitochondria. Overexpression of a wild-type SIRT3 gene increase FOXO3a DNA-binding activity as well as FOXO3a dependent gene expression. Biochemical analysis of HCT116 cells over expressing the deacetylation mutant, as compared to wild-type SIRT3 gene, demonstrated an overall oxidized intracellular environment, as monitored by increase in intracellular superoxide and oxidized glutathione levels. As such, we propose that SIRT3 and FOXO3a comprise a potential mitochondrial signaling cascade response pathway."
19508862,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Arabidopsis WRKY38 and WRKY62 transcription factors interact with histone deacetylase 19 in basal defense.,"Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY38 and WRKY62, encoding two structurally similar type III WRKY transcription factors, are induced in a Nonexpressor of PR Gene1 (NPR1)-dependent manner by salicylic acid (SA) or by virulent Pseudomonas syringae. Disease resistance and SA-regulated Pathogenesis-Related1 (PR1) gene expression are enhanced in the wrky38 and wrky62 single mutants and, to a greater extent, in the double mutants. Overexpression of WRKY38 or WRKY62 reduces disease resistance and PR1 expression. Thus, WRKY38 and WRKY62 function additively as negative regulators of plant basal defense. WRKY38 and WRKY62 interact with Histone Deacetylase 19 (HDA19). Expression of HDA19 is also induced by P. syringae, and the stability of its induced transcripts depends on SA and NPR1 in infected plants. Disruption of HDA19 leads to compromised resistance, whereas its overexpression results in enhanced resistance to P. syringae. Thus, HDA19 has a role opposite from those of WRKY38 and WRKY62 in basal resistance to the bacterial pathogen. Both WRKY38 and WRKY62 are transcriptional activators in plant cells, but their activation activities are abolished by overexpressed HDA19. Interaction of WRKY38 and WRKY62 with HDA19 may act to fine-tune plant basal defense responses."
19509054,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,African swine fever virus protein p30 interaction with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) during infection.,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) was identified as interacting cellular protein with the abundant immediate early protein p30 from African swine fever virus (ASFV) in a macrophage cDNA library screening. The interacting regions of hnRNP-K with p30 were established within residues 35-197, which represent KH1 and KH2 domains responsible for RNA binding. Colocalization of hnRNP-K and p30 was observed mainly in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm of infected cells and infection modified hnRNP-K subcellular distribution and decreased the incorporation of 5-fluorouridine into nascent RNA. Since similar effects were observed in cells transiently expressing p30, this interaction provides new insights into p30 function and could represent a possible additional mechanism by which ASFV downregulates host cell mRNA translation."
19509055,1,Cell,413066,2008,Molecular basis for the sorting of the SNARE VAMP7 into endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles by the ArfGAP Hrb.,"SNAREs provide the specificity and energy for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane, but how they are sorted into the appropriate vesicles on post-Golgi trafficking pathways is largely unknown. We demonstrate that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the SNARE VAMP7 is directly mediated by Hrb, a clathrin adaptor and ArfGAP. Hrb wraps 20 residues of its unstructured C-terminal tail around the folded VAMP7 longin domain, demonstrating that unstructured regions of clathrin adaptors can select cargo. Disrupting this interaction by mutation of the VAMP7 longin domain or depletion of Hrb causes VAMP7 to accumulate on the cell's surface. However, the SNARE helix of VAMP7 binds back onto its longin domain, outcompeting Hrb for binding to the same groove and suggesting that Hrb-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7 occurs only when VAMP7 is incorporated into a cis-SNARE complex. These results elucidate the mechanism of retrieval of a postfusion SNARE complex in clathrin-coated vesicles."
19509058,1,Cell,413066,2008,UBXD7 binds multiple ubiquitin ligases and implicates p97 in HIF1alpha turnover.,"p97 is an ATP-dependent chaperone that plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation but whose connections to turnover of soluble proteins remain sparse. Binding of p97 to substrates is mediated by cofactors that contain ubiquitin-binding domains. We employed &quot;network proteomics&quot; to show that p97 assembles with all of the 13 mammalian UBX-domain proteins. The UBX proteins that bind ubiquitin conjugates also interact with dozens of E3 ubiquitin ligases, only one of which had been previously linked to p97. In particular, UBXD7 links p97 to the ubiquitin ligase CUL2/VHL and its substrate hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). Depletion of p97 leads to accumulation of endogenous HIF1alpha and increased expression of a HIF1alpha target gene. The large number of ubiquitin ligases found associated with UBX proteins suggests that p97 plays a far broader role than previously anticipated in the global regulation of protein turnover."
19509062,1,Hum. Mol. Genet.,9208958,2008,CEP290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component PCM-1 and is required for Rab8 localization to the primary cilium.,"Joubert syndrome (JS) is a developmental brain disorder characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, abnormal eye movement, ataxia and mental retardation. Mutations in CEP290 mutations are responsible for the cerebello-oculo-renal subtype of JS that includes kidney cysts and retinal degeneration, two phenotypes commonly linked to ciliopathies. CEP290 mutations are also associated with Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Here we demonstrate that CEP290 interacts with a centriolar satellite protein PCM-1, which is implicated in BBS4 function. CEP290 binds to PCM-1 and localizes to centriolar satellites in a PCM-1- and microtubule-dependent manner. The depletion of CEP290 disrupts subcellular distribution and protein complex formation of PCM-1. In accord with PCM-1's role in microtubule organization, CEP290 knockdown causes the disorganization of the cytoplasmic microtubule network. Moreover, we show that both CEP290 and PCM-1 are required for ciliogenesis and are involved in the ciliary targeting of Rab8, a small GTPase shown to collaborate with BBS protein complex to promote ciliogenesis. Our results suggest that PCM-1 is a potential mediator that may link CEP290 with BBS proteins in common molecular pathways."

Biochem.,9113221,2008,The RCC1 domain of protein associated with Myc (PAM) interacts with and regulates KCC2.,"GABAergic and glycinergic function is dependent on neuronal intracellular chloride. The neuron-specific electroneutral potassium (K(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) cotransporter (KCC2), is a key regulator of neuronal Cl(-), yet little is known about KCC2 regulation. Using yeast two-hybrid, we identified Protein Associated with Myc (PAM) as a binding partner of KCC2. The RCC1 (Regulator of Chromatin Condensation) domain of PAM binds to the carboxyl terminus of KCC2, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull-down assays. RCC1/PAM and full-length KCC2 coimmunoprecipitate following heterologous co-expression in HEK293 cells. Additionally, (86)Rb/K(+) uptake assays in this model system show that RCC1/PAM causes increased KCC2-mediated flux. After narrowing down RCC1/PAM binding to a 20 amino acid region on the KCC2 carboxyl terminus, we created a point mutant in this region to eliminate interaction between the KCC2 carboxyl terminus and RCC1/PAM. This same mutation abolishes N-ethylmaleimide activation of KCC2, suggesting that PAM plays a role in modulating KCC2 function."
19509292,0,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2008,Separase cooperates with Zds1 and Zds2 to activate Cdc14 phosphatase in early anaphase.,"Completion of mitotic exit and cytokinesis requires the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. A key enzyme that counteracts Cdk during budding yeast mitotic exit is the Cdc14 phosphatase. Cdc14 is inactive for much of the cell cycle, sequestered by its inhibitor Net1 in the nucleolus. At anaphase onset, separase-dependent down-regulation of PP2A(Cdc55) allows phosphorylation of Net1 and consequent Cdc14 release. How separase causes PP2A(Cdc55) down-regulation is not known. Here, we show that two Cdc55-interacting proteins, Zds1 and Zds2, contribute to timely Cdc14 activation during mitotic exit. Zds1 and Zds2 are required downstream of separase to facilitate nucleolar Cdc14 release. Ectopic Zds1 expression in turn is sufficient to down-regulate PP2A(Cdc55) and promote Net1 phosphorylation. These findings identify Zds1 and Zds2 as new components of the mitotic exit machinery, involved in activation of the Cdc14 phosphatase at anaphase onset. Our results suggest that these proteins may act as separase-regulated PP2A(Cdc55) inhibitors."
19509313,0,Cell,413066,2008,The GET complex mediates insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane.,"Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, defined by the presence of a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), play critical roles throughout the secretory pathway and in mitochondria, yet the machinery responsible for their proper membrane insertion remains poorly characterized. Here we show that Get3, the yeast homolog of the TA-interacting factor Asna1/Trc40, specifically recognizes TMDs of TA proteins destined for the secretory pathway. Get3 recognition represents a key decision step, whose loss can lead to misinsertion of TA proteins into mitochondria. Get3-TA protein complexes are recruited for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane insertion by the Get1/Get2 receptor. In vivo, the absence of Get1/Get2 leads to cytosolic aggregation of Get3-TA complexes and broad defects in TA protein biogenesis. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that the Get proteins directly mediate insertion of newly synthesized TA proteins into ER membranes. Thus, the GET complex represents a critical mechanism for ensuring efficient and accurate targeting of TA proteins."
19509335,0,Cell,413066,2008,The mRNA export factor Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate regulate distinct stages of translation.,"Gene expression requires proper messenger RNA (mRNA) export and translation. However, the functional links between these consecutive steps have not been fully defined. Gle1 is an essential, conserved mRNA export factor whose export function is dependent on the small molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)). Here, we show that both Gle1 and IP(6) are required for efficient translation termination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that Gle1 interacts with termination factors. In addition, Gle1 has a conserved physical association with the initiation factor eIF3, and gle1 mutants display genetic interactions with the eIF3 mutant nip1-1. Strikingly, gle1 mutants have defects in initiation, whereas strains lacking IP(6) do not. We propose that Gle1 functions together with IP(6) and the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 to regulate termination. However, Gle1 also independently mediates initiation. Thus, Gle1 is uniquely positioned to coordinate the mRNA export and translation mechanisms. These results directly impact models for perturbation of Gle1 function in pathophysiology."
19509336,0,Science,404511,2008,High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network.,"Current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular complexes with limited and somewhat controversial representation of direct binary interactions. We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a &quot;second-generation&quot; high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering approximately 20% of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy."
19509340,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,The NDR/LATS family kinase Cbk1 directly controls transcriptional asymmetry.,"Cell fate can be determined by asymmetric segregation of gene expression regulators. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factor Ace2 accumulates specifically in the daughter cell nucleus, where it drives transcription of genes that are not expressed in the mother cell. The NDR/LATS family protein kinase Cbk1 is required for Ace2 segregation and function. Using peptide scanning arrays, we determined Cbk1's phosphorylation consensus motif, the first such unbiased approach for an enzyme of this family, showing that it is a basophilic kinase with an unusual preference for histidine -5 to the phosphorylation site. We found that Cbk1 phosphorylates such sites in Ace2, and that these modifications are critical for Ace2's partitioning and function. Using proteins marked with GFP variants, we found that Ace2 moves from isotropic distribution to the daughter cell nuclear localization, well before cytokinesis, and that the nucleus must enter the daughter cell for Ace2 accumulation to occur. We found that Cbk1, unlike Ace2, is restricted to the daughter cell. Using both in vivo and in vitro assays, we found that two critical Cbk1 phosphorylations block Ace2's interaction with nuclear export machinery, while a third distal modification most likely acts to increase the transcription factor's activity. Our findings show that Cbk1 directly controls Ace2, regulating the transcription factor's activity and interaction with nuclear export machinery through three phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, Cbk1 exhibits a novel specificity that is likely conserved among related kinases from yeast to metazoans. Cbk1 is functionally restricted to the daughter cell, and cannot diffuse from the daughter to the mother. In addition to providing a mechanism for Ace2 segregation, these findings show that an isotropically distributed cell fate determinant can be asymmetrically partitioned in cytoplasmically contiguous cells through spatial segregation of a regulating protein kinase."
19509419,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,The MADS domain protein DIANA acts together with AGAMOUS-LIKE80 to specify the central cell in Arabidopsis ovules.,"MADS box genes in plants consist of MIKC-type and type I genes. While MIKC-type genes have been studied extensively, the functions of type I genes are still poorly understood. Evidence suggests that type I MADS box genes are involved in embryo sac and seed development. We investigated two independent T-DNA insertion alleles of the Arabidopsis thaliana type I MADS box gene AGAMOUS-LIKE61 (AGL61) and showed that in agl61 mutant ovules, the polar nuclei do not fuse and central cell morphology is aberrant. Furthermore, the central cell begins to degenerate before fertilization takes place. Although pollen tubes are attracted and perceived by the mutant ovules, neither endosperm development nor zygote formation occurs. AGL61 is expressed in the central cell during the final stages of embryo sac development. An AGL61:green fluorescent protein-beta-glucoronidase fusion protein localizes exclusively to the polar nuclei and the secondary nucleus of the central cell. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that AGL61 can form a heterodimer with AGL80 and that the nuclear localization of AGL61 is lost in the agl80 mutant. Thus, AGL61 and AGL80 appear to function together to differentiate the central cell in Arabidopsis. We renamed AGL61 DIANA, after the virginal Roman goddess of the hunt."
19509420,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Rtt101 and Mms1 in budding yeast form a CUL4(DDB1)-like ubiquitin ligase that promotes replication through damaged DNA.,"In budding yeast the cullin Rtt101 promotes replication fork progression through natural pause sites and areas of DNA damage, but its relevant subunits and molecular mechanism remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in budding yeast Mms1 and Mms22 are functional subunits of an Rtt101-based ubiquitin ligase that associates with the conjugating-enzyme Cdc34. Replication forks in mms1Delta, mms22Delta and rtt101Delta cells are sensitive to collisions with drug-induced DNA lesions, but not to transient pausing induced by nucleotide depletion. Interaction studies and sequence analysis have shown that Mms1 resembles human DDB1, suggesting that Rtt101(Mms1) is the budding yeast counterpart of the mammalian CUL4(DDB1) ubiquitin ligase family. Rtt101 interacts in an Mms1-dependent manner with the putative substrate-specific adaptors Mms22 and Crt10, the latter being a regulator of expression of ribonucleotide reductase. Taken together, our data suggest that the Rtt101(Mms1) ubiquitin ligase complex might be required to reorganize replication forks that encounter DNA lesions."

Bot.,9882906,2008,An isoform of Arabidopsis myosin XI interacts with small GTPases in its C-terminal tail region.,"Myosin XI, a class of myosins expressed in plants is believed to be responsible for cytoplasmic streaming and the translocation of organelles and vesicles. To gain further insight into the translocation of organelles and vesicles by myosin XI, an isoform of Arabidopsis myosin XI, MYA2, was chosen and its role in peroxisome targeting was examined. Using the yeast two-hybrid screening method, two small GTPases, AtRabD1 and AtRabC2a, were identified as factors that interact with the C-terminal tail region of MYA2. Both recombinant AtRabs tagged with His bound to the recombinant C-terminal tail region of MYA2 tagged with GST in a GTP-dependent manner. Furthermore, AtRabC2a was localized on peroxisomes, when its CFP-tagged form was expressed transiently in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis leaf tissue. It is suggested that MYA2 targets the peroxisome through an interaction with AtRabC2a."

Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate Notch ligands are more diverse than classical Drosophila Notch ligands, suggesting possible functional complexities. Here, we describe a developmental role in Notch signaling for OSM-11, which has been previously implicated in defecation and osmotic resistance in C. elegans. We find that complete loss of OSM-11 causes defects in vulval precursor cell (VPC) fate specification during vulval development consistent with decreased Notch signaling. OSM-11 is a secreted, diffusible protein that, like previously described C. elegans Delta, Serrate, and LAG-2 (DSL) ligands, can interact with the lineage defective-12 (LIN-12) Notch receptor extracellular domain. Additionally, OSM-11 and similar C. elegans proteins share a common motif with Notch ligands from other species in a sequence defined here as the Delta and OSM-11 (DOS) motif. osm-11 loss-of-function defects in vulval development are exacerbated by loss of other DOS-motif genes or by loss of the Notch ligand DSL-1, suggesting that DOS-motif and DSL proteins act together to activate Notch signaling in vivo. The mammalian DOS-motif protein Deltalike1 (DLK1) can substitute for OSM-11 in C. elegans development, suggesting that DOS-motif function is conserved across species. We hypothesize that C. elegans OSM-11 and homologous proteins act as coactivators for Notch receptors, allowing precise regulation of Notch receptor signaling in developmental programs in both vertebrates and invertebrates."
19513066,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Retinoblastoma and its binding partner MSI1 control imprinting in Arabidopsis.,"Parental genomic imprinting causes preferential expression of one of the two parental alleles. In mammals, differential sex-dependent deposition of silencing DNA methylation marks during gametogenesis initiates a new cycle of imprinting. Parental genomic imprinting has been detected in plants and relies on DNA methylation by the methyltransferase MET1. However, in contrast to mammals, plant imprints are created by differential removal of silencing marks during gametogenesis. In Arabidopsis, DNA demethylation is mediated by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) causing activation of imprinted genes at the end of female gametogenesis. On the basis of genetic interactions, we show that in addition to DME, the plant homologs of the human Retinoblastoma (Rb) and its binding partner RbAp48 are required for the activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This Rb-dependent activation is mediated by direct transcriptional repression of MET1 during female gametogenesis. We have thus identified a new mechanism required for imprinting establishment, outlining a new role for the Retinoblastoma pathway, which may be conserved in mammals."
19513068,0,Cell,413066,2008,A protein domain-based interactome network for C. elegans early embryogenesis.,"Many protein-protein interactions are mediated through independently folding modular domains. Proteome-wide efforts to model protein-protein interaction or &quot;interactome&quot; networks have largely ignored this modular organization of proteins. We developed an experimental strategy to efficiently identify interaction domains and generated a domain-based interactome network for proteins involved in C. elegans early-embryonic cell divisions. Minimal interacting regions were identified for over 200 proteins, providing important information on their domain organization. Furthermore, our approach increased the sensitivity of the two-hybrid system, resulting in a more complete interactome network. This interactome modeling strategy revealed insights into C. elegans centrosome function and is applicable to other biological processes in this and other organisms."
19513072,0,Cell,413066,2008,Phosphorylation of SNAP-23 by IkappaB kinase 2 regulates mast cell degranulation.,"Mast cells are known to play a pivotal role in allergic diseases. Cross-linking of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) leads to degranulation and allergic inflammation; however, the regulatory mechanisms of IgE-dependent exocytosis remain unknown. We show here that IkappaB kinase (IKK) 2 in mast cells plays critical roles in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in vivo, and IgE-mediated degranulation in vitro, in an NF-kB-independent manner. Upon FcvarepsilonRI stimulation, IKK2 phosphorylates SNAP-23, the target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE), and ectopic expression of a phospho-mimetic mutant of SNAP-23 partially rescued the impaired IgE-mediated degranulation in IKK2-deficient mast cells. These results suggest that IKK2 phosphorylation of SNAP-23 leads to degranulation and anaphylactic reactions. While this reaction is NF-kB-independent, we additionally show that IKK2 also regulates late-phase allergic reactions promoted by the release of proinflammatory cytokines in an NF-kB-dependent manner. The findings suggest that IKK2 is a central player in allergic reactions."
19513120,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structural basis for cargo regulation of COPII coat assembly.,"Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have solved the structure of an icosidodecahedral COPII coat involved in cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coassembled from purified cargo adaptor Sec23-24 and Sec13-31 lattice-forming complexes. The coat structure shows a tetrameric assembly of the Sec23-24 adaptor layer that is well positioned beneath the vertices and edges of the Sec13-31 lattice. Fitting the known crystal structures of the COPII proteins into the density map reveals a flexible hinge region stemming from interactions between WD40 beta-propeller domains present in Sec13 and Sec31 at the vertices. The structure shows that the hinge region can direct geometric cage expansion to accommodate a wide range of bulky cargo, including procollagen and chylomicrons, that is sensitive to adaptor function in inherited disease. The COPII coat structure leads us to propose a mechanism by which cargo drives cage assembly and membrane curvature for budding from the ER."

Recently, we showed that IL-33 is a chromatin-associated factor in the nucleus of endothelial cells in vivo. Here, we report the identification of a short IL-33 chromatin-binding peptide that shares striking similarities with a motif found in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen), which is responsible for the attachment of viral genomes to mitotic chromosomes. Similar to LANA, the IL-33 peptide docks into the acidic pocket formed by the H2A-H2B dimer at the nucleosomal surface and regulates chromatin compaction by promoting nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Taken together, our data provide important new insights into the nuclear roles of IL-33, and show a unique example of molecular mimicry of a chromatin-associated cytokine by a DNA tumour virus. In addition, the data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of the existence of non-histone cellular factors that bind to the acidic pocket of the nucleosome."
19513348,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Conserved motifs in both CPSF73 and CPSF100 are required to assemble the active endonuclease for histone mRNA 3'-end maturation.,"In eukaryotes, the process of messenger RNA 3'-end formation involves endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript followed by synthesis of the poly(A) tail. The complex machinery involved in this maturation process contains two proteins of the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) superfamily, the 73 and 100 kDa subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). By using an in vitro system to assess point mutations in these two mammalian proteins, we found that conserved residues from the MBL motifs of both polypeptides are required for assembly of the endonuclease activity that cleaves histone pre-mRNAs. This indicates that CPSF73 and CPSF100 act together in the process of maturation of eukaryotic pre-messenger RNAs, similar to other members of the MBL family, RNases Z and J, which function as homodimers."
19515238,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Control of DNA polymerase lambda stability by phosphorylation and ubiquitination during the cell cycle.,"DNA polymerase (Pol) lambda is a DNA repair enzyme involved in base excision repair, non-homologous end joining and translesion synthesis. Recently, we identified Pol lambda as an interaction partner of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) that is central to the cell cycle G1/S transition and S-phase progression. This interaction leads to in vitro phosphorylation of Pol lambda, and its in vivo phosphorylation pattern during cell cycle progression mimics the modulation of CDK2/cyclin A. Here, we identify several phosphorylation sites of Pol lambda. Experiments with phosphorylation-defective mutants suggest that phosphorylation of Thr 553 is important for maintaining Pol lambda stability, as it is targeted to the proteasomal degradation pathway through ubiquitination unless this residue is phosphorylated. In particular, Pol lambda is stabilized during cell cycle progression in the late S and G2 phases. This most likely allows Pol lambda to correctly conduct repair of damaged DNA during and after S phase."

Neither the mechanism nor functional significance of checkpoint regulation of the cell-cycle transcription program are established. We show that Nrm1, an MBF-specific transcriptional repressor acting at the transition from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle, is at the nexus between the cell cycle transcriptional program and the DNA replication checkpoint in fission yeast. Phosphorylation of Nrm1 by the Cds1 (Chk2) checkpoint protein kinase, which is activated in response to DNA replication stress, promotes its dissociation from the MBF transcription factor. This leads to the expression of genes encoding components that function in DNA replication and repair pathways important for cell survival in response to arrested DNA replication."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Herpesvirus tegument protein activates NF-kappaB signaling through the TRAF6 adaptor protein.,"Viruses remodel the host cell to optimize their replication both by delivery of virion proteins into the cell and by de novo expression of viral proteins. The HSV particle contains several proteins that function to prepare the host cell for viral replication, including the VP16 transcriptional activator protein and virion host shutoff protein. HSV infection activates NF-kappaB pathways through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and non-TLR pathways, and NF-kappaB activity is required for efficient viral replication. In a screen of the HSV proteome, we observed that the HSV U(L)37 tegument protein activates NF-kappaB signaling in a TLR2-independent manner. Expression of U(L)37 in transfected cells leads to IkappaB degradation and activation of both reporter genes and the endogenous IL-8 gene. This activation requires TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and U(L)37 contains a TRAF6-binding domain that is required for interaction with TRAF6 and activation of NF-kappaB. A mutant virus encoding U(L)37 with an altered TRAF6-binding site shows reduced NF-kappaB activation in the early phase of infection. Therefore, the HSV U(L)37 virion structural protein can activate NF-kappaB through TRAF6. Activation of NF-kappaB by a virion tegument protein that is delivered into the host cell cytoplasm during viral entry represents a mechanism for activation of this pathway by a virus."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Retinoic acid-stimulated sequential phosphorylation, PML recruitment, and SUMOylation of nuclear receptor TR2 to suppress Oct4 expression.","We previously reported an intricate mechanism underlying the homeostasis of Oct4 expression in normally proliferating stem cell culture of P19, mediated by SUMOylation of orphan nuclear receptor TR2. In the present study, we identify a signaling pathway initiated from the nongenomic activity of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) to stimulate complex formation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) with its upstream kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). The activated ERK2 phosphorylates threonine-210 (Thr-210) of TR2, stimulating its subsequent SUMOylation. Dephosphorylated TR2 recruits coactivator PCAF and functions as an activator for its target gene Oct4. Upon phosphorylation at Thr-210, TR2 increasingly associates with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, becomes SUMOylated, and recruits corepressor RIP140 to act as a repressor for its target, Oct4. To normally proliferating P19 stem cell culture, exposure to a physiological concentration of atRA triggers a rapid nongenomic signaling cascade to suppress Oct4 gene and regulate cell proliferation."
19515818,0,Structure,101087697,2008,The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RNase E apoprotein and a mechanism for RNA degradation.,"RNase E is an essential bacterial endoribonuclease involved in the turnover of messenger RNA and the maturation of structured RNA precursors in Escherichia coli. Here, we present the crystal structure of the E. coli RNase E catalytic domain in the apo-state at 3.3 A. This structure indicates that, upon catalytic activation, RNase E undergoes a marked conformational change characterized by the coupled movement of two RNA-binding domains to organize the active site. The structural data suggest a mechanism of RNA recognition and cleavage that explains the enzyme's preference for substrates possessing a 5'-monophosphate and accounts for the protective effect of a triphosphate cap for most transcripts. Internal flexibility within the quaternary structure is also observed, a finding that has implications for recognition of structured RNA substrates and for the mechanism of internal entry for a subset of substrates that are cleaved without 5'-end requirements."

The human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase subunit UL44 forms a C clamp-shaped dimer intermediate in structure between monomeric herpes simplex virus UL42, which binds DNA directly via a basic surface, and the trimeric sliding clamp PCNA, which encircles DNA. To investigate how UL44 interacts with DNA, calculations were performed in which a 12 bp DNA oligonucleotide was docked to UL44. The calculations suggested that UL44 encircles DNA, which interacts with basic residues both within the cavity of the C clamp and in flexible loops of UL44 that complete the &quot;circle.&quot; The results of mutational and crosslinking studies were consistent with this model. Thus, UL44 is a &quot;hybrid&quot; of UL42 and PCNA: its structure is intermediate between the two and its mode of interaction with DNA has elements of both."
19515834,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Dynamic properties of a type II cadherin adhesive domain: implications for the mechanism of strand-swapping of classical cadherins.,"Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is achieved through dimerization of cadherin N-terminal extracellular (EC1) domains presented from apposed cells. The dimer state is formed by exchange of N-terminal beta strands and insertion of conserved tryptophan indole side chains from one monomer into hydrophobic acceptor pockets of the partner molecule. The present work characterizes individual monomer and dimer states and the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the mouse Type II cadherin-8 EC1 domain using NMR spectroscopy. Limited picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale dynamics of the tryptophan indole moieties for both monomer and dimer states are consistent with well-ordered packing of the N-terminal beta strands intramolecularly and intermolecularly, respectively. However, pronounced microsecond-to-millisecond timescale dynamics of the side chains are observed for the monomer but not the dimer state, suggesting that monomers transiently sample configurations in which the indole moieties are exposed. The results suggest possible kinetic mechanisms for EC1 dimerization."
19515915,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Ion permeation through a Cl--selective channel designed from a CLC Cl-/H+ exchanger.,"The CLC family of Cl(-)-transporting proteins includes both Cl(-) channels and Cl(-)/H(+) exchange transporters. CLC-ec1, a structurally known bacterial homolog of the transporter subclass, exchanges two Cl(-) ions per proton with strict, obligatory stoichiometry. Point mutations at two residues, Glu(148) and Tyr(445), are known to impair H(+) movement while preserving Cl(-) transport. In the x-ray crystal structure of CLC-ec1, these residues form putative &quot;gates&quot; flanking an ion-binding region. In mutants with both of the gate-forming side chains reduced in size, H(+) transport is abolished, and unitary Cl(-) transport rates are greatly increased, well above values expected for transporter mechanisms. Cl(-) transport rates increase as side-chain volume at these positions is decreased. The crystal structure of a doubly ungated mutant shows a narrow conduit traversing the entire protein transmembrane width. These characteristics suggest that Cl(-) flux through uncoupled, ungated CLC-ec1 occurs via a channel-like electrodiffusion mechanism rather than an alternating-exposure conformational cycle that has been rendered proton-independent by the gate mutations."

This capability has led to its widespread use in artificial genetic transformation. In addition to DNA, the bacterium delivers an abundant ssDNA binding protein, VirE2, whose roles in the host include protection from cytoplasmic nucleases and adaptation for nuclear import. In Agrobacterium, VirE2 is bound to its acidic chaperone VirE1. When expressed in vitro in the absence of VirE1, VirE2 is prone to oligomerization and forms disordered filamentous aggregates. These filaments adopt an ordered solenoidal form in the presence of ssDNA, which was characterized previously by electron microscopy and three-dimensional image processing. VirE2 coexpressed in vitro with VirE1 forms a soluble heterodimer. VirE1 thus prevents VirE2 oligomerization and competes with its binding to ssDNA. We present here a crystal structure of VirE2 in complex with VirE1, showing that VirE2 is composed of two independent domains presenting a novel fold, joined by a flexible linker. Electrostatic interactions with VirE1 cement the two domains of VirE2 into a locked form. Comparison with the electron microscopy structure indicates that the VirE2 domains adopt different relative orientations. We suggest that the flexible linker between the domains enables VirE2 to accommodate its different binding partners."

However, it remains to be determined exactly how NBS1 accumulates at or near DNA double-strand breaks. Here we report that MDC1 directly binds to NBS1 and targets NBS1 to the sites of DNA damage. The MDC1-NBS1 interaction occurs through a specific region (residues 200-420) of MDC1, which contains multiple consensus casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation sites. In addition, this interaction requires both the forkhead-associated (FHA) and tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains of NBS1. Disruption of the MDC1-NBS1 interaction results in failure of NBS1 accumulation at DNA double-strand breaks and impairment of intra-S checkpoint activation. These studies provide important mechanistic insights as to how MDC1 regulates NBS1 and the intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The intracellular region of Notch ligands Dll1 and Dll3 regulates their trafficking and signaling activity.,"Genetic studies have shown that ubiquitination and endocytosis of the Drosophila ligand Delta in signal-sending cells are required for activation of Notch signaling, but how these events promote Notch activation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that an ubiquitination-defective mutant of the murine Delta-homologue Dll1 is endocytosed but, in contrast to the wild-type Dll1, is unable to subsequently recycle back to the cell surface or to bind Notch1 efficiently. These results demonstrate that ubiquitination, although not required for endocytosis, is essential for Dll1 recycling and that recycling is required to acquire affinity for the receptor. On the other hand, a chimeric molecule encompassing the extracellular domain of Dll1 and the transmembrane/intracellular domain of Dll3, which contains no lysine, is endocytosed, recycled, and interacts with Notch1 but is unable to induce transendocytosis of the extracellular region of Notch1 or to signal. These observations suggest that the chimera uses an ubiquitination-independent signal to recycle, allowing it to acquire affinity for Notch1. Our results support the idea that ligand recycling determines its competence to bind efficiently to the receptor but that this is insufficient to allow it to perform transendocytosis, an event required for activation of Notch signaling. Finally, the present study indicates that Dll1 partially localizes to lipid microdomains, whereas both ubiquitination-defective Dll1 and the Dll1-3 chimera are excluded from these compartments, suggesting that these microdomains provide the environment necessary for Dll1 to activate Notch signaling."

Although certain natural compounds, such as reseveratrol, have endurance-enhancing activities, their exact metabolic targets remain elusive. We therefore tested the effect of pathway-specific drugs on endurance capacities of mice in a treadmill running test. We found that PPARbeta/delta agonist and exercise training synergistically increase oxidative myofibers and running endurance in adult mice. Because training activates AMPK and PGC1alpha, we then tested whether the orally active AMPK agonist AICAR might be sufficient to overcome the exercise requirement. Unexpectedly, even in sedentary mice, 4 weeks of AICAR treatment alone induced metabolic genes and enhanced running endurance by 44%. These results demonstrate that AMPK-PPARdelta pathway can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training adaptation or even to increase endurance without exercise."

G-protein coupled receptors comprise the largest protein superfamily in metazoa and are physiologically important as they sense highly diverse stimuli and play key roles in human disease. The heterotrimeric G-protein signaling mechanism is conserved across metazoa, and also readily identifiable in plants, but the low sequence conservation of G-protein coupled receptors hampers the identification of novel ones. Using diverse computational methods, we performed whole-proteome analyses of the three dominant model plant species, the herbaceous dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-eared cress), the monocot Oryza sativa (rice), and the woody dicot Populus trichocarpa (poplar), to identify plant protein sequences most likely to be GPCRs. RESULTS: Our stringent bioinformatic pipeline allowed the high confidence identification of candidate G-protein coupled receptors within the Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Populus proteomes. We extended these computational results through actual wet-bench experiments where we tested over half of our highest ranking Arabidopsis candidate G-protein coupled receptors for the ability to physically couple with GPA1, the sole G alpha in Arabidopsis. We found that seven out of eight tested candidate G-protein coupled receptors do in fact interact with GPA1. We show through G-protein coupled receptor classification and molecular evolutionary analyses that both individual G-protein coupled receptor candidates and candidate G-protein coupled receptor families are conserved across plant species and that, in some cases, this conservation extends to metazoans. CONCLUSION: Our computational and wet-bench results provide the first step toward understanding the diversity, conservation, and functional roles of plant candidate G-protein coupled receptors."

This study examines the role of the protein kinase Doubletime (DBT), a Drosophila ortholog of human casein kinase I (CKI)epsilon/delta. An enzymatically active DBT protein is shown to directly phosphorylate the Drosophila clock protein Period (PER). DBT-dependent phosphorylation sites are identified within PER, and their functional significance is assessed in a cultured cell system and in vivo. The per(S) mutation, which is associated with short-period (19-h) circadian rhythms, alters a key phosphorylation target within PER. Inspection of this and neighboring sequence variants indicates that several DBT-directed phosphorylations regulate PER activity in an integrated fashion: Alternative phosphorylations of two adjoining sequence motifs appear to be associated with switch-like changes in PER stability and repressor function."
19516266,0,Cell,413066,2008,The Cdc14B-Cdh1-Plk1 axis controls the G2 DNA-damage-response checkpoint.,"In response to DNA damage in G2, mammalian cells must avoid entry into mitosis and instead initiate DNA repair. Here, we show that, in response to genotoxic stress in G2, the phosphatase Cdc14B translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and induces the activation of the ubiquitin ligase APC/C(Cdh1), with the consequent degradation of Plk1, a prominent mitotic kinase. This process induces the stabilization of Claspin, an activator of the DNA-damage checkpoint, and Wee1, an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression, and allows an efficient G2 checkpoint. As a by-product of APC/C(Cdh1) reactivation in DNA-damaged G2 cells, Claspin, which we show to be an APC/C(Cdh1) substrate in G1, is targeted for degradation. However, this process is counteracted by the deubiquitylating enzyme Usp28 to permit Claspin-mediated activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage. These findings define a novel pathway that is crucial for the G2 DNA-damage-response checkpoint."

Previously, we reported that TGF-beta1 stimulation induces the degradation of p57(KIP2) in osteoblasts. p57(KIP2) proteolysis depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and SMAD-mediated transcription; however, the molecular mechanism underlying p57(KIP2) degradation has been largely unknown. Here, we show that FBL12, a new F-box protein expressed in the limb bud of developing embryos, is involved in TGF-beta1-induced degradation of p57(KIP2). FBL12 formed an SCF(FBL12) complex and directly ubiquitinated p57(KIP2) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Inhibition of FBL12 by RNA interference suppressed the degradation of p57(KIP2) and a dominant-negative mutant of FBL12 (FBL12DeltaF) increased the steady-state level of p57(KIP2). Furthermore, wild-type FBL12 inhibited and FBL12DeltaF promoted the differentiation of primary osteoblasts. As overexpression of p57(KIP2) promoted osteoblast differentiation, these results indicate the importance of FBL12 and the degradation of p57(KIP2) in the regulation of osteoblast cell differentiation."

Here, we show that MCPH1 regulates CHK1 and BRCA1 through the interaction with E2F1 on the promoters of both genes. MCPH1 also regulates other E2F target genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis such as RAD51, DDB2, TOPBP1, p73 and caspases. MCPH1 interacts with E2F1 on the p73 promoter, and regulates p73 induction and E2F1-induced apoptosis as a result of DNA damage. MCPH1 forms oligomers through the second and third BRCT domains. An MCPH1 mutant containing only its oligomerization domain has a dominant-negative role by blocking MCPH1 binding to E2F1. It also inhibits p73 induction in DNA damage and E2F1-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, MCPH1 cooperates with E2F1 to regulate genes involved in DNA repair, checkpoint and apoptosis, and might participate in the maintenance of genomic integrity."
19516898,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,PCSK9 is required for the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of the nascent membrane protein BACE1.,"We have recently identified a new form of post-translational regulation of BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1), a membrane protein that acts as the rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of the Alzheimer disease amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Specifically, BACE1 is transiently acetylated on seven lysine residues in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ER/ERGIC). The acetylated intermediates of the nascent protein are able to reach the Golgi apparatus, whereas the non-acetylated ones are retained and degraded in a post-ER compartment. Here, we report that the serine protease PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) contributes to the disposal of non-acetylated BACE1. Both overexpression and small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of PCSK9 affected the levels of BACE1. The downregulation of PCSK9 affected the levels of the loss-of-acetylation mutants (BACE1(Ala) and BACE1(Arg)) but not those of the gain-of-acetylation mutant (BACE1(Gln)). In addition, Pcsk9(-/-) mice showed increased levels of BACE1 and Abeta in the brain. Finally, we found that nascent low-density lipoprotein receptor, a known substrate of PCSK9, is also acetylated."
19517011,0,Science,404511,2008,BSKs mediate signal transduction from the receptor kinase BRI1 in Arabidopsis.,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor kinase BRI1 to activate a signal transduction cascade that regulates nuclear gene expression and plant development. Many components of the BR signaling pathway have been identified and studied in detail. However, the substrate of BRI1 kinase that transduces the signal to downstream components remains unknown. Proteomic studies of plasma membrane proteins lead to the identification of three homologous BR-signaling kinases (BSK1, BSK2, and BSK3). The BSKs are phosphorylated by BRI1 in vitro and interact with BRI1 in vivo. Genetic and transgenic studies demonstrate that the BSKs represent a small family of kinases that activate BR signaling downstream of BRI1. These results demonstrate that BSKs are the substrates of BRI1 kinase that activate downstream BR signal transduction."

We demonstrate that this neurotoxicity reflects activation of COX-2 by S-nitrosylation after selective binding of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to COX-2. nNOS, via its PDZ domain, binds COX-2 with the generated NO S-nitrosylating and activating the enzyme. Selective disruption of nNOS-COX-2 binding prevents NMDA neurotoxicity."

Biochemical data presented here suggest that Tctex-1, a light chain of the molecular motor dynein, is involved in the intracellular targeting of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) polyproteins to the cytoplasmic assembly site. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of M-PMV wild-type matrix protein (wt MA) with a single amino acid mutant (R55F), which redirects assembly from a cytoplasmic site to the plasma membrane, revealed different mutual orientations of their C- and N-terminal domains. This conformational change buries a putative intracellular targeting motif located between both domains in the hydrophobic pocket of the MA molecule, thereby preventing the interaction with cellular transport mechanisms."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Crystal structure of the cell wall anchor domain of MotB, a stator component of the bacterial flagellar motor: implications for peptidoglycan recognition.","The stator ring of the bacterial flagellar motor is composed of the MotA and MotB proteins that act together to generate a turning force (torque) acting on the FliG ring of the rotor. The C-terminal domain of MotB (MotB-C) is believed to anchor the MotA/MotB complex to peptidoglycan (PG) of the cell wall. The first crystal structures of MotB-C and its complex with N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) have been determined to 1.6- and 2.3-A resolution, respectively. MotB-C is a dimer, both in solution and in the crystal. The two glycan chains of the PG ligand can be modeled as semirigid helices and docked into the grooves harboring the NAM molecules on the opposite faces of the dimer. The model suggests that a concave hydrophilic surface created upon edge-to-edge beta-sheet dimerization and centered around the 2-fold axis of the dimer can accommodate the peptide cross-bridge linking the two sugar chains. Significant structural similarities were found between MotB-C and the PG-binding domains of reduction-modifiable protein M and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein exclude, suggesting that PG recognition by different outer membrane protein A-like proteins may be governed by very similar molecular mechanisms that evidently involve protein dimerization."
19518131,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,The three mitochondrial encoded CcmF proteins form a complex that interacts with CCMH and c-type apocytochromes in Arabidopsis.,"Three reading frames called ccmF(N1), ccmF(N2), and ccmF(c) are found in the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis. These sequences are similar to regions of the bacterial gene ccmF involved in cytochrome c maturation. ccmF genes are always absent from animal and fungi genomes but are found in mitochondrial genomes of land plant and several evolutionary distant eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, ccmF(N2) despite the absence of a classical initiation codon is not a pseudo gene. The 3 ccmF genes of Arabidopsis are expressed at the protein level. Their products are integral proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane with in total 11 to 13 predicted transmembrane helices. The conserved WWD domain of CcmF(N2) is localized in the inter membrane space. The 3 CcmF proteins are all detected in a high molecular mass complex of 500 kDa by Blue Native PAGE. Direct interaction between CcmF(N2) and both CcmF(N1) and CcmF(C) is shown with the yeast two-hybrid split ubiquitin system, but no interaction is observed between CcmF(N1) and CcmF(C). Similarly, interaction is detected between CcmF(N2) and apocytochrome c but also with apocytochrome c(1). Finally, CcmF(N1) and CcmF(N2) both interact with CCMH previously shown to interact as well with cytochrome c. This strengthens the hypothesis that CcmF and CCMH make a complex that performs the assembly of heme with c-type apocytochromes in plant mitochondria."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Endothelial nitric oxide synthase regulates N-Ras activation on the Golgi complex of antigen-stimulated T cells.,"Ras/ERK signaling plays an important role in T cell activation and development. We recently reported that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-derived NO regulates T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent ERK activation by a cGMP-independent mechanism. Here, we explore the mechanisms through which eNOS exerts this regulation. We have found that eNOS-derived NO positively regulates Ras/ERK activation in T cells stimulated with antigen on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Intracellular activation of N-, H-, and K-Ras was monitored with fluorescent probes in T cells stably transfected with eNOS-GFP or its G2A point mutant, which is defective in activity and cellular localization. Using this system, we demonstrate that eNOS selectively activates N-Ras but not K-Ras on the Golgi complex of T cells engaged with APC, even though Ras isoforms are activated in response to NO from donors. We further show that activation of N-Ras involves eNOS-dependent S-nitrosylation on Cys(118), suggesting that upon TCR engagement, eNOS-derived NO directly activates N-Ras on the Golgi. Moreover, wild-type but not C118S N-Ras increased TCR-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that S-nitrosylation of Cys(118) contributes to activation-induced T cell death. Our data define a signaling mechanism for the regulation of the Ras/ERK pathway based on the eNOS-dependent differential activation of N-Ras and K-Ras at specific cell compartments."

The high-resolution crystal structure of the complex formed by the complete ectodomains of murine PD-1 and PD-L2 revealed a 1:1 receptor:ligand stoichiometry and displayed a binding interface and overall molecular organization distinct from that observed in the CTLA-4/B7 inhibitory complexes. Furthermore, our structure also provides insights into the association between PD-1 and PD-L1 and highlights differences in the interfaces formed by the two PD-1 ligands (PD-Ls) Mutagenesis studies confirmed the details of the proposed PD-1/PD-L binding interfaces and allowed for the design of a mutant PD-1 receptor with enhanced affinity. These studies define spatial and organizational constraints that control the localization and signaling of PD-1/PD-L complexes within the immunological synapse and provide a basis for manipulating the PD-1 pathways for immunotherapy."

We identified a new CV regulator, Disgorgin, a TBC-domain-containing protein, which translocates to the CV membrane at the late stage of CV charging and regulates CV-plasma membrane fusion and discharging. disgorgin(-) cells produce large CVs due to impaired CV-plasma membrane fusion. Disgorgin is a specific GAP for Rab8A-GTP, which also localizes to the CV and whose hydrolysis is required for discharging. We demonstrate that Drainin, a previously identified TBC-domain-containing protein, lies upstream from Disgorgin in this pathway. Unlike Disgorgin, Drainin lacks GAP activity but functions as a Rab11A effector. The BEACH family proteins LvsA and LvsD were identified in a suppressor/enhancer screen of the disgorgin(-) large CV phenotype and demonstrated to have distinct functions in regulating CV formation. Our studies help define the pathways controlling CV function."
19520058,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Viral targeting of DEAD box protein 3 reveals its role in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation.,"Viruses are detected by different classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-like helicases. Engagement of PRRs leads to activation of interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 through IKKepsilon and TBK1 and consequently IFN-beta induction. Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes proteins that manipulate host signalling, sometimes by targeting uncharacterised proteins. Here, we describe a novel VACV protein, K7, which can inhibit PRR-induced IFN-beta induction by preventing TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation. We identified DEAD box protein 3 (DDX3) as a host target of K7. Expression of DDX3 enhanced Ifnb promoter induction by TBK1/IKKepsilon, whereas knockdown of DDX3 inhibited this, and virus- or dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation. Further, dominant-negative DDX3 inhibited virus-, dsRNA- and cytosolic DNA-stimulated Ccl5 promoter induction, which is also TBK1/IKKepsilon dependent. Both K7 binding and enhancement of Ifnb induction mapped to the N-terminus of DDX3. Furthermore, virus infection induced an association between DDX3 and IKKepsilon. Therefore, this study shows for the first time the involvement of a DEAD box helicase in TBK1/IKKepsilon-mediated IRF activation and Ifnb promoter induction."
19520432,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,The tumour suppressor CYLD is a negative regulator of RIG-I-mediated antiviral response.,"On detecting viral RNAs, the RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) activates the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling pathway to induce type I interferon (IFN) gene transcription. How this antiviral signalling pathway might be negatively regulated is poorly understood. Microarray and bioinformatic analysis indicated that the expression of RIG-I and that of the tumour suppressor CYLD (cylindromatosis), a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains, are closely correlated, suggesting a functional association between the two molecules. Ectopic expression of CYLD inhibits the IRF3 signalling pathway and IFN production triggered by RIG-I; conversely, CYLD knockdown enhances the response. CYLD removes polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I as well as from TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), the kinase that phosphorylates IRF3, coincident with an inhibition of the IRF3 signalling pathway. Furthermore, CYLD protein level is reduced in the presence of tumour necrosis factor and viral infection, concomitant with enhanced IFN production. These findings show that CYLD is a negative regulator of RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral response."

Here we report that DAWDLE (DDL), an FHA domain-containing protein in Arabidopsis, acts in the biogenesis of miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs. Unlike mutants of genes known to participate in the processing of miRNA precursors, such as dcl1, hyponastic leaves1, and serrate, ddl mutants show reduced levels of pri-miRNAs as well as mature miRNAs. Promoter activity of MIR genes, however, is not affected by ddl mutations. DDL is an RNA binding protein and is able to interact with DCL1. In addition, we found that SNIP1, the human homolog of DDL, is involved in miRNA biogenesis and interacts with Drosha. Therefore, we uncovered an evolutionarily conserved factor in miRNA biogenesis. We propose that DDL participates in miRNA biogenesis by facilitating DCL1 to access or recognize pri-miRNAs."
19520842,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Glucose controls CREB activity in islet cells via regulated phosphorylation of TORC2.,"CREB is a cAMP- and calcium-responsive transcriptional activator that is required for islet beta cell proliferation and survival. Glucose and incretin hormones elicit beta cell insulin secretion and promote synergistic CREB activity by inducing the nuclear relocalization of TORC2 (also known as Crtc2), a coactivator for CREB. In islet cells under basal conditions when CREB activity is low, TORC2 is phosphorylated and sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins. In response to feeding stimuli, TORC2 is dephosphorylated, enters the nucleus, and binds to CREB located at target gene promoters. The dephosphorylation of TORC2 at Ser-171 in response to cAMP is insufficient to account for the dynamics of TORC2 localization and CREB activity in islet cells. Here, we identify Ser-275 of TORC2 as a 14-3-3 binding site that is phosphorylated under low glucose conditions and which becomes dephosphorylated by calcineurin in response to glucose influx. Dephosphorylation of Ser-275 is essential for both glucose and cAMP-mediated activation of CREB in beta cells and islets. Using a cell-based screen of 180 human protein kinases, we identified MARK2, a member of the AMPK family of Ser/Thr kinases, as a Ser-275 kinase that blocks TORC2:CREB activity. Taken together, these data provide the mechanistic underpinning for how cAMP and glucose cooperatively promote a transcriptional program critical for islet cell survival, and identifies MARK2 as a potential target for diabetes treatment."

Par6 was a component of the apical ES and the BTB. However, its level was considerably diminished at both sites at stage VIII of the cycle. Par6 also formed a stable complex with Pals1 and JAM-C (a component of the apical ES) in normal testes. When rats were treated with adjudin to induce apical ES restructuring without compromising the BTB, Par6 staining virtually disappeared at the apical ES in misaligned spermatids before their depletion. Additionally, the Par6/Pals1 complex became tightly associated with Src kinase, rendering a loss of association of the Par6/Pals1 complex with JAM-C, thereby destabilizing apical ES to facilitate spermatid loss. Primary Sertoli cell cultures with established functional BTB, but without apical ES, were next used to assess the Par6-based complex on BTB dynamics. When either Par6 or Par3 was knocked down by RNAi in Sertoli cell epithelium, a significant loss of the corresponding protein by approximately 60% in cells vs. controls was detected, alongside with a decline in aPKC after Par6, but not Par3, knockdown. This Par3 or Par6 knockdown also led to a transient loss of selected BTB proteins at the cell-cell interface, thereby compromising the BTB integrity. These findings illustrate that the Par6/Par3-based polarity complex likely coordinates the events of apical ES and BTB restructuring that take place concurrently at the opposing ends of adjacent Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis."

A putative cyanobacteriochrome, CcaS, is known to chromatically regulate the expression of the phycobilisome linker gene (cpcG2) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this study, we isolated the chromophore-binding domain of CcaS from Synechocystis as well as from phycocyanobilin-producing Escherichia coli. Both preparations showed the same reversible photoconversion between a green-absorbing form (Pg, lambda(max) = 535 nm) and a red-absorbing form (Pr, lambda(max) = 672 nm). Mass spectrometry and denaturation analyses suggested that Pg and Pr bind phycocyanobilin in a double-bond configuration of C15-Z and C15-E, respectively. Autophosphorylation activity of the histidine kinase domain in nearly full-length CcaS was up-regulated by preirradiation with green light. Similarly, phosphotransfer to the cognate response regulator, CcaR, was higher in Pr than in Pg. From these results, we conclude that CcaS phosphorylates CcaR under green light and induces expression of cpcG2, leading to accumulation of CpcG2-phycobilisome as a chromatic acclimation system. CcaS is the first recognized green light receptor in the expanded phytochrome superfamily, which includes phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes."

In most cases, stimuli-induced p100 processing is dependent on NF-kappaB-inducing kinase/IkappaB kinase alpha-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we report that post-translational modification of p100 at specific sites by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is another determining factor for stimuli-induced p100 processing. The results show that basal SUMO modification is required for stimuli-induced p100 phosphorylation and that blocking SUMOylation of p100, either by site-directed mutation or by short interfering RNA-targeted diminution of E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, inhibits various physiological stimuli-induced p100 processing and ultimate activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. Together, these findings show the crucial role of SUMO1 modification in p100 processing and provide mechanistic insights into the participation of SUMO1 modification in the regulation of signal transduction."
19520863,0,Mol. Cell Proteomics,101125647,2008,Proteomics identification of nuclear Ran GTPase as an inhibitor of human VRK1 and VRK2 (vaccinia-related kinase) activities.,"Human vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) 1 is a novel serine-threonine kinase that regulates several transcription factors, nuclear envelope assembly, and chromatin condensation and is also required for cell cycle progression. The regulation of this kinase family is unknown. Mass spectrometry has permitted the identification of Ran as an interacting and regulatory protein of the VRK serine-threonine kinase activities. The stable interaction has been validated by pulldown of endogenous proteins as well as by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. The three members of the VRK family stably interact with Ran, and the interaction was not affected by the bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP. The interaction was stronger with the RanT24N that is locked in its inactive conformation and cannot bind nucleotides. None of the kinases phosphorylated Ran or RCC1. VRK1 does not directly interact with RCC1, but if Ran is present they can be isolated as a complex. The main effect of the interaction of inactive RanGDP with VRK1 is the inhibition of its kinase activity, which was detected by a reduction in VRK1 autophosphorylation and a reduction in phosphorylation of histone H3 in residues Thr-3 and Ser-10. The kinase activity inhibition can be relieved by the interaction with the constitutively active RanGTP or RanL43E, which locks Ran in its GTP-bound active conformation. In this complex, the interaction with VRK proteins does not alter the effect of its guanine exchange factor, RCC1. Ran is a novel negative regulator of nuclear VRK1 and VRK2 kinase activity, which may vary in different subcellular localizations generating an asymmetric intracellular distribution of kinase activity depending on local protein interactions."
19520870,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Nuclear import of CaMV P6 is required for infection and suppression of the RNA silencing factor DRB4.,"Replication of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a plant double-stranded DNA virus, requires the viral translational transactivator protein P6. Although P6 is known to form cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (viroplasms) so far considered essential for virus biology, a fraction of the protein is also present in the nucleus. Here, we report that monomeric P6 is imported into the nucleus through two importin-alpha-dependent nuclear localization signals, and show that this process is mandatory for CaMV infectivity and is independent of translational transactivation and viroplasm formation. One nuclear function of P6 is to suppress RNA silencing, a gene regulation mechanism with antiviral roles, commonly counteracted by dedicated viral suppressor proteins (viral silencing suppressors; VSRs). Transgenic P6 expression in Arabidopsis is genetically equivalent to inactivating the nuclear protein DRB4 that facilitates the activity of the major plant antiviral silencing factor DCL4. We further show that a fraction of P6 immunoprecipitates with DRB4 in CaMV-infected cells. This study identifies both genetic and physical interactions between a VSR to a host RNA silencing component, and highlights the importance of subcellular compartmentalization in VSR function."
19521339,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Huntingtin phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch for anterograde/retrograde transport in neurons.,"The transport of vesicles in neurons is a highly regulated process, with vesicles moving either anterogradely or retrogradely depending on the nature of the molecular motors, kinesins and dynein, respectively, which propel vesicles along microtubules (MTs). However, the mechanisms that determine the directionality of transport remain unclear. Huntingtin, the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, is a positive regulatory factor for vesicular transport. Huntingtin is phosphorylated at serine 421 by the kinase Akt but the role of this modification is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of wild-type huntingtin at S421 is crucial to control the direction of vesicles in neurons. When phosphorylated, huntingtin recruits kinesin-1 to the dynactin complex on vesicles and MTs. Using brain-derived neurotrophic factor as a marker of vesicular transport, we demonstrate that huntingtin phosphorylation promotes anterograde transport. Conversely, when huntingtin is not phosphorylated, kinesin-1 detaches and vesicles are more likely to undergo retrograde transport. This also applies to other vesicles suggesting an essential role for huntingtin in the control of vesicular directionality in neurons."
19521496,0,Cell,413066,2008,WHAMM is an Arp2/3 complex activator that binds microtubules and functions in ER to Golgi transport.,"The Arp2/3 complex is an actin nucleator that plays a critical role in many cellular processes. Its activities are regulated by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) that function primarily during plasma membrane dynamics. Here we identify a mammalian NPF called WHAMM (WASP homolog associated with actin, membranes, and microtubules) that localizes to the cis-Golgi apparatus and tubulo-vesicular membrane transport intermediates. The modular organization of WHAMM includes an N-terminal domain that mediates Golgi membrane association, a coiled-coil region that binds microtubules, and a WCA segment that stimulates Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Overexpression and depletion studies indicate that WHAMM is important for maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating anterograde membrane transport. The ability of WHAMM to interact with microtubules plays a role in membrane tubulation, while its capacity to induce actin assembly promotes tubule elongation. Thus, WHAMM is an important regulator of membrane dynamics functioning at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons."
19521510,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structural basis for the recognition of c-Src by its inactivator Csk.,"The catalytic activity of the Src family of tyrosine kinases is suppressed by phosphorylation on a tyrosine residue located near the C terminus (Tyr 527 in c-Src), which is catalyzed by C-terminal Src Kinase (Csk). Given the promiscuity of most tyrosine kinases, it is remarkable that the C-terminal tails of the Src family kinases are the only known targets of Csk. We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the kinase domains of Csk and c-Src at 2.9 A resolution, revealing that interactions between these kinases position the C-terminal tail of c-Src at the edge of the active site of Csk. Csk cannot phosphorylate substrates that lack this docking mechanism because the conventional substrate binding site used by most tyrosine kinases to recognize substrates is destabilized in Csk by a deletion in the activation loop."
19521512,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Novel intermolecular iterative mechanism for biosynthesis of mycoketide catalyzed by a bimodular polyketide synthase.,"In recent years, remarkable versatility of polyketide synthases (PKSs) has been recognized; both in terms of their structural and functional organization as well as their ability to produce compounds other than typical secondary metabolites. Multifunctional Type I PKSs catalyze the biosynthesis of polyketide products by either using the same active sites repetitively (iterative) or by using these catalytic domains only once (modular) during the entire biosynthetic process. The largest open reading frame in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pks12, was recently proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of mannosyl-beta-1-phosphomycoketide (MPM). The PKS12 protein contains two complete sets of modules and has been suggested to synthesize mycoketide by five alternating condensations of methylmalonyl and malonyl units by using an iterative mode of catalysis. The bimodular iterative catalysis would require transfer of intermediate chains from acyl carrier protein domain of module 2 to ketosynthase domain of module 1. Such bimodular iterations during PKS biosynthesis have not been characterized and appear unlikely based on recent understanding of the three-dimensional organization of these proteins. Moreover, all known examples of iterative PKSs so far characterized involve unimodular iterations. Based on cell-free reconstitution of PKS12 enzymatic machinery, in this study, we provide the first evidence for a novel &quot;modularly iterative&quot; mechanism of biosynthesis. By combination of biochemical, computational, mutagenic, analytical ultracentrifugation and atomic force microscopy studies, we propose that PKS12 protein is organized as a large supramolecular assembly mediated through specific interactions between the C- and N-terminus linkers. PKS12 protein thus forms a modular assembly to perform repetitive condensations analogous to iterative proteins. This novel intermolecular iterative biosynthetic mechanism provides new perspective to our understanding of polyketide biosynthetic machinery and also suggests new ways to engineer polyketide metabolites. The characterization of novel molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of mycobacterial virulent lipids has opened new avenues for drug discovery."
19521520,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2008,The C/H3 domain of p300 is required to protect VRK1 and VRK2 from their downregulation induced by p53.,"BACKGROUND: The vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) protein, an activator of p53, can be proteolytically downregulated by an indirect mechanism, which requires p53-dependent transcription. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work we have biochemically characterized the contribution of several p53 transcriptional cofactors with acetyl transferase activity to the induction of VRK1 downregulation that was used as a functional assay. Downregulation of VRK1 induced by p53 is prevented in a dose dependent manner by either p300 or CBP, but not by PCAF, used as transcriptional co-activators, suggesting that p53 has a different specificity depending on the relative level of these transcriptional cofactors. This inhibition does not require p53 acetylation, since a p53 acetylation mutant also induces VRK1 downregulation. PCAF can not revert the VRK1 protection effect of p300, indicating that these two proteins do not compete for a common factor needed to induce VRK1 downregulation. The protective effect is also induced by the C/H3 domain of p300, a region implicated in binding to several transcription factors and SV40 large T antigen; but the protective effect is lost when a mutant C/H3Del33 is used. The protective effect is a consequence of direct binding of the C/H3 domain to the transactivation domain of p53. A similar downregulatory effect can also be detected with VRK2 protein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Specific p53-dependent effects are determined by the availability and ratios of its transcriptional cofactors. Specifically, the downregulation of VRK1/VRK2 protein levels, as a consequence of p53 accumulation, is thus dependent on the levels of the p300/CBP protein available for transcriptional complexes, since in this context this cofactor functions as a repressor of the effect. These observations point to the relevance of knowing the cofactor levels in order to determine one effect or another."

Defining the structures of proteins involved in the import and degradation of specific glycans by saccharolytic bacteria complements genomic analysis of the nutrient-processing capabilities of gut communities. Here, we describe the atomic structure of one such protein, SusD, required for starch binding and utilization by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent adaptive forager of glycans in the distal human gut microbiota. The binding pocket of this unique alpha-helical protein contains an arc of aromatic residues that complements the natural helical structure of starch and imposes this conformation on bound maltoheptaose. Furthermore, SusD binds cyclic oligosaccharides with higher affinity than linear forms. The structures of several SusD/oligosaccharide complexes reveal an inherent ligand recognition plasticity dominated by the three-dimensional conformation of the oligosaccharides rather than specific interactions with the composite sugars."

Electrophysiological measurements show that drug-resistant mutations have minimal effects on M2's specific activity, and suggest that resistance is achieved by altering a binding site within the pore rather than a less direct allosteric mechanism. In parallel, we measure the effects of these mutations on the free energy of assembling the homotetrameric transmembrane pore from monomeric helices in micelles and bilayers. Although there is no simple correlation between the evolutionary fitness of the mutants and their stability, all variants formed more stable tetramers in bilayers, and the least-fit mutants showed the smallest increase in stability upon moving from a micelle to a bilayer environment. We speculate that the folding landscape of a micelle is rougher than that of a bilayer, and more accommodating of conformational variations in nonoptimized mutants."

In Escherichia coli, the lysine methyltransferase PrmA trimethylates the N-terminal alpha-amino group and the epsilon-amino groups of Lys3 and Lys39. Here, we report four PrmA-L11 complex structures in different orientations with respect to the PrmA active site. Two structures capture the L11 N-terminal alpha-amino group in the active site in a trimethylated post-catalytic state and in a dimethylated state with bound S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. Two other structures show L11 in a catalytic orientation to modify Lys39 and in a noncatalytic orientation. The comparison of complex structures in different orientations with a minimal substrate recognition complex shows that the binding mode remains conserved in all L11 orientations, and that substrate orientation is brought about by the unusual interdomain flexibility of PrmA."

We report the structure of a DAG kinase, DgkB from Staphylococcus aureus, both as the free enzyme and in complex with ADP. The molecule is a tight homodimer, and each monomer comprises two domains with the catalytic center located within the interdomain cleft. Two distinctive features of DkgB are a structural Mg2+ site and an associated Asp*water*Mg2+ network that extends toward the active site locale. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that these features play important roles in the catalytic mechanism. The key active site residues and the components of the Asp*water*Mg2+ network are conserved in the catalytic cores of the mammalian signaling DAG kinases, indicating that these enzymes use the same mechanism and have similar structures as DgkB."
19522030,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Structural basis for dimerization in DNA recognition by Gal4.,"Gal4 is a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster containing transcription factor that binds DNA as a homodimer and can activate transcription by interacting with the mutant Gal11P protein. Although structures have been reported of the Gal4 dimerization domain and the binuclear cluster domain bound to DNA as a dimer, the structure of the &quot;complete&quot; Gal4 dimer bound to DNA has not previously been described. Here we report the structure of a complete Gal4 dimer bound to DNA and additional biochemical studies to address the molecular basis for Gal4 dimerization in DNA binding. We find that Gal4 dimerization on DNA is mediated by an intertwined helical bundle that deviates significantly from the solution NMR structure of the free dimerization domain. Associated biochemical studies show that the dimerization domain of Gal4 is important for DNA binding and protein thermostability. We also map the interaction surface of the Gal4 dimerization domain with Gal11P."

Here, we demonstrate that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) has an important regulatory function in the commitment of Th17 cells. Ahr was robustly induced under Th17-polarizing conditions. Ahr-deficient naïve T cells showed a considerable loss in the ability to differentiate into Th17 cells when induced by TGF-beta plus IL-6. We were able to demonstrate that Ahr interacts with Stat1 and Stat5, which negatively regulate Th17 development. Whereas Stat1 activation returned to its basal level in Ahr wild type naïve T cells 24 h after stimulation with TGF-beta plus IL-6, Stat1 remained activated in Ahr-deficient naïve T cells after stimulation. These results indicate that Ahr participates in Th17 cell differentiation through regulating Stat1 activation, a finding that constitutes additional mechanisms in the modulation of Th17 cell development."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Removal of sialic acid involving Klotho causes cell-surface retention of TRPV5 channel via binding to galectin-1.,"Klotho is a mammalian senescence-suppression protein that has homology with glycosidases. The extracellular domain of Klotho is secreted into urine and blood and may function as a humoral factor. Klotho-deficient mice have accelerated aging and imbalance of ion homeostasis. Klotho treatment increases cell-surface abundance of the renal epithelial Ca(2+) channel TRPV5 by modifying its N-linked glycans. However, the precise sugar substrate and mechanism for regulation by Klotho is not known. Here, we report that the extracellular domain of Klotho activates plasma-membrane resident TRPV5 through removing terminal sialic acids from their glycan chains. Removal of sialic acids exposes underlying disaccharide galactose-N-acetylglucosamine, a ligand for a ubiquitous galactoside-binding lectin galectin-1. Binding to galectin-1 lattice at the extracellular surface leads to accumulation of functional TRPV5 on the plasma membrane. Knockdown of beta-galactoside alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal-1) by RNA interference, but not other sialyltransferases, in a human cell line prevents the regulation by Klotho. Moreover, the regulation by Klotho is absent in a hamster cell line that lacks endogenous ST6Gal-1, but is restored by forced expression of recombinant ST6Gal-1. Thus, Klotho participates in specific removal of alpha2,6-linked sialic acids and regulates cell surface retention of TRPV5 through this activity. This action of Klotho represents a novel mechanism for regulation of the activity of cell-surface glycoproteins and likely contributes to maintenance of calcium balance by Klotho."

We report here the structure of the complex formed by yeast eIF4G's middle domain and full-length eIF4A at 2.6-A resolution. eIF4A shows an extended conformation where eIF4G holds its crucial DEAD-box sequence motifs in a productive conformation, thus explaining the stimulation of eIF4A's activity. A hitherto undescribed interaction involves the amino acid Trp-579 of eIF4G. Mutation to alanine results in decreased binding to eIF4A and a temperature-sensitive phenotype of yeast cells that carry a Trp579Ala mutation as its sole source for eIF4G. Conformational changes between eIF4A's closed and open state provide a model for its RNA-helicase activity."

In this study, murine embryo fibroblast (MEFs) and mice lacking the gene were used to demonstrate a novel role of ISG15 as a host defense molecule against vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. In MEFs, the growth of replication competent Western Reserve (WR) VACV strain was affected by the absence of ISG15, but in addition, virus lacking E3 protein (VVDeltaE3L) that is unable to grow in ISG15+/+ cells replicated in ISG15-deficient cells. Inhibiting ISG15 with siRNA or promoting its expression in ISG15-/- cells with a lentivirus vector showed that VACV replication was controlled by ISG15. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that E3 binds ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The VACV antiviral action of ISG15 and its interaction with E3 are events independent of PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase). In mice lacking ISG15, infection with VVDeltaE3L caused significant disease and mortality, an effect not observed in VVDeltaE3L-infected ISG15+/+ mice. Pathogenesis in ISG15-deficient mice infected with VVDeltaE3L or with an E3L deletion mutant virus lacking the C-terminal domain triggered an enhanced inflammatory response in the lungs compared with ISG15+/+-infected mice. These findings showed an anti-VACV function of ISG15, with the virus E3 protein suppressing the action of the ISG15 antiviral factor."
19522508,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2008,AGL61 interacts with AGL80 and is required for central cell development in Arabidopsis.,"The central cell of the female gametophyte plays a role in pollen tube guidance and in regulating the initiation of endosperm development. Following fertilization, the central cell gives rise to the seed's endosperm, which nourishes the developing embryo within the seed. The molecular mechanisms controlling specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly understood. We identified AGL61 in a screen for transcription factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte. AGL61 encodes a Type I MADS domain protein, which likely functions as a transcription factor. Consistent with this, an AGL61-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. In the context of the ovule and seed, AGL61 is expressed exclusively in the central cell and early endosperm. agl61 female gametophytes are affected in the central cell specifically. The morphological defects include an overall reduction in size of the central cell and a reduced or absent central cell vacuole. When fertilized with wild-type pollen, agl61 central cells fail to give rise to endosperm. In addition, synergid- and antipodal-expressed genes are ectopically expressed in agl61 central cells. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype of AGL61 are similar to those of AGL80, suggesting that AGL61 may function as a heterodimer with AGL80 within the central cell; consistent with this, AGL61 and AGL80 interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. Together, these data suggest that AGL61 functions as a transcription factor and controls the expression of downstream genes during central cell development."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Atomic resolution structural characterization of recognition of histo-blood group antigens by Norwalk virus.,"Members of Norovirus, a genus in the family Caliciviridae, are causative agents of epidemic diarrhea in humans. Susceptibility to several noroviruses is linked to human histo-blood type, and its determinant histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are regarded as receptors for these viruses. Specificity for these carbohydrates is strain-dependent. Norwalk virus (NV) is the prototype genogroup I norovirus that specifically recognizes A- and H-type HBGA, in contrast to genogroup II noroviruses that exhibit a more diverse HBGA binding pattern. To understand the structural basis for how HBGAs interact with the NV capsid protein, and how the specificity is achieved, we carried out x-ray crystallographic analysis of the capsid protein domain by itself and in complex with A- and H-type HBGA at a resolution of approximately 1.4 A. Despite differences in their carbohydrate sequence and linkage, both HBGAs bind to the same surface-exposed site in the capsid protein and project outward from the capsid surface, substantiating their possible role in initiating cell attachment. Precisely juxtaposed polar side chains that engage the sugar hydroxyls in a cooperative hydrogen bonding and a His/Trp pair involved in a cation-pi interaction contribute to selective and specific recognition of A- and H-type HBGAs. This unique binding epitope, confirmed by mutational analysis, is highly conserved, but only in the genogroup I noroviruses, suggesting that a mechanism by which noroviruses infect broader human populations is by evolving different sites with altered HBGA specificities."
19522701,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Integration of auxin and brassinosteroid pathways by Auxin Response Factor 2.,"Plant form is shaped by a complex network of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Light-directed growth of seedlings (photomorphogenesis) depends on the coordination of several hormone signals, including brassinosteroids (BRs) and auxin. Although the close relationship between BRs and auxin has been widely reported, the molecular mechanism for combinatorial control of shared target genes has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that BRs synergistically increase seedling sensitivity to auxin and show that combined treatment with both hormones can increase the magnitude and duration of gene expression. Moreover, we describe a direct connection between the BR-regulated BIN2 kinase and ARF2, a member of the Auxin Response Factor family of transcriptional regulators. Phosphorylation by BIN2 results in loss of ARF2 DNA binding and repression activities. arf2 mutants are less sensitive to changes in endogenous BR levels, whereas a large proportion of genes affected in an arf2 background are returned to near wild-type levels by altering BR biosynthesis. Together, these data suggest a model where BIN2 increases expression of auxin-induced genes by directly inactivating repressor ARFs, leading to synergistic increases in transcription."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,A myosin motor that selects bundled actin for motility.,"Eukaryotic cells organize their contents through trafficking along cytoskeletal filaments. The leading edge of a typical metazoan cytoskeleton consists of a dense and complex arrangement of cortical actin. A dendritic mesh is found across the broad lamellopodium, with long parallel bundles at microspikes and filopodia. It is currently unclear whether and how myosin motors identify the few actin filaments that lead to the correct destination, when presented with many similar alternatives within the cortex. Here we show that myosin X, an actin-based motor that concentrates at the distal tips of filopodia, selects the fascin-actin bundle at the filopodial core for motility. Myosin X moves individual actin filaments poorly in vitro, often supercoiling actin into plectonemes. However, single myosin X motors move robustly and processively along fascin-actin bundles. This selection requires only parallel, closely spaced filaments, as myosin X is also processive on artificial actin bundles formed by molecular crowding. Myosin X filopodial localization is perturbed in fascin-depleted HeLa cells, demonstrating that fascin bundles also direct motility in vivo. Our results demonstrate that myosin X recognizes the local structural arrangement of filaments in long bundles, providing a mechanism for sorting cargo to distant target sites."
19523210,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Agonist-selective signaling is determined by the receptor location within the membrane domains.,"The basis for agonist-selective signaling was investigated by using the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) as a model. In the absence of agonist, MOR located within the lipid raft domains, whereas etorphine, but not morphine, induced the translocation of MOR from lipid raft to nonraft domains, similar to the action of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The etorphine-induced MOR translocation required the dissociation of the receptor from Galphai2 first and then the binding of beta-arrestin. In contrast, the low affinity of the morphine-MOR complex for beta-arrestin and the rebinding of Galphai2 after GTP hydrolysis retained the complex within the lipid raft domains. Disruption of the MOR-Galphai2 interaction, either by deleting the (276)RRITR(280) sequence of MOR or knocking down the level of Galphai2, resulted in the translocation of MOR to the nonraft domains. In addition, lipid raft location of MOR was critical for G protein-dependent signaling, such as etorphine- and morphine-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and morphine-induced ERK phosphorylation, whereas beta-arrestin-dependent, etorphine-induced ERK phosphorylation required MOR to translocate into the nonraft domains. Thus, agonist-selective signaling is regulated by the location of MOR, which is determined by interactions of MOR with G proteins and beta-arrestin."

IL-22 biological activity is initiated by binding to a cell-surface complex composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains and further regulated by interactions with a soluble binding protein, IL-22BP, which shares sequence similarity with an extracellular region of IL-22R1 (sIL-22R1). IL-22R1 also pairs with the IL-20R2 chain to induce IL-20 and IL-24 signaling. To define the molecular basis of these diverse interactions, we have determined the structure of the IL-22/sIL-22R1 complex. The structure, combined with homology modeling and surface plasmon resonance studies, defines the molecular basis for the distinct affinities and specificities of IL-22 and IL-10 receptor chains that regulate cellular targeting and signal transduction to elicit effective immune responses."
19523447,1,Cancer Cell,101130617,2008,Menin critically links MLL proteins with LEDGF on cancer-associated target genes.,"Menin displays the unique ability to either promote oncogenic function in the hematopoietic lineage or suppress tumorigenesis in the endocrine lineage; however, its molecular mechanism of action has not been defined. We demonstrate here that these discordant functions are unified by menin's ability to serve as a molecular adaptor that physically links the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) histone methyltransferase with LEDGF (lens epithelium-derived growth factor), a chromatin-associated protein previously implicated in leukemia, autoimmunity, and HIV-1 pathogenesis. LEDGF is required for both MLL-dependent transcription and leukemic transformation. Conversely, a subset of menin mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients abrogate interaction with LEDGF while preserving MLL interaction but nevertheless compromise MLL/menin-dependent functions. Thus, LEDGF critically associates with MLL and menin at the nexus of transcriptional pathways that are recurrently targeted in diverse diseases."
19523449,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Novel type of Ras effector interaction established between tumour suppressor NORE1A and Ras switch II.,"A class of putative Ras effectors called Ras association domain family (RASSF) represents non-enzymatic adaptors that were shown to be important in tumour suppression. RASSF5, a member of this family, exists in two splice variants known as NORE1A and RAPL. Both of them are involved in distinct cellular pathways triggered by Ras and Rap, respectively. Here we describe the crystal structure of Ras in complex with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of NORE1A/RAPL. All Ras effectors share a common topology in their RBD creating an interface with the switch I region of Ras, whereas NORE1A/RAPL RBD reveals additional structural elements forming a unique Ras switch II binding site. Consequently, the contact area of NORE1A is extended as compared with other Ras effectors. We demonstrate that the enlarged interface provides a rationale for an exceptionally long lifetime of the complex. This is a specific attribute characterizing the effector function of NORE1A/RAPL as adaptors, in contrast to classical enzymatic effectors such as Raf, RalGDS or PI3K, which are known to form highly dynamic short-lived complexes with Ras."
19523473,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,Both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 have high affinity for growth and differentiation factors 8 and 11.,"WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 are large extracellular multidomain proteins consisting of a WAP, a follistatin, an immunoglobulin, two Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains, and an NTR domain. Recent experiments have shown that WFIKKN2 protein binds mature GDF8/myostatin and myostatin propeptide and inhibits the biological activity of myostatin (Hill, J. J., Qiu, Y., Hewick, R. M., and Wolfman, N. M. (2003) Mol. Endocrinol. 17, 1144-1154). Here we show that the paralogue of this protein, WFIKKN1, also binds to both myostatin and myostatin propeptide and that both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 bind GDF11, the growth and differentiation factor most closely related to myostatin, with high affinity. Structure-function studies on WFIKKN1 have revealed that the follistatin domain is primarily responsible for the binding of mature growth factor, whereas the NTR domain contributes most significantly to the interaction with myostatin propeptide. Analysis of the evolutionary histories of WFIKKN1/WFIKKN2 and GDF8/GDF11 proteins indicates that the functional association of an ancestral WFIKKN protein with an ancestor of GDF8/11 may date back to cephalochordates/urochordates. Although duplication of the corresponding genes gave rise to WFIKKN1/WFIKKN2 and GDF8/GDF11 in early vertebrates, the data presented here suggest that there is significant functional overlap of the paralogous proteins."

Far from being inert, ssDNA/SSB complexes are dynamic DNA processing centers where many different enzymes gain access to genomic substrates by exploiting direct interactions with SSB. In all cases examined to date, the C terminus of SSB (SSB-Ct) forms the docking site for heterologous proteins. We describe the 2.7-A-resolution crystal structure of a complex formed between a peptide comprising the SSB-Ct element and exonuclease I (ExoI) from Escherichia coli. Two SSB-Ct peptides bind to adjacent sites on ExoI. Mutagenesis studies indicate that one of these sites is important for association with the SSB-Ct peptide in solution and for SSB stimulation of ExoI activity, whereas the second has no discernable function. These studies identify a correlation between the stability of the ExoI/SSB-Ct complex and SSB-stimulation of ExoI activity. Furthermore, mutations within SSB's C terminus produce variants that fail to stimulate ExoI activity, whereas the SSB-Ct peptide alone has no effect. Together, our findings indicate that SSB stimulates ExoI by recruiting the enzyme to its substrate and provide a structural paradigm for understanding SSB's organizational role in genome maintenance."

Direct sequencing of SNTA1, the gene encoding alpha1-syntrophin, was performed in a cohort of LQTS patients that were negative for mutations in the 11 known LQTS-susceptibility genes. A missense mutation (A390V-SNTA1) was found in a patient with recurrent syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval (QTc, 530 ms). SNTA1 links neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the nNOS inhibitor plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b); SNTA1 also is known to associate with the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A. By using a GST-fusion protein of the C terminus of SCN5A, we showed that WT-SNTA1 interacted with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b. In contrast, A390V-SNTA1 selectively disrupted association of PMCA4b with this complex and increased direct nitrosylation of SCN5A. A390V-SNTA1 expressed with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b in heterologous cells increased peak and late sodium current compared with WT-SNTA1, and the increase was partially inhibited by NOS blockers. Expression of A390V-SNTA1 in cardiac myocytes also increased late sodium current. We conclude that the A390V mutation disrupted binding with PMCA4b, released inhibition of nNOS, caused S-nitrosylation of SCN5A, and was associated with increased late sodium current, which is the characteristic biophysical dysfunction for sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3). These results establish an SNTA1-based nNOS complex attached to SCN5A as a key regulator of sodium current and suggest that SNTA1 be considered a rare LQTS-susceptibility gene."
19523849,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the partitioning of STAT1 between different dimer conformations.,"The activation/inactivation cycle of STAT transcription factors entails their transition between different dimer conformations. Unphosphorylated STATs can dimerize in an antiparallel conformation via extended interfaces of the globular N-domains, whereas STAT activation triggers a parallel dimer conformation with mutual phosphortyrosine:SH2 domain interactions, resulting in DNA-binding and nuclear retention. However, despite the crucial role of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in cytokine signaling, it has not been determined how this modification affects the stability and the conformational flexibility of STAT dimers. Here, we use analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to study the association of STAT1 in solution before and after tyrosine phosphorylation. It is revealed that STAT1 formed high-affinity dimers (K(d) of approximately 50 nM) with estimated half-lives of 20-40 min irrespective of the phosphorylation status. Our results demonstrate that parallel and antiparallel conformations of STAT1 were present simultaneously, supported by mutually exclusive interfaces; and the transition between conformations occurred through affinity-driven dissociation/association reactions. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation was dispensable for DNA binding, but the phosphorylation enforced preformed SH2 domain-mediated dimers, thus enhancing the DNA-binding activity of STAT1 &gt;200-fold. Moreover, upon STAT1 activation the N-domains adopted an open conformation and engaged in interdimer interactions, as demonstrated by their participation in tetramerization instead of dimerization. Yet, homotypic N-domain interactions are not conserved in the STAT family, because the N-domain dissociation constants of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 differed by more than three orders of magnitude. In conclusion, STAT1 constantly oscillated between different dimer conformations, whereby the abundance of the dimerization interfaces was determined by tyrosine phosphorylation."
19523922,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Two distinct interacting classes of nuclear envelope-associated coiled-coil proteins are required for the tissue-specific nuclear envelope targeting of Arabidopsis RanGAP.,"Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope (NE) reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the NE and is associated with the outer surface of the NE in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip NE requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs). We have now identified, by tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP NE association in root tip cells. A combination of loss-of-function mutant analysis and protein interaction data indicates that at least one member of each NE-associated CC-TMD protein family is required for RanGAP targeting in root tip cells, while both families are dispensable in other plant tissues. This suggests an unanticipated complexity of RanGAP NE targeting in higher plant cells, contrasting both the single nucleoporin anchor in metazoans and the lack of targeting in fungi and proposes an early evolutionary divergence of the underlying plant and animal mechanisms."

However, m(5)C deamination yields mutagenic G.T mispairs, which are implicated in genetic disease, cancer, and aging. Human thymine DNA glycosylase (hTDG) removes T from G.T mispairs, producing an abasic (or AP) site, and follow-on base excision repair proteins restore the G.C pair. hTDG is inactive against normal A.T pairs, and is most effective for G.T mispairs and other damage located in a CpG context. The molecular basis of these important catalytic properties has remained unknown. Here, we report a crystal structure of hTDG (catalytic domain, hTDG(cat)) in complex with abasic DNA, at 2.8 A resolution. Surprisingly, the enzyme crystallized in a 2:1 complex with DNA, one subunit bound at the abasic site, as anticipated, and the other at an undamaged (nonspecific) site. Isothermal titration calorimetry and electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments indicate that hTDG and hTDG(cat) can bind abasic DNA with 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometry. Kinetics experiments show that the 1:1 complex is sufficient for full catalytic (base excision) activity, suggesting that the 2:1 complex, if adopted in vivo, might be important for some other activity of hTDG, perhaps binding interactions with other proteins. Our structure reveals interactions that promote the stringent specificity for guanine versus adenine as the pairing partner of the target base and interactions that likely confer CpG sequence specificity. We find striking differences between hTDG and its prokaryotic ortholog (MUG), despite the relatively high (32%) sequence identity."

In addition to its importance in human health, there is growing interest in adapting HBV and other viruses for drug delivery and other nanotechnological applications. In both contexts, precise biophysical characterization of these large macromolecular particles is fundamental. HBV capsids are unusual in that they exhibit two distinct icosahedral geometries, nominally composed of 90 and 120 dimers with masses of approximately 3 and approximately 4 MDa, respectively. Here, a mass spectrometric approach was used to determine the masses of both capsids to within 0.1%. It follows that both lattices are complete, consisting of exactly 180 and 240 subunits. Nanoindentation experiments by atomic-force microscopy indicate that both capsids have similar stabilities. The data yielded a Young's modulus of approximately 0.4 GPa. This experimental approach, anchored on very precise and accurate mass measurements, appears to hold considerable potential for elucidating the assembly of viruses and other macromolecular particles."

Here, we examine a series of peptides with backbones that feature different repeating patterns of alpha- and beta-amino acid residues but an invariant side-chain sequence. In the pure alpha-backbone, this sequence corresponds to the previously studied peptide GCN4-pLI, which forms a very stable four-helix bundle quaternary structure. Physical characterization in solution and crystallographic structure determination show that a variety of alpha/beta-peptide backbones can adopt sequence-encoded quaternary structures similar to that of the alpha prototype. There is a loss in helix bundle stability upon beta-residue incorporation; however, stability of the quaternary structure is not a simple function of beta-residue content. We find that cyclically constrained beta-amino acid residues can stabilize the folds of alpha/beta-peptide GCN4-pLI analogues and restore quaternary structure formation to backbones that are predominantly unfolded in the absence of cyclic residues. Our results show a surprising degree of plasticity in terms of the backbone compositions that can manifest the structural information encoded in a sequence of amino acid side chains. These findings offer a framework for the design of nonnatural oligomers that mimic the structural and functional properties of proteins."

This process is initiated by the binding of extracellular NSP4 to target molecule(s) on the cell surface that triggers a signaling cascade leading to diarrhea. We now report that the integrins alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 are receptors for NSP4. NSP4 specifically binds to the alpha1 and alpha2 I domains with apparent K(d) = 1-2.7 muM. Binding is mediated by the I domain metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, requires Mg(2+) or Mn(2+), is abolished with EDTA, and an NSP4 point mutant, E(120)A, fails to bind alpha2 integrin I domain. NSP4 has two distinct integrin interaction domains. NSP4 amino acids 114-130 are essential for binding to the I domain, and NSP4 peptide 114-135 blocks binding of the natural ligand, collagen I, to integrin alpha2. NSP4 amino acids 131-140 are not associated with the initial binding to the I domain, but elicit signaling that leads to the spreading of attached C2C12-alpha2 cells, mouse myoblast cells stably expressing the human alpha2 integrin. NSP4 colocalizes with integrin alpha2 on the basolateral surface of rotavirus-infected polarized intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells as well as surrounding noninfected cells. NSP4 mutants that fail to bind or signal through integrin alpha2 were attenuated in diarrhea induction in neonatal mice. These results indicate that NSP4 interaction with integrin alpha1 and alpha2 is an important component of enterotoxin function and rotavirus pathogenesis, further distinguishing this viral virulence factor from other microbial enterotoxins."
19524503,1,Cell,413066,2008,DSCAM is a netrin receptor that collaborates with DCC in mediating turning responses to netrin-1.,"During nervous system development, spinal commissural axons project toward and across the ventral midline. They are guided in part by netrin-1, made by midline cells, which attracts the axons by activating the netrin receptor DCC. However, previous studies suggest that additional receptor components are required. Here, we report that the Down's syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM), a candidate gene implicated in the mental retardation phenotype of Down's syndrome, is expressed on spinal commissural axons, binds netrin-1, and is necessary for commissural axons to grow toward and across the midline. DSCAM and DCC can each mediate a turning response of these neurons to netrin-1. Similarly, Xenopus spinal neurons exogenously expressing DSCAM can be attracted by netrin-1 independently of DCC. These results show that DSCAM is a receptor that can mediate turning responses to netrin-1 and support a key role for netrin/DSCAM signaling in commissural axon guidance in vertebrates."
19524513,1,Cell,413066,2008,The structural basis for activation of the Rab Ypt1p by the TRAPP membrane-tethering complexes.,"The multimeric membrane-tethering complexes TRAPPI and TRAPPII share seven subunits, of which four (Bet3p, Bet5p, Trs23p, and Trs31p) are minimally needed to activate the Rab GTPase Ypt1p in an event preceding membrane fusion. Here, we present the structure of a heteropentameric TRAPPI assembly complexed with Ypt1p. We propose that TRAPPI facilitates nucleotide exchange primarily by stabilizing the nucleotide-binding pocket of Ypt1p in an open, solvent-accessible form. Bet3p, Bet5p, and Trs23p interact directly with Ypt1p to stabilize this form, while the C terminus of Bet3p invades the pocket to participate in its remodeling. The Trs31p subunit does not interact directly with the GTPase but allosterically regulates the TRAPPI interface with Ypt1p. Our findings imply that TRAPPII activates Ypt1p by an identical mechanism. This view of a multimeric membrane-tethering assembly complexed with a Rab provides a framework for understanding events preceding membrane fusion at the molecular level."
19524515,1,Cell,413066,2008,Ronin is essential for embryogenesis and the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells.,"Pluripotency is a unique biological state that allows cells to differentiate into any tissue type. Here we describe a candidate pluripotency factor, Ronin, that possesses a THAP domain, which is associated with sequence-specific DNA binding and epigenetic silencing of gene expression. Ronin is expressed primarily during the earliest stages of murine embryonic development, and its deficiency in mice produces periimplantational lethality and defects in the inner cell mass. Conditional knockout of Ronin prevents the growth of ES cells while forced expression of Ronin allows ES cells to proliferate without differentiation under conditions that normally do not promote self-renewal. Ectopic expression also partly compensates for the effects of Oct4 knockdown. We demonstrate that Ronin binds directly to HCF-1, a key transcriptional regulator. Our findings identify Ronin as an essential factor underlying embryogenesis and ES cell pluripotency. Its association with HCF-1 suggests an epigenetic mechanism of gene repression in pluripotent cells."
19524525,0,Cell,413066,2008,"A polymorphism in CALHM1 influences Ca2+ homeostasis, Abeta levels, and Alzheimer's disease risk.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by early hippocampal atrophy and cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition. Using TissueInfo to screen for genes preferentially expressed in the hippocampus and located in AD linkage regions, we identified a gene on 10q24.33 that we call CALHM1. We show that CALHM1 encodes a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein that controls cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and Abeta levels. CALHM1 homomultimerizes, shares strong sequence similarities with the selectivity filter of the NMDA receptor, and generates a large Ca(2+) conductance across the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that the CALHM1 P86L polymorphism (rs2986017) is significantly associated with AD in independent case-control studies of 3404 participants (allele-specific OR = 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)). We further found that the P86L polymorphism increases Abeta levels by interfering with CALHM1-mediated Ca(2+) permeability. We propose that CALHM1 encodes an essential component of a previously uncharacterized cerebral Ca(2+) channel that controls Abeta levels and susceptibility to late-onset AD."
19524533,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Implementing the LIM code: the structural basis for cell type-specific assembly of LIM-homeodomain complexes.,"LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors form a combinatorial 'LIM code' that contributes to the specification of cell types. In the ventral spinal cord, the binary LIM homeobox protein 3 (Lhx3)/LIM domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb1) complex specifies the formation of V2 interneurons. The additional expression of islet-1 (Isl1) in adjacent cells instead specifies the formation of motor neurons through assembly of a ternary complex in which Isl1 contacts both Lhx3 and Ldb1, displacing Lhx3 as the binding partner of Ldb1. However, little is known about how this molecular switch occurs. Here, we have identified the 30-residue Lhx3-binding domain on Isl1 (Isl1(LBD)). Although the LIM interaction domain of Ldb1 (Ldb1(LID)) and Isl1(LBD) share low levels of sequence homology, X-ray and NMR structures reveal that they bind Lhx3 in an identical manner, that is, Isl1(LBD) mimics Ldb1(LID). These data provide a structural basis for the formation of cell type-specific protein-protein interactions in which unstructured linear motifs with diverse sequences compete to bind protein partners. The resulting alternate protein complexes can target different genes to regulate key biological events."

We identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX3X as an interaction partner of TBK1. TBK1 and DDX3X acted synergistically in their ability to stimulate the IFN promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated reduction of DDX3X expression led to an impairment of IFN production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that DDX3X is recruited to the IFN promoter upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism of action. DDX3X was found to be a TBK1 substrate in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants of DDX3X failed to synergize with TBK1 in their ability to stimulate the IFN promoter. Overall, our data imply that DDX3X is a critical effector of TBK1 that is necessary for type I IFN induction."
19524995,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Induction of a pro-apoptotic ATM-NF-kappaB pathway and its repression by ATR in response to replication stress.,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB has critical functions in biologic responses to genotoxic stimuli. Activation of NF-kappaB in response to DNA double strand break (DSB) inducers can be mediated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-dependent phosphorylation of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator). Here, we show that the replication stress inducers hydroxyurea (HU) and aphidicolin also activate this ATM-dependent signalling pathway. We further show that ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) interacts with NEMO but surprisingly does not cause NEMO phosphorylation. Consequently, ATR represses NF-kappaB activation induced by replication stress. Reduction or increase of ATR expression by RNA interference or overexpression increased or reduced ATM-NEMO association and NF-kappaB activation induced by HU. Apoptosis gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that HU and the DSB inducer etoposide caused complex patterns of NF-kappaB-dependent pro- and antiapoptotic gene expression with the overall outcome for the former being pro-apoptotic, whereas the latter antiapoptotic. Thus, replication stress and DSB inducers activate NF-kappaB through a conserved pathway with opposite biologic outcomes, and ATR antagonizes ATM function at least in part by competing for NEMO association."
19525225,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Multimeric nature of voltage-gated proton channels.,"Voltage-gated potassium channels are comprised of four subunits, and each subunit has a pore domain and a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). The four pore domains assemble to form one single central pore, and the four individual VSDs control the gate of the pore. Recently, a family of voltage-gated proton channels, such as H(V) or voltage sensor only protein (VSOP), was discovered that contain a single VSD but no pore domain. It has been assumed that VSOP channels are monomeric and contain a single VSD that functions as both the VSD and the pore domain. It remains unclear, however, how a protein that contains only a VSD and no pore domain can conduct ions. Using fluorescence measurements and immunoprecipitation techniques, we show here that VSOP channels are expressed as multimeric channels. Further, FRET experiments on constructs with covalently linked subunits show that VSOP channels are dimers. Truncation of the cytoplasmic regions of VSOP reduced the dimerization, suggesting that the dimerization is caused mainly by cytoplasmic protein-protein interactions. However, these N terminus- and C terminus-deleted channels displayed large proton currents. Therefore, we conclude that even though VSOP channels are expressed mainly as dimers in the cell membrane, single VSOP subunits could function independently as proton channels."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The FACT Spt16 &quot;peptidase&quot; domain is a histone H3-H4 binding module.,"The FACT complex is a conserved cofactor for RNA polymerase II elongation through nucleosomes. FACT bears histone chaperone activity and contributes to chromatin integrity. However, the molecular mechanisms behind FACT function remain elusive. Here we report biochemical, structural, and mutational analyses that identify the peptidase homology domain of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe FACT large subunit Spt16 (Spt16-N) as a binding module for histones H3 and H4. The 2.1-A crystal structure of Spt16-N reveals an aminopeptidase P fold whose enzymatic activity has been lost. Instead, the highly conserved fold directly binds histones H3-H4 through a tight interaction with their globular core domains, as well as with their N-terminal tails. Mutations within a conserved surface pocket in Spt16-N or posttranslational modification of the histone H4 tail reduce interaction in vitro, whereas the globular domains of H3-H4 and the H3 tail bind distinct Spt16-N surfaces. Our analysis suggests that the N-terminal domain of Spt16 may add to the known H2A-H2B chaperone activity of FACT by including a H3-H4 tail and H3-H4 core binding function mediated by the N terminus of Spt16. We suggest that these interactions may aid FACT-mediated nucleosome reorganization events."
19525350,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Systematic analysis of nucleation-dependent polymerization reveals new insights into the mechanism of amyloid self-assembly.,"Self-assembly of misfolded proteins into ordered fibrillar aggregates known as amyloid results in numerous human diseases. Despite an increasing number of proteins and peptide fragments being recognised as amyloidogenic, how these amyloid aggregates assemble remains unclear. In particular, the identity of the nucleating species, an ephemeral entity that defines the rate of fibril formation, remains a key outstanding question. Here, we propose a new strategy for analyzing the self-assembly of amyloid fibrils involving global analysis of a large number of reaction progress curves and the subsequent systematic testing and ranking of a large number of possible assembly mechanisms. Using this approach, we have characterized the mechanism of the nucleation-dependent formation of beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) amyloid fibrils. We show, by defining nucleation in the context of both structural and thermodynamic aspects, that a model involving a structural nucleus size approximately the size of a hexamer is consistent with the relatively small concentration dependence of the rate of fibril formation, contrary to expectations based on simpler theories of nucleated assembly. We also demonstrate that fibril fragmentation is the dominant secondary process that produces higher apparent cooperatively in fibril formation than predicted by nucleated assembly theories alone. The model developed is able to explain and predict the behavior of beta(2)m fibril formation and provides a rationale for explaining generic properties observed in other amyloid systems, such as fibril growth acceleration and pathway shifts under agitation."
19525400,0,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,7703701,2008,Association of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)-1B with c-Met receptor and modulation of corneal epithelial wound healing.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in epithelium during corneal wound healing and to investigate how PTPs regulate activation of the c-Met receptor and the receptor's proximal signaling. METHODS: Rabbit corneas were injured by gentle scraping of the surface, leaving the limbal epithelium intact, and epithelium was collected at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after injury. In organ culture models, epithelium was removed and corneas were incubated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), with or without the PTP inhibitor bpV(phen), and the PI-3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were stimulated with HGF with or without bpV(phen). Total cell lysates and cytosolic and membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blot. PTP activities were measured with specific substrates. PTP1B and SHP-2 genes were knocked down by interference RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: PTP activity and expression increased during wound healing. The most abundant were SHP-2, PTP1B, and PTEN. HGF activated the c-Met receptor in HCE cells up to 30 minutes and was downregulated by 2 hours. Inhibition of PTPs increased HGF-promoted wound healing, HGF-activated phosphorylation of c-Met, and its downstream signal PI-3K/Akt, but not ERK1/2 or p70S6K. PTP1B and SHP-2 were bound to the c-Met. Part of the c-Met was colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum with PTP1B. PTP1B phosphorylation increased when the c-Met receptor was deactivated, and gene knockdown of PTP1B increased c-Met activation. SHP-2 phosphorylation and binding to c-Met was higher during receptor activation, and SHP-2 gene silencing decreased receptor phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PTP activity mimics the effect of HGF by activating the PI-3K/Akt signal involved in wound healing. PTP1B and SHP-2 are bound to the c-Met receptor to control its activity. Although the binding of PTP1B increases when there is a decrease in c-Met activation and acts as a negative regulator of the receptor, the increased binding and phosphorylation of SHP-2 coincide with maximal stimulation of c-Met, acting as a positive regulator."
19525415,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,Heteromeric interactions among ethylene receptors mediate signaling in Arabidopsis.,"The gaseous hormone ethylene is perceived in Arabidopsis by a five member receptor family that consists of the subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and ERS1 and the subfamily 2 receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. Previous work has demonstrated that the basic functional unit for the ethylene receptor, ETR1, is a disulfide-linked homodimer. We demonstrate here that ethylene receptors isolated from Arabidopsis also interact with each other through noncovalent interactions. Evidence that ETR1 associates with other ethylene receptors was obtained by co-purification of ETR1 with tagged versions of ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 from Arabidopsis membrane extracts. ETR1 preferentially associated with the subfamily 2 receptors compared with the subfamily 1 receptor ERS1, but ethylene treatment affected the interactions and relative composition of the receptor complexes. When transgenically expressed in yeast, ETR1 and ERS2 can form disulfide-linked heterodimers. In plant extracts, however, the association of ETR1 and ERS2 can be largely disrupted by treatment with SDS, supporting a higher order noncovalent interaction between the receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that the receptor GAF domains are capable of mediating heteromeric receptor interactions. Kinetic analysis of ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 is consistent with their dominance being due in part to an ability to associate with other ethylene receptors. These data suggest that the ethylene receptors exist in plants as clusters in a manner potentially analogous to that found with the histidine kinase-linked chemoreceptors of bacteria and that interactions among receptors contribute to ethylene signal output."

We performed NMR analyses of Dronpa in solution at ambient temperatures to find structural flexibility of the protein in the dark state. Light-induced changes in interactions between the chromophore and beta-barrel are responsible for switching between the two states. In the bright state, the apex of the chromophore tethers to the barrel by a hydrogen bond, and an imidazole ring protruding from the barrel stabilizes the plane of the chromophore. These interactions are disrupted by strong illumination with blue light, and the chromophore, together with a part of the beta-barrel, becomes flexible, leading to a nonradiative decay process."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Communication between subunits critical to DNA binding by hexameric helicase of bacteriophage T7.,"The DNA helicase encoded by bacteriophage T7 consists of six identical subunits that form a ring through which the DNA passes. Binding of ssDNA is a prior step to translocation and unwinding of DNA by the helicase. Arg-493 is located at a conserved structural motif within the interior cavity of the helicase and plays an important role in DNA binding. Replacement of Arg-493 with lysine or histidine reduces the ability of the helicase to bind DNA, hydrolyze dTTP, and unwind dsDNA. In contrast, replacement of Arg-493 with glutamine abolishes these activities, suggesting that positive charge at the position is essential. Based on the crystallographic structure of the helicase, Asp-468 is in the range to form a hydrogen bonding with Arg-493 on the adjacent subunit. In vivo complementation results indicate that an interaction between Asp-468 and Arg-493 is critical for a functional helicase and those residues can be swapped without losing the helicase activity. This study suggests that hydrogen bonding between Arg-493 and Asp-468 from adjacent subunits is critical for DNA binding ability of the T7 hexameric helicase."
19525939,1,Structure,101087697,2008,Structural basis for the recognition of histone H4 by the histone-chaperone RbAp46.,"RbAp46 and RbAp48 (pRB-associated proteins p46 and p48, also known as RBBP7 and RBBP4, respectively) are highly homologous histone chaperones that play key roles in establishing and maintaining chromatin structure. We report here the crystal structure of human RbAp46 bound to histone H4. RbAp46 folds into a seven-bladed beta propeller structure and binds histone H4 in a groove formed between an N-terminal alpha helix and an extended loop inserted into blade six. Surprisingly, histone H4 adopts a different conformation when interacting with RbAp46 than it does in either the nucleosome or in the complex with ASF1, another histone chaperone. Our structural and biochemical results suggest that when a histone H3/H4 dimer (or tetramer) binds to RbAp46 or RbAp48, helix 1 of histone H4 unfolds to interact with the histone chaperone. We discuss the implications of our findings for the assembly and function of RbAp46 and RbAp48 complexes."

RPOTp plays an important role in chloroplast transcription, biogenesis, and mesophyll cell proliferation. RPOTmp fulfills a specific function in the transcription of the rrn operon in proplasts/amyloplasts during seed imbibition/germination and a more general function in chloroplasts during later developmental stages. In chloroplasts, RPOTmp is tightly associated with thylakoid membranes indicating that functional switching of RPOTmp is connected to thylakoid association. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified two proteins that interact with RPOTmp. The two proteins are very similar, both characterized by three N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal RING domain. We show that at least one of these proteins is an intrinsic thylakoid membrane protein that fixes RPOTmp on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, probably via the RING domain. A model is presented in which light by triggering the synthesis of the RING protein determines membrane association and functional switching of RPOTmp."
19525960,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Nuclear transit of the RNA-binding protein She2 is required for translational control of localized ASH1 mRNA.,"Cytoplasmic localization and localized translation of messenger RNAs contribute to asymmetrical protein distribution. Recognition of localized mRNAs by RNA-binding proteins can occur in the cytoplasm or, alternatively, co- or post-transcriptionally in the nucleus. In budding yeast, mRNAs destined for localization are bound by the She2 protein before their nuclear export. Here, we show that a specific transcript, known as ASH1 mRNA, and She2 localize specifically to the nucleolus when their nuclear export is blocked. Nucleolar She2 localization is enhanced in a She2 mutant that cannot bind to RNA. A fusion protein of the amino terminus of She3 and She2 (She3N-She2) fails to enter the nucleus, but does not impair ASH1 mRNA localization. Instead, these cells fail to distribute Ash1 protein asymmetrically, which is caused by a defective translational control of ASH1 mRNA. Our results indicate that the nucleolar transit of RNA-binding proteins such as She2 is necessary for the correct assembly of translationally silenced localizing messenger ribonucleoproteins."

Under normal conditions, the antiproliferative effects of p53 are inhibited by MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 is also self-ubiquitinated and degraded. Here, we show that the tumour suppressor RASSF1A regulates G(1)-S cell-cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner by promoting MDM2 self-ubiquitination and preventing p53 degradation. Importantly, RASSF1A associates with MDM2 and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX) in the nucleus, thereby disrupting the interactions between MDM2, DAXX, and the deubiquitinase, HAUSP, and enhancing the self-ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2. Moreover, RASSF1A partially contributes to p53-dependent checkpoint activation at early time points in response to DNA damage. These findings reveal a new and important function for RASSF1A in regulating the p53-MDM2 pathway."

Phosphorylation of both turn motif (TM) and hydrophobic motif (HM) are important for PKC function. Here, we show that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) has an important function in phosphorylation of both TM and HM in all conventional PKCs, novel PKCepsilon as well as Akt. Ablation of mTORC2 components (Rictor, Sin1 or mTOR) abolished phosphorylation on the TM of both PKCalpha and Akt and HM of Akt and decreased HM phosphorylation of PKCalpha. Interestingly, the mTORC2-dependent TM phosphorylation is essential for PKCalpha maturation, stability and signalling. Our study demonstrates that mTORC2 is involved in post-translational processing of PKC by facilitating TM and HM phosphorylation and reveals a novel function of mTORC2 in cellular regulation."

Whether TOR functions in this process as part of TORC2 remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that mTOR, SIN1 and rictor, components of mammalian (m)TORC2, are required for phosphorylation of Akt and conventional protein kinase C (PKC) at the turn motif (TM) site. This TORC2 function is growth factor independent and conserved from yeast to mammals. TM site phosphorylation facilitates carboxyl-terminal folding and stabilizes newly synthesized Akt and PKC by interacting with conserved basic residues in the kinase domain. Without TM site phosphorylation, Akt becomes protected by the molecular chaperone Hsp90 from ubiquitination-mediated proteasome degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that mTORC2 independently controls the Akt TM and HM sites in vivo and can directly phosphorylate both sites in vitro. Our studies uncover a novel function of the TOR pathway in regulating protein folding and stability, processes that are most likely linked to the functions of TOR in protein synthesis."

Large (more than approximately 40 kDa) transport cargoes imported into the nucleus typically form a complex with at least one soluble transport cofactor of the importin (Imp) beta superfamily. Many cargoes require an accessory cofactor, Imp alpha, which binds to Imp beta and to the nuclear localization sequence on the cargo. We previously reported the use of narrow-field epifluorescence microscopy to directly monitor cargoes in transit through NPCs in permeabilized cells. We now report an expanded approach in which single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is used to detect the disassembly of Imp alpha/cargo complexes as they transit through NPCs. We found that CAS, the recycling cofactor for Imp alpha, and RanGTP are essential for this dissociation process. After Imp alpha/cargo complex dissociation, most Imp alpha and cargo molecules entered the nucleoplasm. In contrast, the majority of Imp alpha/cargo complexes that did not dissociate at the NPC in the presence of CAS and RanGTP returned to the cytoplasm. These data are consistent with a model in which Imp alpha/cargo complexes are dissociated on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, and this dissociation requires both CAS and RanGTP."

Recent reports implicated Nedd4-1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN that regulates its stability and nuclear localization. We tested the physiological role of Nedd4-1 as a PTEN regulator by using cells and tissues derived from two independently generated strains of mice with their Nedd4-1 gene disrupted. PTEN stability and ubiquitination were indistinguishable between the wild-type and Nedd4-1-deficient cells, and an interaction between the two proteins could not be detected. Moreover, PTEN subcellular distribution, showing prominent cytoplasmic and nuclear staining, was independent of Nedd4-1 presence. Finally, activation of PKB/Akt, a major downstream target of cytoplasmic PTEN activity, and the ability of PTEN to transactivate the Rad51 promoter, a measure of its nuclear function, were unaffected by the loss of Nedd4-1. Taken together, our results fail to support a role for Nedd4-1 as the E3 ligase regulating PTEN stability and subcellular localization."

Aly is a nuclear speckle protein implicated in mRNA export. Here we show that Aly is a physiological target of nuclear PI3K signaling, which regulates its subnuclear residency, cell proliferation, and mRNA export activities through nuclear Akt phosphorylation and phosphoinositide association. Nuclear Akt phosphorylates Aly on threonine-219, which is required for its interaction with Akt. Aly binds phosphoinositides, and this action is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Phosphoinositide binding but not Akt phosphorylation dictates Aly's nuclear speckle residency. Depletion of Aly results in cell growth suppression and mRNA export reduction. Inhibition of Aly phosphorylation substantially decreases cell proliferation and mRNA export. Furthermore, disruption of phosphoinositide association with Aly also significantly reduces these activities. Thus, nuclear PI3K signaling mediates both cell proliferation and mRNA export functions of Aly."

In the present article, it is shown that production of the intact Azotobacter vinelandii [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic machinery at levels exceeding the amount required for cellular maturation of [Fe-S] proteins results in the accumulation of: (i) apo-IscU, (ii) an oxygen-labile [2Fe-2S] cluster-loaded form of IscU, and (iii) IscU complexed with the S-delivery protein, IscS. It is suggested that these species represent different stages of the [Fe-S] cluster assembly process. Substitution of the IscU Asp(39) residue by Ala results in the in vivo trapping of a stoichiometric, noncovalent, nondissociating IscU-IscS complex that contains an oxygen-resistant [Fe-S] species. In aggregate, these results validate the scaffold hypothesis for [Fe-S] cluster assembly and indicate that in vivo [Fe-S] cluster formation is a dynamic process that involves the reversible interaction of IscU and IscS."

Accordingly, a key determinant of disease onset and progression is the appropriate balance between Abeta production and clearance. Enzymes responsible for the degradation of Abeta are not well understood, and, thus far, it has not been possible to enhance Abeta catabolism by pharmacological manipulation. We provide evidence that Abeta catabolism is increased after inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and may constitute a viable therapeutic approach for lowering brain Abeta levels. PAI-1 inhibits the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an enzyme that cleaves plasminogen to generate plasmin, a protease that degrades Abeta oligomers and monomers. Because tPA, plasminogen and PAI-1 are expressed in the brain, we tested the hypothesis that inhibitors of PAI-1 will enhance the proteolytic clearance of brain Abeta. Our data demonstrate that PAI-1 inhibitors augment the activity of tPA and plasmin in hippocampus, significantly lower plasma and brain Abeta levels, restore long-term potentiation deficits in hippocampal slices from transgenic Abeta-producing mice, and reverse cognitive deficits in these mice."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Ion binding and selectivity of the rotor ring of the Na+-transporting V-ATPase.,"The vacuole-type ATPases (V-ATPases) are proton pumps in various intracellular compartments of eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic V-ATPase of Enterococcus hirae, closely related to the eukaryotic enzymes, provides a unique opportunity to study ion translocation by V-ATPases because it transports Na(+) ions, which are easier to detect by x-ray crystallography and radioisotope experiments. The purified rotor ring (K-ring) of the E. hirae V-ATPase binds one Na(+) ion per K-monomer with high affinity, which is competitively inhibited by Li(+) or H(+), suggesting that the K-ring can also bind these ions. This finding is also supported by the K-ring structure at 2.8 A in the presence of Li(+). Association and dissociation rates of the Na(+) to and from the purified K-ring were extremely slow compared with the Na(+) translocation rate estimated from the enzymatic activity, strongly suggesting that interaction with the stator subunit (I-subunit) is essential for Na(+) binding to /release from the K-ring."
19527648,0,Cell,413066,2008,Asymmetric homotypic interactions of the atypical cadherin flamingo mediate intercellular polarity signaling.,"Acquisition of planar cell polarity (PCP) in epithelia involves intercellular communication, during which cells align their polarity with that of their neighbors. The transmembrane proteins Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang) are essential components of the intercellular communication mechanism, as loss of either strongly perturbs the polarity of neighboring cells. How Fz and Vang communicate polarity information between neighboring cells is poorly understood. The atypical cadherin, Flamingo (Fmi), is implicated in this process, yet whether Fmi acts permissively as a scaffold or instructively as a signal is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Fmi functions instructively to mediate Fz-Vang intercellular signal relay, recruiting Fz and Vang to opposite sides of cell boundaries. We propose that two functional forms of Fmi, one of which is induced by and physically interacts with Fz, bind each other to create cadherin homodimers that signal bidirectionally and asymmetrically, instructing unequal responses in adjacent cell membranes to establish molecular asymmetry."

The MSP domain is named for its similarity to the C. elegans MSP protein, a sperm-derived hormone that binds to the Eph receptor and induces oocyte maturation. A point mutation (P56S) in the MSP domain of human VAPB is associated with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here we show that the MSP domains of VAP proteins are cleaved and secreted ligands for Eph receptors. The P58S mutation in VAP33 leads to a failure to secrete the MSP domain as well as ubiquitination, accumulation of inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum, and an unfolded protein response. We propose that VAP MSP domains are secreted and act as diffusible hormones for Eph receptors. This work provides insight into mechanisms that may impact the pathogenesis of ALS."
19527656,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Arabidopsis DREB2A-interacting proteins function as RING E3 ligases and negatively regulate plant drought stress-responsive gene expression.,"The DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) transcription factor controls water deficit-inducible gene expression and requires posttranslational modification for its activation. The activation mechanism is not well understood; however, the stability of this protein in the nucleus was recently found to be important for its activation. Here, we report the isolation of Arabidopsis thaliana DREB2A-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2, C3HC4 RING domain-containing proteins that interact with the DREB2A protein in the nucleus. An in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that they function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and are capable of mediating DREB2A ubiquitination. Overexpression of DRIP1 in Arabidopsis delayed the expression of DREB2A-regulated drought-responsive genes. Drought-inducible gene expression was slightly enhanced in the single T-DNA mutants of drip1-1 and drip2-1. By contrast, significantly enhanced gene expression was revealed in the drip1 drip2 double mutant under dehydration stress. Collectively, these data imply that DRIP1 and DRIP2 function negatively in the response of plants to drought stress. Moreover, overexpression of full-length DREB2A protein was more stable in drip1-1 than in the wild-type background. These results suggest that DRIP1 and DRIP2 act as novel negative regulators in drought-responsive gene expression by targeting DREB2A to 26S proteasome proteolysis."
19527667,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Arabidopsis DDB1-CUL4 ASSOCIATED FACTOR1 forms a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase with DDB1 and CUL4 that is involved in multiple plant developmental processes.,"The human DDB1-CUL4 ASSOCIATED FACTOR (DCAF) proteins have been reported to interact directly with UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1) through the WDxR motif in their WD40 domain and function as substrate-recognition receptors for CULLIN4-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we identified and characterized a homolog of human DCAF1/VprBP in Arabidopsis thaliana. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated the physical interaction between DCAF1 and DDB1 from Arabidopsis, which is likely mediated via the WD40 domain of DCAF1 that contains two WDxR motifs. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that DCAF1 associates with DDB1, RELATED TO UBIQUITIN-modified CUL4, and the COP9 signalosome in vivo but not with CULLIN-ASSOCIATED and NEDDYLATION-DISSOCIATED1, CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), or the COP10-DET1-DDB1 complex, supporting the existence of a distinct Arabidopsis CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, the CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 complex. Transient expression of fluorescently tagged DCAF1, DDB1, and CUL4 in onion epidermal cells showed their colocalization in the nucleus, consistent with the notion that the CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 complex functions as a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase. Genetic and phenotypic analysis of two T-DNA insertion mutants of DCAF1 showed that embryonic development of the dcaf1 homozygote is arrested at the globular stage, indicating that DCAF1 is essential for plant embryogenesis. Reducing the levels of DCAF1 leads to diverse developmental defects, implying that DCAF1 might be involved in multiple developmental pathways."

The UV-induced lesions on DNA affect both transcription and replication and can also have mutagenic consequences. Here we investigated the regulation and the function of the recently described CUL4-DDB1-DDB2 E3 ligase in the maintenance of genome integrity upon UV-stress using the model plant Arabidopsis. Physiological, biochemical, and genetic evidences indicate that this protein complex is involved in global genome repair (GGR) of UV-induced DNA lesions. Moreover, we provide evidences for crosstalks between GGR, the plant-specific photo reactivation pathway and the RAD1-RAD10 endonucleases upon UV exposure. Finally, we report that DDB2 degradation upon UV stress depends not only on CUL4, but also on the checkpoint protein kinase Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR). Interestingly, we found that DDB1A shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an ATR-dependent manner, highlighting an upstream level of control and a novel mechanism of regulation of this E3 ligase."

Some viruses express proteins homologous in sequence and function to mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins. Anti-apoptotic F1L expressed by vaccinia virus is essential for survival of infected cells, but it bears no discernable sequence homology to proteins other than its immediate orthologues in related pox viruses. Here we report that the crystal structure of F1L reveals a Bcl-2-like fold with an unusual N-terminal extension. The protein forms a novel domain-swapped dimer in which the alpha1 helix is the exchanged domain. Binding studies reveal an atypical BH3-binding profile, with sub-micromolar affinity only for the BH3 peptide of pro-apoptotic Bim and low micromolar affinity for the BH3 peptides of Bak and Bax. This binding interaction is sensitive to F1L mutations within the predicted canonical BH3-binding groove, suggesting parallels between how vaccinia virus F1L and myxoma virus M11L bind BH3 domains. Structural comparison of F1L with other Bcl-2 family members reveals a novel sequence signature that redefines the BH4 domain as a structural motif present in both pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, including viral Bcl-2-like proteins."

In Parkinson's disease it is believed that the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) from monomers by intermediates into amyloid fibrils is the toxic disease-causative mechanism. Here, we studied the structure of alpha-syn in its amyloid state by using various biophysical approaches. Quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange NMR spectroscopy identified five beta-strands within the fibril core comprising residues 35-96 and solid-state NMR data from amyloid fibrils comprising the fibril core residues 30-110 confirmed the presence of beta-sheet secondary structure. The data suggest that beta1-strand interacts with beta2, beta2 with beta3, beta3 with beta4, and beta4 with beta5. High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy revealed the protofilament boundaries of approximately 2 x 3.5 nm. Based on the combination of these data and published structural studies, a fold of alpha-syn in the fibrils is proposed and discussed."

Only Shs1 is nonessential. The four essential septins form a complex containing two copies of each, but their arrangement was not known. Single-particle analysis by EM confirmed that the heterooligomer is octameric and revealed that the subunits are arrayed in a linear rod. Identity of each subunit was determined by examining complexes lacking a given septin, by antibody decoration, and by fusion to marker proteins (GFP or maltose binding protein). The rod has the order Cdc11-Cdc12-Cdc3-Cdc10-Cdc10-Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11 and, hence, lacks polarity. At low ionic strength, rods assemble end-to-end to form filaments but not when Cdc11 is absent or its N terminus is altered. Filaments invariably pair into long parallel &quot;railroad tracks.&quot; Lateral association seems to be mediated by heterotetrameric coiled coils between the paired C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 projecting orthogonally from each filament. Shs1 may be able to replace Cdc11 at the end of the rod. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of cellular septin structures."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Regulation of NKCC2 by a chloride-sensing mechanism involving the WNK3 and SPAK kinases.,"The Na(+):K(+):2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) is the target of loop diuretics and is mutated in Bartter's syndrome, a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disease that impairs salt reabsorption in the kidney's thick ascending limb (TAL). Despite the importance of this cation/chloride cotransporter (CCC), the mechanisms that underlie its regulation are largely unknown. Here, we show that intracellular chloride depletion in Xenopus laevis oocytes, achieved by either coexpression of the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 or low-chloride hypotonic stress, activates NKCC2 by promoting the phosphorylation of three highly conserved threonines (96, 101, and 111) in the amino terminus. Elimination of these residues renders NKCC2 unresponsive to reductions of [Cl(-)](i). The chloride-sensitive activation of NKCC2 requires the interaction of two serine-threonine kinases, WNK3 (related to WNK1 and WNK4, genes mutated in a Mendelian form of hypertension) and SPAK (a Ste20-type kinase known to interact with and phosphorylate other CCCs). WNK3 is positioned upstream of SPAK and appears to be the chloride-sensitive kinase. Elimination of WNK3's unique SPAK-binding motif prevents its activation of NKCC2, as does the mutation of threonines 96, 101, and 111. A catalytically inactive WNK3 mutant also completely prevents NKCC2 activation by intracellular chloride depletion. Together these data reveal a chloride-sensing mechanism that regulates NKCC2 and provide insight into how increases in the level of intracellular chloride in TAL cells, as seen in certain pathological states, could drastically impair renal salt reabsorption."

Cullin-Associated and Neddylation-Dissociated (CAND1) modulates SCF function through its interactions with the CUL1 subunit. Although biochemical studies with human CAND1 suggested that CAND1 plays a negative regulatory role by sequestering CUL1 and preventing SCF complex assembly, genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that cand1 mutants exhibit reduced SCF activity, demonstrating that CAND1 is required for optimal SCF function in vivo. Together, these genetic and biochemical studies have suggested a model of CAND1-mediated cycles of SCF complex assembly and disassembly. Here, using the SCF(TIR1) complex of the Arabidopsis auxin response pathway, we test the SCF cycling model with Arabidopsis mutant derivatives of CAND1 and CUL1 that have opposing effects on the CAND1-CUL1 interaction. We find that the disruption of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction results in an increased abundance of assembled SCF(TIR1) complex. In contrast, stabilization of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction diminishes SCF(TIR1) complex abundance. The fact that both decreased and increased CAND1-CUL1 interactions result in reduced SCF(TIR1) activity in vivo strongly supports the hypothesis that CAND1-mediated cycling is required for optimal SCF function."

However, the mechanisms of modulation of DCs via ILT receptors remain poorly defined. HLA-G is a preferential ligand for several ILTs. Recently, we demonstrated that triggering of ILT4 by HLA-G1 inhibits maturation of human monocyte-derived conventional DCs and murine DCs from ILT4 transgenic mice, resulting in diminished expression of MHC class II molecules, CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules, and prolongation of skin allograft survival. Different isoforms of HLA-G have diverse effects on the efficiency to induce ILT-mediated signaling. In this work, we show that HLA-G1 tetrameric complex and HLA-G5 dimer, but not HLA-G5 monomer, induce strong ILT-mediated signaling. We determined that the arrest of maturation of ILT4-positive DCs by HLA-G ligands involves the IL-6 signaling pathway and STAT3 activation. Ligation of ILT4 with HLA-G on DCs results in recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein tyrosine phosphatases. We propose a model where SHP-2 and the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway play critical roles in the modulation of DC differentiation by ILT4 and HLA-G."
19528214,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The Coffin-Lowry syndrome-associated protein RSK2 is implicated in calcium-regulated exocytosis through the regulation of PLD1.,"Exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones occurs through the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. This highly regulated process involves key proteins, such as SNAREs, and specific lipids at the site of membrane fusion. Phospholipase D (PLD) has recently emerged as a promoter of membrane fusion in various exocytotic events potentially by providing fusogenic cone-shaped phosphatidic acid. We show here that PLD1 is regulated by ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2)-dependent phosphorylation. RSK2 is activated by a high K(+)-induced rise in cytosolic calcium. Expression of inactive RSK2 mutants or selective knockdown of endogenous RSK2 dramatically affects the different kinetic components of the exocytotic response in chromaffin cells. RSK2 physically interacts with and stimulates PLD activity through the phosphorylation of Thr-147 in the PLD1 amino-terminal phox homology domain. Expression of PLD1 phosphomimetic mutants fully restores secretion in cells depleted of RSK2, suggesting that RSK2 is a critical upstream signaling element in the activation of PLD1 to produce the lipids required for exocytosis. We propose that PLD-related defects in neuronal and endocrine activities could contribute to the effect observed after the loss-of-function mutations in Rsk2 that lead to Coffin-Lowry syndrome, an X-linked form of growth and mental retardation."
19528226,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Phospholipase D1 is an effector of Rheb in the mTOR pathway.,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) assembles a signaling network essential for the regulation of cell growth, which has emerged as a major target of anticancer therapies. The tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) proteins and their target, the small GTPase Rheb, constitute a key regulatory pathway upstream of mTOR. Phospholipase D (PLD) and its product phosphatidic acid are also upstream regulators of the mitogenic mTOR signaling. However, how the TSC/Rheb and PLD pathways interact or integrate in the rapamycin-sensitive signaling network has not been examined before. Here, we find that PLD1, but not PLD2, is required for Rheb activation of the mTOR pathway, as demonstrated by the effects of RNAi. The overexpression of Rheb activates PLD1 in cells in the absence of mitogenic stimulation, and the knockdown of Rheb impairs serum stimulation of PLD activation. Furthermore, the overexpression of TSC2 suppresses PLD1 activation, whereas the knockdown or deletion of TSC2 leads to elevated basal activity of PLD. Consistent with a TSC-Rheb-PLD signaling cascade, AMPK and PI3K, both established regulators of TSC2, appear to lie upstream of PLD as revealed by the effects of pharmacological inhibitors, and serum activation of PLD is also dependent on amino acid sufficiency. Finally, Rheb binds and activates PLD1 in vitro in a GTP-dependent manner, strongly suggesting that PLD1 is a bona fide effector for Rheb. Hence, our findings reveal an unexpected interaction between two cascades in the mTOR signaling pathways and open up additional possibilities for targeting this important growth-regulating network for the development of anticancer drugs."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Structure of coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase offers insight into corona and influenza virus evolution.,"The hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) are a family of viral envelope glycoproteins that mediate reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids by acting both as lectins and as receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). Related HEs occur in influenza C, toro-, and coronaviruses, apparently as a result of relatively recent lateral gene transfer events. Here, we report the crystal structure of a coronavirus (CoV) HE in complex with its receptor. We show that CoV HE arose from an influenza C-like HE fusion protein (HEF). In the process, HE was transformed from a trimer into a dimer, whereas remnants of the fusion domain were adapted to establish novel monomer-monomer contacts. Whereas the structural design of the RDE-acetylesterase domain remained unaltered, the HE receptor-binding domain underwent remodeling to such extent that the ligand is now bound in opposite orientation. This is surprising, because the architecture of the HEF site was preserved in influenza A HA over a much larger evolutionary distance, a switch in receptor specificity and extensive antigenic variation notwithstanding. Apparently, HA and HEF are under more stringent selective constraints than HE, limiting their exploration of alternative binding-site topologies. We attribute the plasticity of the CoV HE receptor-binding site to evolutionary flexibility conferred by functional redundancy between HE and its companion spike protein S. Our findings offer unique insights into the structural and functional consequences of independent protein evolution after interviral gene exchange and open potential avenues to broad-spectrum antiviral drug design."
19528258,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,A B-Myb complex containing clathrin and filamin is required for mitotic spindle function.,"B-Myb is one member of the vertebrate Myb family of transcription factors and is ubiquitously expressed. B-Myb activates transcription of a group of genes required for the G2/M cell cycle transition by forming the dREAM/Myb-MuvB-like complex, which was originally identified in Drosophila. Mutants of zebrafish B-myb and Drosophila myb exhibit defects in cell cycle progression and genome instability. Although the genome instability caused by a loss of B-Myb has been speculated to be due to abnormal cell cycle progression, the precise mechanism remains unknown. Here, we have purified a B-Myb complex containing clathrin and filamin (Myb-Clafi complex). This complex is required for normal localization of clathrin at the mitotic spindle, which was previously reported to stabilize kinetochore fibres. The Myb-Clafi complex is not tightly associated with the mitotic spindles, suggesting that this complex ferries clathrin to the mitotic spindles. Thus, identification of the Myb-Clafi complex reveals a previously unrecognized function of B-Myb that may contribute to its role in chromosome stability, possibly, tumour suppression."

The P(IB) group of P-type ATPases includes ATP-dependent pumps of Cu and other transition metal ions, and it is distinguished from other family members by the presence of N-terminal metal-binding domains (MBD). We have determined structures of two constructs of a Cu pump from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (CopA) by cryoelectron microscopy of tubular crystals, which reveal the overall architecture and domain organization of the molecule. By comparing these structures, we localized its N-terminal MBD within the cytoplasmic domains that use ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport cycle. We have built a pseudoatomic model by fitting existing crystallographic structures into the cryoelectron microscopy maps for CopA, which suggest a Cu-dependent regulatory role for the MBD."

This glycosyltransferase is unusual in that it is active only in the presence of a binding partner, Alg14. Alg13 is found to adopt a unique topology among glycosyltransferases. Rather than the conventional Rossmann fold found in all GT-B enzymes, the N-terminal half of the protein is a Rossmann-like fold with a mixed parallel and antiparallel beta sheet. The Rossmann fold of the C-terminal half of Alg13 is conserved. However, although conventional GT-B enzymes usually possess three helices at the C terminus, only two helices are present in Alg13. Titration of Alg13 with both UDP-GlcNAc, the native glycosyl donor, and a paramagnetic mimic, UDP-TEMPO, shows that the interaction of Alg13 with the sugar donor is primarily through the residues in the C-terminal half of the protein."

We previously demonstrated that only monomeric arrestin can bind the receptor and that the arrestin tetramer in solution differs from that in the crystal. We employed the Rosetta docking software to generate molecular models of the physiologically relevant solution tetramer based on the monomeric arrestin crystal structure. The resulting models were filtered using the Rosetta energy function, experimental intersubunit distances measured with DEER spectroscopy, and intersubunit contact sites identified by mutagenesis and site-directed spin labeling. This resulted in a unique model for subsequent evaluation. The validity of the model is strongly supported by model-directed crosslinking and targeted mutagenesis that yields arrestin variants deficient in self-association. The structure of the solution tetramer explains its inability to bind rhodopsin and paves the way for experimental studies of the physiological role of rod arrestin self-association."

The structure of coronatine is similar to that of a class of plant hormones called jasmonates (JAs). An important step in JA signaling is the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent degradation of JAZ repressor proteins. We have recently shown that jasmonoyl isoleucine (JA-Ile) promotes physical interaction between Arabidopsis JAZ1 and COI1 (the F-box component of SCF(COI1)) proteins, and that the JA-Ile-dependent COI1-JAZ1 interaction could be reconstituted in yeast cells (i.e. in the absence of other plant proteins). Here we show that coronatine, but not its two biosynthetic precursors, also promotes interaction between Arabidopsis COI1 and multiple JAZ proteins. The C-terminal Jas motif, but not the N-terminal (NT) domain or central ZIM domain of JAZ proteins, is critical for JA-Ile/coronatine-dependent interaction with COI1. Two positively charged amino acid residues in the Jas domain were identified as essential for coronatine-dependent COI1-JAZ interactions. Mutations of these two residues did not affect the ability of JAZ1 and JAZ9 to interact with the transcription factor AtMYC2. Importantly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing JAZ1 carrying these two mutations exhibited JA-insensitive phenotypes, including male sterility and enhanced resistance to P. syringae infection. These results not only suggest that coronatine and JA-Ile target the physical interaction between COI1 and the Jas domain of JAZ repressors, but also illustrate the critical role of positively charged amino acids in the Jas domain in mediating the JA-Ile/coronatine-dependent JAZ interaction with COI1."
19528638,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Bcl-XL inhibits membrane permeabilization by competing with Bax.,"Although Bcl-XL and Bax are structurally similar, activated Bax forms large oligomers that permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby committing cells to apoptosis, whereas Bcl-XL inhibits this process. Two different models of Bcl-XL function have been proposed. In one, Bcl-XL binds to an activator, thereby preventing Bax activation. In the other, Bcl-XL binds directly to activated Bax. It has been difficult to sort out which interaction is important in cells, as all three proteins are present simultaneously. We examined the mechanism of Bax activation by tBid and its inhibition by Bcl-XL using full-length recombinant proteins and measuring permeabilization of liposomes and mitochondria in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-XL and Bax are functionally similar. Neither protein bound to membranes alone. However, the addition of tBid recruited molar excesses of either protein to membranes, indicating that tBid activates both pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-XL competes with Bax for the activation of soluble, monomeric Bax through interaction with membranes, tBid, or t-Bid-activated Bax, thereby inhibiting Bax binding to membranes, oligomerization, and membrane permeabilization. Experiments in which individual interactions were abolished by mutagenesis indicate that both Bcl-XL-tBid and Bcl-XL-Bax binding contribute to the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-XL. By out-competing Bax for the interactions leading to membrane permeabilization, Bcl-XL ties up both tBid and Bax in nonproductive interactions and inhibits Bax binding to membranes. We propose that because Bcl-XL does not oligomerize it functions like a dominant-negative Bax in the membrane permeabilization process."

However, essentially all information on G protein regulation of GIRK electrophysiology has been gained on the basis of coexpression studies in heterologous systems. A major advantage of the model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, is the ease with which knockout mutants can be obtained. We evaluated plants harboring mutations in the sole Arabidopsis Galpha (AtGPA1), Gbeta (AGB1), and Regulator of G protein Signaling (AtRGS1) genes for impacts on ion channel regulation. In guard cells, where K(+) fluxes are integral to cellular regulation of stomatal apertures, inhibition of inward K(+) (K(in)) currents and stomatal opening by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) was equally impaired in Atgpa1 and agb1 single mutants and the Atgpa1 agb1 double mutant. AGB1 overexpressing lines maintained a wild-type phenotype. The Atrgs1 mutation did not affect K(in) current magnitude or ABA sensitivity, but K(in) voltage-activation kinetics were altered. Thus, Arabidopsis cells differ from mammalian cells in that they uniquely use the Galpha subunit or regulation of the heterotrimer to mediate K(in) channel modulation after ligand perception. In contrast, outwardly rectifying (K(out)) currents were unaltered in the mutants, and ABA activation of slow anion currents was conditionally disrupted in conjunction with cytosolic pH clamp. Our studies highlight unique aspects of ion channel regulation by heterotrimeric G proteins and relate these aspects to stomatal aperture control, a key determinant of plant biomass acquisition and drought tolerance."

Bves and GEFT are shown to colocalize in adult skeletal muscle. We also demonstrate that exogenous expression of Bves reduces Rac1 and Cdc42 activity levels while not affecting levels of active RhoA. Consistent with a repression of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, we show changes in speed of cell locomotion and cell roundness also result from exogenous expression of Bves. Modulation of Rho-family GTPase signaling by Bves would be highly consistent with previously described phenotypes occurring upon disruption of Bves function in a wide variety of model systems. Therefore, we propose Bves as a novel regulator of the Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling cascades."

Elongation factor (EF) 1A also associates to the MSC, with LeuRS possibly acting as a core protein. Analysis of the MSC revealed that LysRS and ProRS specifically interact with the idiosyncratic N- and C- termini of LeuRS, respectively. EF-1A instead interacts with the inserted CP1 proofreading domain, consistent with models for post-transfer editing by class I synthetases such as LeuRS. Together with previous genetic data, these findings show that LeuRS plays a central role in mediating interactions within the archaeal MSC by acting as a core scaffolding protein."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Calmodulin-dependent gating of Ca(v)1.2 calcium channels in the absence of Ca(v)beta subunits.,"It is generally accepted that to generate calcium currents in response to depolarization, Ca(v)1.2 calcium channels require association of the pore-forming alpha(1C) subunit with accessory Ca(v)beta and alpha(2)delta subunits. A single calmodulin (CaM) molecule is tethered to the C-terminal alpha(1C)-LA/IQ region and mediates Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel. Ca(v)beta subunits are stably associated with the alpha(1C)-interaction domain site of the cytoplasmic linker between internal repeats I and II and also interact dynamically, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with the alpha(1C)-IQ region. Here, we describe a surprising discovery that coexpression of exogenous CaM (CaM(ex)) with alpha(1C)/alpha(2)delta in COS1 cells in the absence of Ca(v)beta subunits stimulates the plasma membrane targeting of alpha(1C), facilitates calcium channel gating, and supports Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Neither real-time PCR with primers complementary to monkey Ca(v)beta subunits nor coimmunoprecipitation analysis with exogenous alpha(1C) revealed an induction of endogenous Ca(v)beta subunits that could be linked to the effect of CaM(ex). Coexpression of a calcium-insensitive CaM mutant CaM(1234) also facilitated gating of Ca(v)beta-free Ca(v)1.2 channels but did not support Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Our results show there is a functional matchup between CaM(ex) and Ca(v)beta subunits that, in the absence of Ca(v)beta, renders Ca2+ channel gating facilitated by CaM molecules other than the one tethered to LA/IQ to support Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Thus, coexpression of CaM(ex) creates conditions when the channel gating, voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation, and plasma-membrane targeting occur in the absence of Ca(v)beta. We suggest that CaM(ex) affects specific Ca(v)beta-free conformations of the channel that are not available to endogenous CaM."

Multipartite PY-NLSs are highly diverse in sequence and structure, share a common C-terminal R/H/KX2-5PY motif, and can be subdivided into hydrophobic and basic subclasses based on loose N-terminal sequence motifs. PY-NLS variability is consistent with weak consensus motifs, but such diversity potentially renders comprehensive genome-scale searches intractable. Here, we use yeast Kap104p as a model system to understand the energetic organization of this NLS. First, we show that Kap104p substrates contain PY-NLSs, demonstrating their generality across eukaryotes. Previously reported Kapbeta2-NLS structures explain Kap104p specificity for the basic PY-NLS. More importantly, thermodynamic analyses revealed physical properties that govern PY-NLS binding affinity: (1) PY-NLSs contain three energetically significant linear epitopes, (2) each epitope accommodates substantial sequence diversity, within defined limits, (3) the epitopes are energetically quasi-independent, and (4) a given linear epitope can contribute differently to total binding energy in different PY-NLSs, amplifying signal diversity through combinatorial mixing of energetically weak and strong motifs. The modular organization of the PY-NLS coupled with its combinatorial energetics lays a path to decode this diverse and evolvable signal for future comprehensive genome-scale identification of nuclear import substrates."
19530703,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Selective ligand recognition by a diversity-generating retroelement variable protein.,"Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) recognize novel ligands through massive protein sequence variation, a property shared uniquely with the adaptive immune response. Little is known about how recognition is achieved by DGR variable proteins. Here, we present the structure of the Bordetella bacteriophage DGR variable protein major tropism determinant (Mtd) bound to the receptor pertactin, revealing remarkable adaptability in the static binding sites of Mtd. Despite large dissimilarities in ligand binding mode, principles underlying selective recognition were strikingly conserved between Mtd and immunoreceptors. Central to this was the differential amplification of binding strengths by avidity (i.e., multivalency), which not only relaxed the demand for optimal complementarity between Mtd and pertactin but also enhanced distinctions among binding events to provide selectivity. A quantitatively similar balance between complementarity and avidity was observed for Bordetella bacteriophage DGR as occurs in the immune system, suggesting that variable repertoires operate under a narrow set of conditions to recognize novel ligands."
19530705,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,The DNA replication checkpoint aids survival of plants deficient in the novel replisome factor ETG1.,"Complete and accurate chromosomal DNA replication is essential for the maintenance of the genetic integrity of all organisms. Errors in replication are buffered by the activation of DNA stress checkpoints; however, in plants, the relative importance of a coordinated induction of DNA repair and cell cycle-arresting genes in the survival of replication mutants is unknown. In a systematic screen for Arabidopsis thaliana E2F target genes, the E2F TARGET GENE 1 (ETG1) was identified as a novel evolutionarily conserved replisome factor. ETG1 was associated with the minichromosome maintenance complex and was crucial for efficient DNA replication. Plants lacking the ETG1 gene had serrated leaves due to cell cycle inhibition triggered by the DNA replication checkpoints, as shown by the transcriptional induction of DNA stress checkpoint genes. The importance of checkpoint activation was highlighted by double mutant analysis: whereas etg1 mutant plants developed relatively normally, a synthetically lethal interaction was observed between etg1 and the checkpoint mutants wee1 and atr, demonstrating that activation of a G2 cell cycle checkpoint accounts for survival of ETG1-deficient plants."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Phosphorylation of MCM3 on Ser-112 regulates its incorporation into the MCM2-7 complex.,"During late M and early G(1), MCM2-7 assembles and is loaded onto chromatin in the final step of prereplicative complex (pre-RC) formation. However, the regulation of MCM assembly remains poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-dependent phosphorylation contributes to DNA replication by initially activating pre-RCs and subsequently inhibiting refiring of origins during S and M phases, thus limiting DNA replication to a single round. Although the precise roles of specific MCM phosphorylation events are poorly characterized, we now demonstrate that CDK1 phosphorylates MCM3 at Ser-112, Ser-611, and Thr-719. In vivo, CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-112 triggers the assembly of MCM3 with the remaining MCM subunits and subsequent chromatin loading of MCMs. Strikingly, loss of MCM3 triggers the destabilization of other MCM proteins, suggesting that phosphorylation-dependent assembly is essential for stable accumulation of MCM proteins. These data reveal that CDK-dependent MCM3 phosphorylation contributes to the regulated formation of the MCM2-7 complex."
19530722,0,BMC Cancer,100967800,2008,Vav3 oncogene activates estrogen receptor and its overexpression may be involved in human breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Our previous study revealed that Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in human prostate cancer, activates androgen receptor, and stimulates growth in prostate cancer cells. The current study is to determine a potential role of Vav3 oncogene in human breast cancer and impact on estrogen receptor a (ERalpha)-mediated signaling axis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in 43 breast cancer specimens and western blot analysis was used for human breast cancer cell lines to determine the expression level of Vav3 protein. The impact of Vav3 on breast cancer cell growth was determined by siRNA knockdown of Vav3 expression. The role of Vav3 in ERalpha activation was examined in luciferase reporter assays. Deletion mutation analysis of Vav3 protein was performed to localize the functional domain involved in ERalpha activation. Finally, the interaction of Vav3 and ERalpha was assessed by GST pull-down analysis. RESULTS: We found that Vav3 was overexpressed in 81% of human breast cancer specimens, particularly in poorly differentiated lesions. Vav3 activated ERalpha partially via PI3K-Akt signaling and stimulated growth of breast cancer cells. Vav3 also potentiated EGF activity for cell growth and ERalpha activation in breast cancer cells. More interestingly, we found that Vav3 complexed with ERalpha. Consistent with its function for AR, the DH domain of Vav3 was essential for ERalpha activation. CONCLUSION: Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in human breast cancer. Vav3 complexes with ERalpha and enhances ERalpha activity. These findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression may aberrantly enhance ERalpha-mediated signaling axis and play a role in breast cancer development and/or progression."
19530737,0,Mol. Cell Proteomics,101125647,2008,Investigation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B function by quantitative proteomics.,"Because of their antagonistic catalytic functions, protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and protein-tyrosine kinases act together to control phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling processes in mammalian cells. However, unlike for protein-tyrosine kinases, little is known about the cellular substrate specificity of many PTPs because of the lack of appropriate methods for the systematic and detailed analysis of cellular PTP function. Even for the most intensely studied, prototypic family member PTP1B many of its physiological functions cannot be explained by its known substrates. To gain better insights into cellular PTP1B function, we used quantitative MS to monitor alterations in the global tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts in comparison with their wild-type counterparts. In total, we quantified 124 proteins containing 301 phosphotyrosine sites under basal, epidermal growth factor-, or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated conditions. A subset of 18 proteins was found to harbor hyperphosphorylated phosphotyrosine sites in knock-out cells and was functionally linked to PTP1B. Among these proteins, regulators of cell motility and adhesion are overrepresented, such as cortactin, lipoma-preferred partner, ZO-1, or p120ctn. In addition, regulators of proliferation like p62DOK or p120RasGAP also showed increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Physical interactions of these proteins with PTP1B were further demonstrated by using phosphatase-inactive substrate-trapping mutants in a parallel MS-based analysis. Our results correlate well with the described phenotype of PTP1B-deficient fibroblasts that is characterized by an increase in motility and reduced cell proliferation. The presented study provides a broad overview about phosphotyrosine signaling processes in mouse fibroblasts and, supported by the identification of various new potential substrate proteins, indicates a central role of PTP1B within cellular signaling networks. Importantly the MS-based strategies described here are entirely generic and can be used to address the poorly understood aspects of cellular PTP function."

We detected a conformational change in CYP101 upon binding of Pdx that reorients bound camphor appropriately for hydroxylation. Experimental evidence shows that binding of Pdx converts a single X-proline amide bond in CYP101 from trans or distorted trans to cis. Mutation of proline 89 to isoleucine yields a mixture of both bound camphor orientations, that seen in Pdx-free and that seen in Pdx-bound CYP101. A mutation in CYP101 that destabilizes the cis conformer of the Ile 88-Pro 89 amide bond results in weaker binding of Pdx. This work provides direct experimental evidence for involvement of X-proline isomerization in enzyme function."
19531228,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Crucial structural role for the PH and C1 domains of the Vav1 exchange factor.,"The Vav family of proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho family of GTPases, which regulate various cellular functions, including T-cell activation. They contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain that is invariably followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is often required for catalytic activity. Vav proteins are the first GEFs for which an additional C1 domain is required for full biological activity. Here, we present the structure of a Vav1 fragment comprising the DH-PH-C1 domains bound to Rac1. This structure shows that the PH and C1 domains form a single structural unit that packs against the carboxy-terminal helix of the DH domain to stabilize its conformation and to promote nucleotide exchange. In contrast to previous reports, this structure shows that there are no direct contacts between the GTPase and C1 domain but instead suggests new mechanisms for the regulation of Vav1 activity."
19531232,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,"Identification of PCTA, a TGIF antagonist that promotes PML function in TGF-beta signalling.","The TGIF homoeodomain protein functions as an important negative regulator in the TGF-beta signalling pathway. The inhibitory function of TGIF is executed in part through its ability to sequester the tumour suppressor cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukaemia (cPML) in the nucleus, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of Smad2 by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Here, we report on the identification of PCTA (PML competitor for TGIF association), a TGIF antagonist that promotes TGF-beta-induced transcriptional and cytostatic responses. We provide evidence that PCTA functions in TGF-beta signalling by relieving the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation by TGIF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCTA selectively competes with cPML for TGIF association, resulting in the accumulation of cPML in the cytoplasm, where it associates with SARA and coordinates the access of Smad2 for phosphorylation by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Thus, our findings on the mode of action of PCTA provide new and important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the antagonistic interplay between TGIF and cPML in the TGF-beta signalling network."
19531241,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Sequential Cyk-4 binding to ECT2 and FIP3 regulates cleavage furrow ingression and abscission during cytokinesis.,"Cytokinesis is a highly regulated and dynamic event that involves the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and membrane compartments. Recently, FIP3 has been implicated in targeting of recycling endosomes to the mid-body of dividing cells and is found required for abscission. Here, we demonstrate that the centralspindlin component Cyk-4 is a FIP3-binding protein. Furthermore, we show that FIP3 binds to Cyk-4 at late telophase and that centralspindlin may be required for FIP3 recruitment to the mid-body. We have mapped the FIP3-binding region on Cyk-4 and show that it overlaps with the ECT2-binding domain. Finally, we demonstrate that FIP3 and ECT2 form mutually exclusive complexes with Cyk-4 and that dissociation of ECT2 from the mid-body at late telophase may be required for the recruitment of FIP3 and recycling endosomes to the cleavage furrow. Thus, we propose that centralspindlin complex not only regulates acto-myosin ring contraction but also endocytic vesicle transport to the cleavage furrow and it does so through sequential interactions with ECT2 and FIP3."
19531245,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Altered subcellular distribution of MSK1 induced by glucocorticoids contributes to NF-kappaB inhibition.,"Glucocorticoids are widely used anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, of which the action mechanism is mainly based on interference of hormone-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with the activity of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). In addition to the well described interaction-based mutual repression mechanism between the GR and NF-kappaB, additional mechanisms are at play, which help to explain the efficacy of glucocorticoid-mediated gene repression. In this respect, we found that glucocorticoids counteract the recruitment of activated Mitogen- and Stress-activated protein Kinase-1 (MSK1) at inflammatory gene promoters resulting in the inhibition of NF-kappaB p65 transactivation and of concurrent histone H3 phosphorylation. Additionally, we observed that activated GR can trigger redistribution of nuclear MSK1 to the cytoplasm through a CRM1-dependent export mechanism, as a result of an interaction between liganded GR and activated MSK1. These findings unveil a novel aspect within the GR-mediated NF-kappaB-targeting anti-inflammatory mechanism."
19531346,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,ALIX-CHMP4 interactions in the human ESCRT pathway.,"The ESCRT pathway facilitates membrane fission events during enveloped virus budding, multivesicular body formation, and cytokinesis. To promote HIV budding and cytokinesis, the ALIX protein must bind and recruit CHMP4 subunits of the ESCRT-III complex, which in turn participate in essential membrane remodeling functions. Here, we report that the Bro1 domain of ALIX binds specifically to C-terminal residues of the human CHMP4 proteins (CHMP4A-C). Crystal structures of the complexes reveal that the CHMP4 C-terminal peptides form amphipathic helices that bind across the conserved concave surface of ALIX(Bro1). ALIX-dependent HIV-1 budding is blocked by mutations in exposed ALIX(Bro1) residues that help contribute to the binding sites for three essential hydrophobic residues that are displayed on one side of the CHMP4 recognition helix (M/L/IxxLxxW). The homologous CHMP1-3 classes of ESCRT-III proteins also have C-terminal amphipathic helices, but, in those cases, the three hydrophobic residues are arrayed with L/I/MxxxLxxL spacing. Thus, the distinct patterns of hydrophobic residues provide a &quot;code&quot; that allows the different ESCRT-III subunits to bind different ESCRT pathway partners, with CHMP1-3 proteins binding MIT domain-containing proteins, such as VPS4 and Vta1/LIP5, and CHMP4 proteins binding Bro1 domain-containing proteins, such as ALIX."

Yet, the molecular mechanism by which NOD2 can stimulate IL-1beta secretion, and its biological significance were heretofore unknown. We found that NOD2 through its N-terminal caspase recruitment domain directly binds and activates caspase-1 to trigger IL-1beta processing and secretion in MDP-stimulated macrophages, whereas the C-terminal leucine-rich repeats of NOD2 prevent caspase-1 activation in nonstimulated cells. MDP challenge induces the association of NOD2 with another NLR protein, NALP1, and gel filtration analysis revealed the formation of a complex consisting of NOD2, NALP1, and caspase-1. Importantly, Bacillus anthracis infection induces IL-1beta secretion in a manner that depended on caspase-1 and NOD2. In vitro, Anthrax lethal toxin strongly potentiated IL-1beta secretion, and that response was NOD2 and caspase-1-dependent. Thus, NOD2 plays a key role in the B. anthracis-induced inflammatory response by being a critical mediator of IL-1beta secretion."
19531469,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Next generation of adeno-associated virus 2 vectors: point mutations in tyrosines lead to high-efficiency transduction at lower doses.,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors are in use in several Phase I/II clinical trials, but relatively large vector doses are needed to achieve therapeutic benefits. Large vector doses also trigger an immune response as a significant fraction of the vectors fails to traffic efficiently to the nucleus and is targeted for degradation by the host cell proteasome machinery. We have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK) signaling negatively affects transduction by AAV2 vectors by impairing nuclear transport of the vectors. We have also observed that EGFR-PTK can phosphorylate AAV2 capsids at tyrosine residues. Tyrosine-phosphorylated AAV2 vectors enter cells efficiently but fail to transduce effectively, in part because of ubiquitination of AAV capsids followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. We reasoned that mutations of the surface-exposed tyrosine residues might allow the vectors to evade phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and, thus, prevent proteasome-mediated degradation. Here, we document that site-directed mutagenesis of surface-exposed tyrosine residues leads to production of vectors that transduce HeLa cells approximately 10-fold more efficiently in vitro and murine hepatocytes nearly 30-fold more efficiently in vivo at a log lower vector dose. Therapeutic levels of human Factor IX (F.IX) are also produced at an approximately 10-fold reduced vector dose. The increased transduction efficiency of tyrosine-mutant vectors is due to lack of capsid ubiquitination and improved intracellular trafficking to the nucleus. These studies have led to the development of AAV vectors that are capable of high-efficiency transduction at lower doses, which has important implications in their use in human gene therapy."
19531470,0,Cell,413066,2008,The big brain aquaporin is required for endosome maturation and notch receptor trafficking.,"Activity of the big brain (bib) gene influences Notch signaling during Drosophila nervous system development. We demonstrate that Bib, which belongs to the aquaporin family of channel proteins, is required for endosome maturation in Drosophila epithelial cells. In the absence of Bib, early endosomes arrest and form abnormal clusters, and cells exhibit reduced acidification of endocytic trafficking organelles. Bib acts downstream of Hrs in early endosome morphogenesis and regulates biogenesis of endocytic compartments prior to the formation of Rab7-containing late endosomes. Abnormal endosome morphology caused by loss of Bib is accompanied by overaccumulation of Notch, Delta, and other signaling molecules as well as reduced intracellular trafficking of Notch to nuclei. Analysis of several endosomal trafficking mutants reveals a correlation between endosomal acidification and levels of Notch signaling. Our findings reveal an unprecedented role for an aquaporin in endosome maturation, trafficking, and acidification."

If we know the function of bacterial proteins we will be able to understand how these species have adapted to diverse environments including many extreme habitats. Here we present the protein interaction network for the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum which encodes 1,039 proteins, 726 (or 70%) of which interact via 3,649 interactions as revealed by systematic yeast two-hybrid screens. A high-confidence subset of 991 interactions links 576 proteins. To derive further biological insights from our data, we constructed an integrated network of proteins involved in DNA metabolism. Combining our data with additional evidences, we provide improved annotations for at least 18 proteins (including TP0004, TP0050, and TP0183 which are suggested to be involved in DNA metabolism). We estimate that this &quot;minimal&quot; bacterium contains on the order of 3,000 protein interactions. Profiles of functional interconnections indicate that bacterial proteins interact more promiscuously than eukaryotic proteins, reflecting the non-compartmentalized structure of the bacterial cell. Using our high-confidence interactions, we also predict 417,329 homologous interactions (&quot;interologs&quot;) for 372 completely sequenced genomes and provide evidence that at least one third of them can be experimentally confirmed."

However, the nuclear mediators of the actions of VEGF in ECs have not been fully defined. We show that VEGF induces the phosphorylation of three conserved serine residues in histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) via protein kinase D, which promotes nuclear export of HDAC7 and activation of VEGF-responsive genes in ECs. Expression of a signal-resistant HDAC7 mutant protein in ECs inhibits proliferation and migration in response to VEGF. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of HDAC7 serves as a molecular switch to mediate VEGF signaling and endothelial function."

In contrast, the voltage-gated proton channel (Hv) contains only a voltage-sensor domain, lacking a separate pore domain. The subunit stoichiometry and organization of Hv has been unknown. Here, we show that human Hv1 forms a dimer in the membrane and define regions that are close to the dimer interface by using cysteine cross-linking. Two dimeric interfaces appear to exist in Hv1, one mediated by S1 and the adjacent extracellular loop, and the other mediated by a putative intracellular coiled-coil domain. It may be significant that Hv1 uses for its dimer interface a surface that corresponds to the interface between the voltage sensor and pore in Kv channels."
19531496,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Involvement of estrogen-related receptors in transcriptional response to hypoxia and growth of solid tumors.,"The development of intratumoral hypoxia is a universal hallmark of rapidly growing solid tumors. Adaptation to the hypoxic environment, which is critical for tumor cell survival and growth, is mediated primarily through a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent transcriptional program. HIF activates genes that facilitate crucial adaptive mechanisms including increased glucose uptake and glycolysis and tumor angiogenesis, making it an important therapeutic target. However, the HIF-dependent transcriptional mechanism remains incompletely understood, and targeting HIF is a difficult endeavor. Here, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) physically interact with HIF and stimulate HIF-induced transcription. Importantly, ERRs appear to be essential for HIF's function. Transcriptional activation of hypoxic genes in cells cultured under hypoxia is largely blocked by suppression of ERRs through expression of a dominant negative form of ERR or treatment with a pharmacological ERR inhibitor, diethylstilbestrol. Systematic administration of diethylstilbestrol severely diminished growth and angiogenesis of tumor xenografts in vivo. Because nuclear receptors are outstanding targets for drug discovery, the findings not only may offer mechanistic insights into HIF-mediated transcription but also may open new avenues for targeting the HIF pathway for cancer therapy."
19531651,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,p53 stabilization in response to DNA damage requires Akt/PKB and DNA-PK.,"The p53 protein is one of the major tumor suppressor proteins. In response to DNA damage, p53 is prevented from degradation and accumulates to high levels. Ionizing radiation leads to hypophosphorylation of the p53 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 at sites where phosphorylation is critical for p53 degradation and to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt/PKB, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3. GSK-3, which normally phosphorylates Mdm2, is inactivated in response to ionizing radiation. We show that p53 accumulates in lymphoblasts from patients with the hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia in response to ionizing radiation despite the absence of a functional ATM kinase. Also, knockdown of ATR did not prevent p53 accumulation in response to ionizing radiation. Instead, p53 stabilization in response to ionizing radiation depended on the inactivation of GSK-3 and the presence of Akt/PKB. Akt/PKB is a target of DNA-PK, a kinase that is activated after ionizing radiation. Correspondingly, down-regulation of DNA-PK prevented phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and GSK-3 after ionizing radiation and strongly reduced the accumulation of p53. We therefore propose a signaling cascade for the regulation of p53 in response to ionizing radiation that involves activation of DNA-PK and Akt/PKB and inactivation of GSK-3 and Mdm2."

Here, we demonstrate that PDGF-induced activation of a PDGFRbeta mutated in Arg-385 or Glu-390 in D4 (the fourth Ig-like domain of the extracellular region) was compromised, resulting in impairment of a variety of PDGF-induced cellular responses. These experiments demonstrate that homotypic D4 interactions probably mediated by salt bridges between Arg-385 and Glu-390 play an important role in activation of PDGFRbeta and all type III receptor tyrosine kinases. We also used a chemical cross-linking agent to covalently cross-link PDGF-stimulated cells to demonstrate that a Glu390Ala mutant of PDGFRbeta undergoes typical PDGF-induced receptor dimerization. However, unlike WT PDGFR that is expressed on the surface of ligand-stimulated cells in an active state, PDGF-induced Glu390Ala dimers are inactive. Although the conserved amino acids that are required for mediating D4 homotypic interactions are crucial for PDGFRbeta activation, these interactions are dispensable for PDGFRbeta dimerization. Moreover, PDGFRbeta dimerization is necessary but not sufficient for tyrosine kinase activation."

However, this base modification does not alter the coding capacity, and its biological significance remains unclear. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana mRNA contains N6-methyladenosine at levels similar to those previously reported for animal cells. We further show that inactivation of the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and human mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA) results in failure of the developing embryo to progress past the globular stage. We also demonstrate that the arrested seeds are deficient in mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine. Expression of MTA is strongly associated with dividing tissues, particularly reproductive organs, shoot meristems, and emerging lateral roots. Finally, we show that MTA interacts in vitro and in vivo with At FIP37, a homolog of the Drosophila protein FEMALE LETHAL2D and of human WILMS' TUMOUR1-ASSOCIATING PROTEIN. The results reported here provide direct evidence for an essential function for N6-methyladenosine in a multicellular eukaryote, and the interaction with At FIP37 suggests possible RNA processing events that might be regulated or altered by this base modification."

Myoferlin is a membrane-anchored, multiple C2 domain-containing protein that is highly expressed in fusing myoblasts and required for efficient myoblast fusion to myotubes. We found that myoferlin binds directly to the eps15 homology domain protein, EHD2. Members of the EHD family have been previously implicated in endocytosis as well as endocytic recycling, a process where membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis are returned to the plasma membrane. EHD2 binds directly to the second C2 domain of myoferlin, and EHD2 is reduced in myoferlin null myoblasts. In contrast to normal myoblasts, myoferlin null myoblasts accumulate labeled transferrin and have delayed recycling. Introduction of dominant negative EHD2 into myoblasts leads to the sequestration of myoferlin and inhibition of myoblast fusion. The interaction of myoferlin with EHD2 identifies molecular overlap between the endocytic recycling pathway and the machinery that regulates myoblast membrane fusion."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Two-dimensional infrared spectra of isotopically diluted amyloid fibrils from Abeta40.,"The 2D IR spectra of the amide-I vibrations of amyloid fibrils from Abeta40 were obtained. The matured fibrils formed from strands having isotopic substitution by (13)C (18)O at Gly-38, Gly-33, Gly-29, or Ala-21 show vibrational exciton spectra having reduced dimensionality. Indeed, linear chain excitons of amide units are seen, for which the interamide vibrational coupling is measured in fibrils grown from 50% and 5% mixtures of labeled and unlabeled strands. The data prove that the 1D excitons are formed from parallel in-register sheets. The coupling constants show that for each of the indicated residues the amide carbonyls in the chains are separated by 0.5 +/- 0.05 nm. The isotope replacement of Gly-25 does not reveal linear excitons, consistent with the region of the strand having a different structure distribution. The vibrational frequencies of the amide-I modes, freed from effects of amide vibrational excitation exchange by 5% dilution experiments, point to there being a component of an electric field along the fibril axis that increases through the sequence Gly-38, Gly-33, Gly-29. The field is dominated by side chains of neighboring residues."

The bacterium uses an autotransporter protein UspA1 to target an important human cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the CEACAM1 receptor-binding region of UspA1 unusually consists of an extended, rod-like left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. Mutagenesis and binding studies of UspA1 and the N-domain of CEACAM1 have been used to delineate the interacting surfaces between ligand and receptor and guide assembly of the complex. However, solution scattering, molecular modelling and electron microscopy analyses all indicate that significant bending of the UspA1 coiled-coil stalk also occurs. This explains how UspA1 can engage CEACAM1 at a site far distant from its head group, permitting closer proximity of the respective cell surfaces during infection."
19534734,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,VE-statin/egfl7 regulates vascular elastogenesis by interacting with lysyl oxidases.,"We previously characterized VE-statin/egfl7, a protein that is exclusively secreted by endothelial cells and modulates smooth muscle cell migration. Here, we show that VE-statin/egfl7 is the first known natural negative regulator of vascular elastogenesis. Transgenic mice, expressing VE-statin/egfl7 under the control of keratin-14 promoter, showed an accumulation of VE-statin/egfl7 in arterial walls where its presence correlated with an impaired organization of elastic fibres. In vitro, fibroblasts cultured in the presence of VE-statin/egfl7 were unable to deposit elastic fibres due to a deficient conversion of soluble tropoelastin into insoluble mature elastin. VE-statin/egfl7 interacts with the catalytic domain of lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzymes and, in endothelial cells, endogenous VE-statin/egfl7 colocalizes with LoxL2 and inhibits elastic fibre deposition. In contrast, mature elastic fibres are abundantly deposited by endothelial cells that are prevented from producing endogenous VE-statin/egfl7. We propose a model where VE-statin/egfl7 produced by endothelial cells binds to the catalytic domains of enzymes of the LOX family in the vascular wall, thereby preventing the crosslink of tropoelastin molecules into mature elastin polymers and regulating vascular elastogenesis."
19534743,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Structural model of the circadian clock KaiB-KaiC complex and mechanism for modulation of KaiC phosphorylation.,"The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus can be reconstituted in vitro by the KaiA, KaiB and KaiC proteins in the presence of ATP. The principal clock component, KaiC, undergoes regular cycles between hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated states with a period of ca. 24 h that is temperature compensated. KaiA enhances KaiC phosphorylation and this enhancement is antagonized by KaiB. Throughout the cycle Kai proteins interact in a dynamic manner to form complexes of different composition. We present a three-dimensional model of the S. elongatus KaiB-KaiC complex based on X-ray crystallography, negative-stain and cryo-electron microscopy, native gel electrophoresis and modelling techniques. We provide experimental evidence that KaiB dimers interact with KaiC from the same side as KaiA and for a conformational rearrangement of the C-terminal regions of KaiC subunits. The enlarged central channel and thus KaiC subunit separation in the C-terminal ring of the hexamer is consistent with KaiC subunit exchange during the dephosphorylation phase. The proposed binding mode of KaiB explains the observation of simultaneous binding of KaiA and KaiB to KaiC, and provides insight into the mechanism of KaiB's antagonism of KaiA."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Transcription factor Ap2delta associates with Ash2l and ALR, a trithorax family histone methyltransferase, to activate Hoxc8 transcription.","The family of Ap2 transcription factors comprises five members with highly conserved DNA-binding domains. Among the family members, Ap2delta is the most divergent, because it lacks highly conserved residues within the transactivation domain (TAD) and has weak affinity for known Ap2 binding sites. To identify specific Ap2delta coactivators/regulators during development, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, using Ap2delta's TAD. We identified the trithorax superfamily member, Ash2l, as a binding partner that interacts exclusively with Ap2delta. We showed that Ash2l positively mediates Ap2delta transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Given the known role of Ash2l in histone modification, we determined whether Ap2delta was able to form a complex with that activity. Our results showed that Ap2delta associates with endogenous ASH2L and a member of the MLL family of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), MLL2 (ALR), forming a complex that methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). Additionally, we showed that Ap2delta is necessary for recruitment of Ash2l and Alr to the Hoxc8 locus and that recruitment of this complex leads to H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and subsequent gene activation. Altogether, we provide evidence of an association between a highly restricted gene-specific transcription factor and a Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax (SET)1/trithorax-like complex with H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Our studies also document a functional role for Ap2delta in recruiting histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to specific gene targets, such as Hoxc8. This role provides a mechanism through which these transcription factors can have diverse effects despite nearly identical DNA-binding motifs."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Structure of the membrane proximal oxidoreductase domain of human Steap3, the dominant ferrireductase of the erythroid transferrin cycle.","The daily production of 200 billion erythrocytes requires 20 mg of iron, accounting for nearly 80% of the iron demand in humans. Thus, erythroid precursor cells possess an efficient mechanism for iron uptake in which iron loaded transferrin (Tf) binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR) at the cell surface. The Tf:TfR complex then enters the endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon endosomal acidification, iron is released from Tf, reduced to Fe(2+) by Steap3, and transported across the endosomal membrane by divalent metal iron transporter 1. Steap3, the major ferrireductase in erythrocyte endosomes, is a member of a unique family of reductases. Steap3 is comprised of an N-terminal cytosolic oxidoreductase domain and a C-terminal heme-containing transmembrane domain. Cytosolic NADPH and a flavin are predicted cofactors, but the NADPH/flavin binding domain differs significantly from those in other eukaryotic reductases. Instead, Steap3 shows remarkable, although limited homology to FNO, an archaeal oxidoreductase. We have determined the crystal structure of the human Steap3 oxidoreductase domain in the absence and presence of NADPH. The structure reveals an FNO-like domain with an unexpected dimer interface and substrate binding sites that are well positioned to direct electron transfer from the cytosol to a heme moiety predicted to be fixed within the transmembrane domain. Here, we discuss possible gating mechanisms for electron transfer across the endosomal membrane."
19535574,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Raf activation is regulated by tyrosine 510 phosphorylation in Drosophila.,"The proto-oncoprotein Raf is pivotal for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and its aberrant activation has been implicated in multiple human cancers. However, the precise molecular mechanism of Raf activation, especially for B-Raf, remains unresolved. By genetic and biochemical studies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 510 is essential for activation of Drosophila Raf (Draf), which is an ortholog of mammalian B-Raf. Y510 of Draf is phosphorylated by the c-src homolog Src64B. Acidic substitution of Y510 promotes and phenylalanine substitution impairs Draf activation without affecting its enzymatic activity, suggesting that Y510 plays a purely regulatory role. We further show that Y510 regulates Draf activation by affecting the autoinhibitory interaction between the N- and C-terminal fragments of the protein. Finally, we show that Src64B is required for Draf activation in several developmental processes. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of Raf activation via Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Since Y510 is a conserved residue in the kinase domain of all Raf proteins, this mechanism is likely evolutionarily conserved."
19535597,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,An exocyst complex functions in plant cell growth in Arabidopsis and tobacco.,"The exocyst, an octameric tethering complex and effector of Rho and Rab GTPases, facilitates polarized secretion in yeast and animals. Recent evidence implicates three plant homologs of exocyst subunits (SEC3, SEC8, and EXO70A1) in plant cell morphogenesis. Here, we provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that these and other predicted subunits function together in vivo in Arabidopsis thaliana. Double mutants in exocyst subunits (sec5 exo70A1 and sec8 exo70A1) show a synergistic defect in etiolated hypocotyl elongation. Mutants in exocyst subunits SEC5, SEC6, SEC8, and SEC15a show defective pollen germination and pollen tube growth phenotypes. Using antibodies directed against SEC6, SEC8, and EXO70A1, we demonstrate colocalization of these proteins at the apex of growing tobacco pollen tubes. The SEC3, SEC5, SEC6, SEC8, SEC10, SEC15a, and EXO70 subunits copurify in a high molecular mass fraction of 900 kD after chromatographic fractionation of an Arabidopsis cell suspension extract. Blue native electrophoresis confirmed the presence of SEC3, SEC6, SEC8, and EXO70 in high molecular mass complexes. Finally, use of the yeast two-hybrid system revealed interaction of Arabidopsis SEC3a with EXO70A1, SEC10 with SEC15b, and SEC6 with SEC8. We conclude that the exocyst functions as a complex in plant cells, where it plays important roles in morphogenesis."
19535624,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Factor VIII accelerates proteolytic cleavage of von Willebrand factor by ADAMTS13.,"Proteolytic processing of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase is crucial for normal hemostasis. In vitro, cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 is slow even at high shear stress and is typically studied in the presence of denaturants. We now show that, under shear stress and at physiological pH and ionic strength, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) accelerates, by a factor of approximately 10, the rate of specific cleavage at the Tyr(1605)-Met(1606) bond in VWF. Multimer analysis reveals that FVIII preferentially accelerates the cleavage of high-molecular-weight multimers. This rate enhancement is not observed with VWF predenatured with 1.5 M guanidine. The ability of FVIII to enhance VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 is rapidly lost after pretreatment of FVIII with thrombin. A FVIII derivative lacking most of the B domain behaves equivalently to full-length FVIII. In contrast, a derivative lacking both the B domain and the acidic region a3 that contributes to the high-affinity interaction of FVIII with VWF exhibits a greatly reduced ability to enhance VWF cleavage. Our data suggest that FVIII plays a role in regulating proteolytic processing of VWF by ADAMTS13 under shear stress, which depends on the high-affinity interaction between FVIII and its carrier protein, VWF."

TRPV1 functions as a molecular integrator of noxious stimuli, including heat, low pH, and chemical ligands. Here, we report the 3D structure of full-length rat TRPV1 channel expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. We demonstrate that the recombinant purified TRPV1 channel retains its structural and functional integrity and is suitable for structural analysis. The 19-A structure of TRPV1 determined by using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy exhibits fourfold symmetry and comprises two distinct regions: a large open basket-like domain, likely corresponding to the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal portions, and a more compact domain, corresponding to the transmembrane portion. The assignment of transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions was supported by fitting crystal structures of the structurally homologous Kv1.2 channel and isolated TRPV1 ankyrin repeats into the TRPV1 structure."

Actin-specific ADPRTs (including Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin) ADP-ribosylate G-actin at Arg-177, leading to disorganization of the cytoskeleton and cell death. Although the structures of many actin-specific ADPRTs are available, the mechanisms underlying actin recognition and selective ADP-ribosylation of Arg-177 remain unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of actin-Ia in complex with the nonhydrolyzable NAD analog betaTAD at 2.8 A resolution. The structure indicates that Ia recognizes actin via five loops around NAD: loop I (Tyr-60-Tyr-62 in the N domain), loop II (active-site loop), loop III, loop IV (PN loop), and loop V (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn loop). We used site-directed mutagenesis to confirm that loop I on the N domain and loop II are essential for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Furthermore, we revealed that Glu-378 on the EXE loop is in close proximity to Arg-177 in actin, and we proposed that the ADP-ribosylation of Arg-177 proceeds by an SN1 reaction via first an oxocarbenium ion intermediate and second a cationic intermediate by alleviating the strained conformation of the first oxocarbenium ion. Our results suggest a common reaction mechanism for ADPRTs. Moreover, the structure might be of use in rational drug design to block toxin-substrate recognition."

The interactions between PBEF and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1(ND1), ferritin light chain and interferon induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) in human pulmonary vascular endothelial cells were identified and validated. ND1, ferritin and IFITM3 are involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. Overexpression of PBEF increased its interactions and intracellular oxidative stress, which can be attenuated by rotenone. The interaction modeling between PBEF and ND1 is consistent with the corresponding experimental finding. These interactions may underlie a novel role of PBEF in the pathogenesis of ALI."

We previously showed that GzmA acts directly on mitochondria to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupt the transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) but does not permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondrial damage is critical to GzmA-induced cell death since cells treated with superoxide scavengers are resistant to GzmA. Here we find that GzmA accesses the mitochondrial matrix to cleave the complex I protein NDUFS3, an iron-sulfur subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I, after Lys56 to interfere with NADH oxidation and generate superoxide anions. Target cells expressing a cleavage site mutant of NDUFS3 are resistant to GzmA-mediated cell death but remain sensitive to GzmB."

It stimulates transcription elongation by phosphorylation of serine 2 residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of polymerase II. 7SK RNA and HEXIM proteins can antagonize transcriptional stimulation by sequestering P-TEFb in a catalytically inactive ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized La-related protein 7 (LARP7) has a role in 7SK-mediated regulation of transcription. LARP7 binds to the highly conserved 3'-terminal U-rich stretch of 7SK RNA and is an integral part of the 7SK RNP. On stimulation, LARP7 remains associated with 7SK RNA, whereas P-TEFb is released. Interestingly, reduction of LARP7 by RNA interference enhances transcription from cellular polymerase II promoters, as well as a TAT-dependent HIV-1 promoter. Thus, LARP7 is a negative transcriptional regulator of polymerase II genes, acting by means of the 7SK RNP system."

Despite their prevalence in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, important details of the structure of amyloid fibrils remain unknown. Here, we present a three-dimensional structure of a mature amyloid fibril formed by Abeta(1-40) peptide, determined by electron cryomicroscopy at approximately 8-A resolution. The fibril consists of two protofilaments, each containing approximately 5-nm-long regions of beta-sheet structure. A local twofold symmetry within each region suggests that pairs of beta-sheets are formed from equivalent parts of two Abeta(1-40) peptides contained in each protofilament. The pairing occurs via tightly packed interfaces, reminiscent of recently reported steric zipper structures. However, unlike these previous structures, the beta-sheet pairing is observed within an amyloid fibril and includes significantly longer amino acid sequences."

Here, we describe the 2.1 A resolution structure of crystals containing overlapping tropomyosin N and C termini (TM-N and TM-C) and the 2.9 A resolution structure of crystals containing TM-N and TM-C together with a fragment of troponin-T (TnT). At each junction, the N-terminal helices of TM-N were splayed, with only one of them packing against TM-C. In the C-terminal region of TM-C, a crucial water in the coiled-coil core broke the local 2-fold symmetry and helps generate a kink on one helix. In the presence of a TnT fragment, the asymmetry in TM-C facilitates formation of a 4-helix bundle containing two TM-C chains and one chain each of TM-N and TnT. Mutating the residues that generate the asymmetry in TM-C caused a marked decrease in the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin filaments. The highly conserved region of TnT, in which most cardiomyopathy mutations reside, is crucial for interacting with tropomyosin. The structure of the ternary complex also explains why the skeletal- and cardiac-muscle specific C-terminal region is required to bind TnT and why tropomyosin homodimers bind only a single TnT. On actin filaments, the head-to-tail junction can function as a molecular swivel to accommodate irregularities in the coiled-coil path between successive tropomyosins enabling each to interact equivalently with the actin helix."

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), consisting of catalytic alpha subunit and regulatory subunits beta and gamma, has a pivotal function in energy homoeostasis. We show here that AMPK protein levels and enzymatic activity were significantly increased in the brown adipose tissue of Cidea(-/-) mice. We also found that Cidea is colocalized with AMPK in the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a complex with AMPK in vivo through specific interaction with the beta subunit of AMPK, but not with the alpha or gamma subunit. When co-expressed with Cidea, the stability of AMPK-beta subunit was dramatically reduced due to increased ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which depends on a physical interaction between Cidea and AMPK. Furthermore, AMPK stability and enzymatic activity were increased in Cidea(-/-) adipocytes differentiated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts or preadipocytes. Our data strongly suggest that AMPK can be regulated by Cidea-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteosome degradation, and provide a molecular explanation for the increased energy expenditure and lean phenotype in Cidea-null mice."

Here we characterized two genetically modified animal models to test separate but related questions about the effects that retromer deficiency has on the brain. First, testing for cognitive defects, we investigated retromer-deficient mice and found that they develop hippocampal-dependent memory and synaptic dysfunction, which was associated with elevations in endogenous Abeta peptide. Second, testing for neurodegeneration and amyloid deposits, we investigated retromer-deficient flies expressing human wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and found that they develop neuronal loss and human Abeta aggregates. By recapitulating features of the disease, these animal models suggest that retromer deficiency observed in late-onset Alzheimer's disease can contribute to disease pathogenesis."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Chaperone-dependent amyloid assembly protects cells from prion toxicity.,"Protein conformational diseases are associated with the aberrant accumulation of amyloid protein aggregates, but whether amyloid formation is cytotoxic or protective is unclear. To address this issue, we investigated a normally benign amyloid formed by the yeast prion [RNQ(+)]. Surprisingly, modest overexpression of Rnq1 protein was deadly, but only when preexisting Rnq1 was in the [RNQ(+)] prion conformation. Molecular chaperones protect against protein aggregation diseases and are generally believed to do so by solubilizing their substrates. The Hsp40 chaperone, Sis1, suppressed Rnq1 proteotoxicity, but instead of blocking Rnq1 protein aggregation, it stimulated conversion of soluble Rnq1 to [RNQ(+)] amyloid. Furthermore, interference with Sis1-mediated [RNQ(+)] amyloid formation exacerbated Rnq1 toxicity. These and other data establish that even subtle changes in the folding homeostasis of an amyloidogenic protein can create a severe proteotoxic gain-of-function phenotype and that chaperone-mediated amyloid assembly can be cytoprotective. The possible relevance of these findings to other phenomena, including prion-driven neurodegenerative diseases and heterokaryon incompatibility in fungi, is discussed."
19537799,0,BMC Genomics,100965258,2008,Arabidopsis mRNA polyadenylation machinery: comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interactions and gene expression profiling.,"BACKGROUND: The polyadenylation of mRNA is one of the critical processing steps during expression of almost all eukaryotic genes. It is tightly integrated with transcription, particularly its termination, as well as other RNA processing events, i.e. capping and splicing. The poly(A) tail protects the mRNA from unregulated degradation, and it is required for nuclear export and translation initiation. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that the polyadenylation process is also involved in the regulation of gene expression. The polyadenylation process requires two components, the cis-elements on the mRNA and a group of protein factors that recognize the cis-elements and produce the poly(A) tail. Here we report a comprehensive pairwise protein-protein interaction mapping and gene expression profiling of the mRNA polyadenylation protein machinery in Arabidopsis. RESULTS: By protein sequence homology search using human and yeast polyadenylation factors, we identified 28 proteins that may be components of Arabidopsis polyadenylation machinery. To elucidate the protein network and their functions, we first tested their protein-protein interaction profiles. Out of 320 pair-wise protein-protein interaction assays done using the yeast two-hybrid system, 56 (approximately 17%) showed positive interactions. 15 of these interactions were further tested, and all were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and/or in vitro co-purification. These interactions organize into three distinct hubs involving the Arabidopsis polyadenylation factors. These hubs are centered around AtCPSF100, AtCLPS, and AtFIPS. The first two are similar to complexes seen in mammals, while the third one stands out as unique to plants. When comparing the gene expression profiles extracted from publicly available microarray datasets, some of the polyadenylation related genes showed tissue-specific expression, suggestive of potential different polyadenylation complex configurations. CONCLUSION: An extensive protein network was revealed for plant polyadenylation machinery, in which all predicted proteins were found to be connecting to the complex. The gene expression profiles are indicative that specialized sub-complexes may be formed to carry out targeted processing of mRNA in different developmental stages and tissue types. These results offer a roadmap for further functional characterizations of the protein factors, and for building models when testing the genetic contributions of these genes in plant growth and development."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,EB1 promotes Aurora-B kinase activity through blocking its inactivation by protein phosphatase 2A.,"EB1 (end-binding protein 1) is a key player in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. In concert with its binding partners, adenomatous polyposis coli and p150(glued), EB1 plays a crucial role in a variety of microtubule-based cellular processes. In this study we have identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen the mitotic kinase and chromosome passenger protein Aurora-B as a binding partner of EB1. GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal a specific interaction between Aurora-B and EB1 both in cells and in vitro. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that these two proteins colocalize on the central spindle in anaphase and in the midbody during cytokinesis. Kinase assays using both immunoprecipitated and purified Aurora-B demonstrate that EB1 is not a substrate of Aurora-B. Rather, EB1 positively regulates Aurora-B kinase activity. EB1 overexpression remarkably enhances Aurora-B activity and knockdown of its expression impairs Aurora-B activity. Our data further show that EB1 is able to protect Aurora-B from dephosphorylation/inactivation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by blocking PP2A binding to Aurora-B. These findings establish Aurora-B as an EB1-interacting protein and suggest that EB1 stimulates Aurora-B activity through antagonizing its dephosphorylation/inactivation by PP2A."

These proteins assemble as a pentamer with identical ACh binding sites at the subunit interfaces and show ligand specificities resembling those of the nicotinic receptor for agonists and antagonists. A subset of ligands, termed the neonicotinoids, exhibit specificity for insect nicotinic receptors and selective toxicity as insecticides. AChBPs are of neither mammalian nor insect origin and exhibit a distinctive pattern of selectivity for the neonicotinoid ligands. We define here the binding orientation and determinants of differential molecular recognition for the neonicotinoids and classical nicotinoids by estimates of kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters and crystallographic analysis. Neonicotinoid complex formation is rapid and accompanied by quenching of the AChBP tryptophan fluorescence. Comparisons of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiacloprid in the binding site from Aplysia californica AChBP at 2.48 and 1.94 A in resolution reveal a single conformation of the bound ligands with four of the five sites occupied in the pentameric crystal structure. The neonicotinoid electronegative pharmacophore is nestled in an inverted direction compared with the nicotinoid cationic functionality at the subunit interfacial binding pocket. Characteristic of several agonists, loop C largely envelops the ligand, positioning aromatic side chains to interact optimally with conjugated and hydrophobic regions of the neonicotinoid. This template defines the association of interacting amino acids and their energetic contributions to the distinctive interactions of neonicotinoids."

We describe an approach to classify estrogen receptor (ER) modulators based on dynamics of the receptor-ligand complex as probed with hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry. Differential HDX mapping coupled with cluster and discriminate analysis effectively predicted tissue-selective function in most, but not all, cases tested. We demonstrate that analysis of dynamics of the receptor-ligand complex facilitates binning of ER modulators into distinct groups based on structural dynamics. Importantly, we were able to differentiate small structural changes within ER ligands of the same chemotype. In addition, HDX revealed differentially stabilized regions within the ligand-binding pocket that may contribute to the different pharmacology phenotypes of the compounds independent of helix 12 positioning. In summary, HDX provides a sensitive and rapid approach to classify modulators of the estrogen receptor that correlates with their pharmacological profile."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Fecal transmission of AA amyloidosis in the cheetah contributes to high incidence of disease.,"AA amyloidosis is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), which are in danger of extinction, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Given the transmissible characteristics of AA amyloidosis, transmission between captive cheetahs may be a possible mechanism involved in the high incidence of AA amyloidosis. In this study of animals with AA amyloidosis, we found that cheetah feces contained AA amyloid fibrils that were different from those of the liver with regard to molecular weight and shape and had greater transmissibility. The infectious activity of fecal AA amyloid fibrils was reduced or abolished by the protein denaturants 6 M guanidine.HCl and formic acid or by AA immunodepletion. Thus, we propose that feces are a vehicle of transmission that may accelerate AA amyloidosis in captive cheetah populations. These results provide a pathogenesis for AA amyloidosis and suggest possible measures for rescuing cheetahs from extinction."

We have performed a genome-wide in vivo screen for protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA). We identified 2770 interactions among 1124 endogenously expressed proteins. Comparison with previous studies confirmed known interactions, but most were not known, revealing a previously unexplored subspace of the yeast protein interactome. The PCA detected structural and topological relationships between proteins, providing an 8-nanometer-resolution map of dynamically interacting complexes in vivo and extended networks that provide insights into fundamental cellular processes, including cell polarization and autophagy, pathways that are evolutionarily conserved and central to both development and human health."

However, the links between adaptations to conditions associated with protein misfolding and resistance to the time-dependent attrition of cellular function remain poorly understood. We report that worms lacking aip-1, a homologue of mammalian AIRAP (arsenic-inducible proteasomal 19S regulatory particle-associated protein), are not only impaired in their ability to resist exposure to arsenite but also exhibit shortened lifespan and hypersensitivity to misfolding-prone proteins under normal laboratory conditions. Mammals have a second, constitutively expressed AIRAP-like gene (AIRAPL) that also encodes a proteasome-interacting protein, which shares with AIRAP the property of enhancing peptide accessibility to the proteasome's active site. Genetic rescue experiments suggest that features common to the constitutively expressed worm AIP-1 and mammalian AIRAPL (but missing in the smaller, arsenite-inducible AIRAP) are important to lifespan extension. In worms, a single AIRAP-related protein links proteasomal adaptation to environmental stress with resistance to both proteotoxic insults and maintenance of animal life span under normal conditions."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Modulation of brassinosteroid-regulated gene expression by Jumonji domain-containing proteins ELF6 and REF6 in Arabidopsis.,"Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), are of great importance for plant growth and development. BRs signal through a cell surface receptor kinase, BRI1, and a GSK3-like kinase, BIN2, to regulate the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors, which directly bind to target gene promoters to activate or repress gene expression and mediate BR responses. To understand how BES1 regulates target gene expression, we identified two BES1-interacting proteins, ELF6 (early flowering 6) and its homolog REF6 (relative of early flowering 6), both of which are Jumonji N/C (JmjN/C) domain-containing proteins and were previously found to regulate flowering time. The interactions between BES1 and ELF6/REF6 were confirmed by GST pull-down and BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) experiments. Mutations in ELF6 or REF6 genes in Arabidopsis lead to BR-related phenotypes, including impaired cell elongation and reduced expression of BR target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicated that histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation status was changed in elf6 and ref6 mutants, consistent with recent findings that many Jmj proteins are histone demethylases. Our results demonstrate that BES1 recruits other transcriptional regulators such as ELF6 and REF6 to regulate target gene expression and coordinate BR responses with other developmental processes such as control of flowering time. Jmj domain-containing histone demethylases are involved in gene expression in many developmental processes and diseases, but how these proteins affect specific pathways is not well understood. Thus, our study establishes an important mechanism by which Jmj domain proteins modulate specific gene expression by interacting with pathway-specific transcription factors such as BES1."
19541911,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2008,Functional analysis of a predicted flavonol synthase gene family in Arabidopsis.,"The genome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains five sequences with high similarity to FLAVONOL SYNTHASE1 (AtFLS1), a previously characterized flavonol synthase gene that plays a central role in flavonoid metabolism. This apparent redundancy suggests the possibility that Arabidopsis uses multiple isoforms of FLS with different substrate specificities to mediate the production of the flavonols, quercetin and kaempferol, in a tissue-specific and inducible manner. However, biochemical and genetic analysis of the six AtFLS sequences indicates that, although several of the members are expressed, only AtFLS1 encodes a catalytically competent protein. AtFLS1 also appears to be the only member of this group that influences flavonoid levels and the root gravitropic response in seedlings under nonstressed conditions. This study showed that the other expressed AtFLS sequences have tissue- and cell type-specific promoter activities that overlap with those of AtFLS1 and encode proteins that interact with other flavonoid enzymes in yeast two-hybrid assays. Thus, it is possible that these &quot;pseudogenes&quot; have alternative, noncatalytic functions that have not yet been uncovered."

In the developing cerebral cortex, the Ig superfamily cell adhesion molecule L1 associates with Nrp1. Intriguingly, the genetic removal of L1 blocks axon responses of cortical neurons to Sema3A in vitro despite the expression of Plexin-As in the cortex, suggesting either that L1 substitutes for Plexin-As or that L1 and Plexin-A are both required and mediate distinct roles. We report that association of Nrp1 with L1 but not Plexin-As mediates the recruitment and activation of a Sema3A-induced focal adhesion kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. This signalling downstream of L1 is needed for the disassembly of adherent points formed in growth cones and subsequently their collapse response to Sema3A. Plexin-As and L1 are coexpressed and present in common complexes in cortical neurons and both dominant-negative forms of Plexin-A and L1 impair their response to Sema3A. Consistently, Nrp1-expressing cortical projections are defective in mice lacking Plexin-A3, Plexin-A4 or L1. This reveals that specific signalling activities downstream of L1 and Plexin-As cooperate for mediating the axon guidance effects of Sema3A."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Platinum-based inhibitors of amyloid-beta as therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.,"Amelyoid-beta peptide (Abeta) is a major causative agent responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta contains a high affinity metal binding site that modulates peptide aggregation and toxicity. Therefore, identifying molecules targeting this site represents a valid therapeutic strategy. To test this hypothesis, a range of L-PtCl(2) (L = 1,10-phenanthroline derivatives) complexes were examined and shown to bind to Abeta, inhibit neurotoxicity and rescue Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity in mouse hippocampal slices. Coordination of the complexes to Abeta altered the chemical properties of the peptide inhibiting amyloid formation and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In comparison, the classic anticancer drug cisplatin did not affect any of the biochemical and cellular effects of Abeta. This implies that the planar aromatic 1,10-phenanthroline ligands L confer some specificity for Abeta onto the platinum complexes. The potent effect of the L-PtCl(2) complexes identifies this class of compounds as therapeutic agents for AD."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Human biliverdin reductase is an ERK activator; hBVR is an ERK nuclear transporter and is required for MAPK signaling.,"Activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-signaling cascade is a mechanism for relaying mitogenic and stress stimuli for gene activation. MEK1 is the proximate kinase for activation of ERK1/2, and nuclear targeting of ERK1/2 is obligatory for Elk1 transcriptional activity. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a recently described Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase in the MAPK insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-signaling cascade. Using 293A cells and in vitro experiments, we detail the formation of a ternary complex of MEK/ERK/hBVR, activation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 kinase activities by hBVR, and phosphorylation of hBVR by ERK1/2. hBVR is nearly as effective as IGF1 in activating ERK; intact hBVR ATP-binding domain is necessary for Elk1 activation, whereas protein-protein interaction is the basis for hBVR activation of MEK1 and ERK. The two MAPK docking consensus sequences present in hBVR, F(162)GFP and K(275)KRILHCLGL (C- and D-box, respectively), are ERK interactive sites; interaction at each site is critical for ERK/Elk1 activation. Transfection with mutant hBVR-P(165) or peptides corresponding to the C- or D-box blocked activation of ERK by IGF1. Transfection with D-box mutant hBVR prevented the activation of ERK by wild-type protein and dramatically decreased Elk1 transcriptional activity. hBVR is a nuclear transporter of ERK; experiments with hBVR nuclear export signal (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutants demonstrated its critical role in the nuclear localization of IGF-stimulated ERK for Elk1 activation. These findings, together with observations that si-hBVR blocked activation of ERK and Elk1 by IGF1 and prevented formation of ternary complex between MEK/ERK/hBVR, define the critical role of hBVR in ERK signaling and nuclear functions of the kinase."

The bisegmented dsRNA genomes of these viruses are separately packaged in icosahedral capsids containing 120 coat-protein subunits. We used transmission electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to determine the structure of Penicillium stoloniferum virus S at 7.3 A resolution. The capsid, approximately 350 A in outer diameter, contains 12 pentons, each of which is topped by five arched protrusions. Each of these protrusions is, in turn, formed by a quasisymmetric dimer of coat protein, for a total of 60 such dimers per particle. The density map shows numerous tubular features, characteristic of alpha helices and consistent with secondary structure predictions for the coat protein. This three-dimensional structure of a virus from the family Partitiviridae exhibits both similarities to and differences from the so-called &quot;T = 2&quot; capsids of other dsRNA viruses."
19542463,1,Structure,101087697,2008,Multiple conformations of E. coli Hsp90 in solution: insights into the conformational dynamics of Hsp90.,"Hsp90, an essential eukaryotic chaperone, depends upon its intrinsic ATPase activity for function. Crystal structures of the bacterial Hsp90 homolog, HtpG, and the yeast Hsp90 reveal large domain rearrangements between the nucleotide-free and the nucleotide-bound forms. We used small-angle X-ray scattering and recently developed molecular modeling methods to characterize the solution structure of HtpG and demonstrate how it differs from known Hsp90 conformations. In addition to this HtpG conformation, we demonstrate that under physiologically relevant conditions, multiple conformations coexist in equilibrium. In solution, nucleotide-free HtpG adopts a more extended conformation than observed in the crystal, and upon the addition of AMPPNP, HtpG is in equilibrium between this open state and a closed state that is in good agreement with the yeast AMPPNP crystal structure. These studies provide a unique view of Hsp90 conformational dynamics and provide a model for the role of nucleotide in effecting conformational change."

The study of the activated structure has been hampered by uncontrollable polymerization. We have engineered a stable activated complex consisting of Arp2/3 complex, the WCA activator region of N-WASP, and one actin monomer, and studied its structure in solution by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The scattering data support a model in which the first actin subunit binds at the barbed end of Arp2, and disqualify an alternative model that places the first actin subunit at the barbed end of Arp3. This location of the first actin and bound W motif constrains the binding site of the C motif to subunits Arp2 and ARPC1, from where the A motif can reach subunits Arp3 and ARPC3. The results support a model of activation that is consistent with most of the biochemical observations."

Here, we report that the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osterix (Osx), which is required for osteoblast differentiation, inhibits Wnt pathway activity. First, in calvarial cells of embryonic day (E)18.5 Osx-null embryos, expression of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 was abolished, and that of Wnt target genes c-Myc and cyclin D1 was increased. Moreover, our studies demonstrated that Osx bound to and activated the Dkk1 promoter. In addition, Osx inhibited beta-catenin-induced Topflash reporter activity and beta-catenin-induced secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos. Importantly, in calvaria of E18.5 Osx-null embryos harboring the TOPGAL reporter transgene, beta-galactosidase activity was increased, suggesting that Osx inhibited the Wnt pathway in osteoblasts in vivo. Our data further showed that Osx disrupted binding of Tcf to DNA, providing a likely mechanism for the inhibition by Osx of beta-catenin transcriptional activity. We also showed that Osx decreased osteoblast proliferation. Indeed, E18.5 Osx-null calvaria showed greater BrdU incorporation than wild-type calvaria and that Osx overexpression in C2C12 mesenchymal cells inhibited cell growth. Because Wnt signaling has a major role in stimulating osteoblast proliferation, we speculate that Osx-mediated inhibition of osteoblast proliferation is a consequence of the Osx-mediated control of Wnt/beta-catenin activity. Our results add a layer of control to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in bone."

AurF is a metalloenzyme, but its native enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated in vitro, and its catalytic mechanism is unclear. In addition, the nature of the cofactor remains a controversy. Here, we report the in vitro reconstitution of the AurF enzyme activity, the crystal structure of AurF in the oxidized state, and the cocrystal structure of AurF with its product pNBA. Our combined biochemical and structural analysis unequivocally indicates that AurF is a non-heme di-iron monooxygenase that catalyzes sequential oxidation of aminoarenes to nitroarenes via hydroxylamine and nitroso intermediates."

In the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) it exists in a partially oxidized form with two S-S bonds and two reduced cysteines (HCox17(2S-S)). HCox17(2S-S) is involved in copper transfer to the human cochaperones Sco1 and Cox11, which are implicated in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. We show here that Cu(I)HCox17(2S-S), i.e., the copper-loaded form of the protein, can transfer simultaneously copper(I) and two electrons to the human cochaperone Sco1 (HSco1) in the oxidized state, i.e., with its metal-binding cysteines forming a disulfide bond. The result is Cu(I)HSco1 and the fully oxidized apoHCox17(3S-S), which can be then reduced by glutathione to apoHCox17(2S-S). The HSco1/HCox17(2S-S) redox reaction is thermodynamically driven by copper transfer. These reactions may occur in vivo because HSco1 can be found in the partially oxidized state within the IMS, consistent with the variable redox properties of the latter compartment. The electron transfer-coupled metallation of HSco1 can be a mechanism within the IMS for an efficient specific transfer of the metal to proteins, where metal-binding thiols are oxidized. The same reaction of copper-electron-coupled transfer does not occur with the human homolog of Sco1, HSco2, for kinetic reasons that may be ascribed to the lack of a specific metal-bridged protein-protein complex, which is instead observed in the Cu(I)HCox17(2S-S)/HSco1 interaction."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,COI1 is a critical component of a receptor for jasmonate and the bacterial virulence factor coronatine.,"Jasmonate (JA) is a lipid-derived hormone that regulates diverse aspects of plant immunity and development. An amino acid-conjugated form of JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), stimulates binding of the F-box protein coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1) to, and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of, jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins that repress transcription of JA-responsive genes. The virulence factor coronatine (COR), which is produced by plant pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas syringae, suppresses host defense responses by activating JA signaling in a COI1-dependent manner. Although previous data indicate that COR acts as a molecular mimic of JA-Ile, the mechanism by which JA-Ile and COR are perceived by plant cells remains unknown. Here, we show that interaction of tomato COI1 with divergent members of the JAZ family is highly specific for JA-Ile and structurally related JA conjugates and that COR is approximately 1,000-fold more active than JA-Ile in promoting this interaction in vitro. JA-Ile competes for binding of COR to COI1-JAZ complexes, demonstrating that COR and JA-Ile are recognized by the same receptor. Binding of COR to the COI1-JAZ complex requires COI1 and is severely impaired by a point mutation in the putative ligand-binding pocket of COI1. Finally, we show that the C-terminal region of JAZ3 containing the highly conserved Jas motif is necessary and sufficient for hormone-induced COI1-JAZ interaction. These findings demonstrate that COI1 is a critical component of the JA receptor and that COR exerts its virulence effects by functioning as a potent agonist of this receptor system."

Here, we address plasticity and interconnection of distinct signal transduction pathways within this network. In Caulobacter crescentus antagonistic activities of the PleC phosphatase and DivJ kinase localized at opposite cell poles control the phosphorylation state and subcellular localization of the cell fate determinator protein DivK. We show that DivK functions as an allosteric regulator that switches PleC from a phosphatase into an autokinase state and thereby mediates a cyclic di-GMP-dependent morphogenetic program. Through allosteric activation of the DivJ autokinase, DivK also stimulates its own phosphorylation and polar localization. These data suggest that DivK is the central effector of an integrated circuit that operates via spatially organized feedback loops to control asymmetry and cell fate determination in C. crescentus. Thus, single domain response regulators can facilitate crosstalk, feedback control, and long-range communication among members of the two-component network."

We report here the identification of a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein-8 (TNFAIP8) family, designated TIPE2, that is required for maintaining immune homeostasis. TIPE2 is preferentially expressed in lymphoid tissues, and its deletion in mice leads to multiorgan inflammation, splenomegaly, and premature death. TIPE2-deficient animals are hypersensitive to septic shock, and TIPE2-deficient cells are hyper-responsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Importantly, TIPE2 binds to caspase-8 and inhibits activating protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB activation while promoting Fas-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting caspase-8 significantly blocks the hyper-responsiveness of TIPE2-deficient cells. These results establish that TIPE2 is an essential negative regulator of TLR and TCR function, and its selective expression in the immune system prevents hyperresponsiveness and maintains immune homeostasis."

Blockade of the kinase activity of EGFR has been used for cancer therapy; however, by itself, it does not seem to reach maximum therapeutic efficacy.

These biological actions are mediated primarily through nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERs). The ligand-dependent transactivation of ERs requires several nuclear co-regulator complexes; however, the cell-cycle-dependent associations of these complexes are poorly understood. By using a synchronization system, we found that the transactivation function of ERalpha at G2/M was lowered. Biochemical approaches showed that ERalpha associated with two discrete classes of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. The components of the NuRD-type complex were identified as G2/M-phase-specific ERalpha co-repressors. Thus, our results indicate that the transactivation function of ERalpha is cell-cycle dependent and is coupled with a cell-cycle-dependent association of chromatin-remodelling complexes."

Both RERE and Atro share the ELM2 (EGL-27 and MTA1 homology 2) and SANT (SWI3/ADA2/N-CoR/TFIII-B) domains, which are also present in other important transcriptional cofactors. Here, we report that the SANT domain in RERE binds to the histone methyltransferase G9a, and that both the ELM2 and SANT domains orchestrate molecular events that lead to a stable methylation of histone H3-lysine 9. We establish the physiological relevance of these interactions among Atrophin, G9a, and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 in Drosophila by showing that these proteins localize to overlapping chromosomal loci, and act together to suppress wing vein and melanotic-mass formation. This study not only shows a new function of the SANT domain and establishes its connection with the ELM2 domain, but also implies that a similar strategy is used by other ELM2-SANT proteins to repress gene transcription and to exert biological effects."

Here, we report that Strap is inducible by heat shock and stimulates the transcription of heat-shock genes. A chromatin-associated complex involving heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), Strap and the p300 coactivator assembles on the heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) promoter, and Strap augments HSF1 binding and chromatin acetylation in Hsp genes, most probably through the p300 histone acetyltransferase. Cells depleted of Strap do not survive under heat-shock conditions. These results indicate that Strap is an essential cofactor that acts at the level of chromatin control to regulate heat-shock-responsive transcription."

The mediator complex is essential for the transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes; it associates with an accessory subcomplex consisting of the Med12, Med13, Cdk8, and Cyclin C subunits. We show here that the Med12 and Med13 subunits of the Drosophila mediator complex, encoded by kohtalo and skuld, are essential for the transcription of Wingless target genes. kohtalo and skuld act downstream of beta-catenin stabilization both in vivo and in cell culture. They are required for transcriptional activation by the N-terminal domain of Pygopus, and their physical interaction with Pygopus depends on this domain. We propose that Pygopus promotes Wnt target gene transcription by recruiting the mediator complex through interactions with Med12 and Med13."

The expression of Mad1 suppresses Myc-mediated cell proliferation and transformation. The levels of Mad1 protein are generally low in many human cancers, and Mad1 protein has a very short half-life. However, the mechanism that regulates the turnover of Mad1 protein is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that Mad1 is a substrate of p90 ribosomal kinase (RSK) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K). Both RSK and S6K phosphorylate serine 145 of Mad1 upon serum or insulin stimulation. Ser-145 phosphorylation of Mad1 accelerates the ubiquitination and degradation of Mad1 through the 26S proteasome pathway, which in turn promotes the transcriptional activity of Myc. Our study provides a direct link between the growth factor signaling pathways regulated by PI3 kinase/Akt and MAP kinases with Myc-mediated transcription."

Fibrillins form the core of these multicomponent assemblies. Various human genetic disorders, the fibrillinopathies, arise from mutations in fibrillins and are frequently associated with aberrant microfibril assembly. These disorders include Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Beals syndrome, and others. Although homotypic and heterotypic fibrillin self-interactions are considered to provide critical initial steps, the detailed mechanisms for microfibril assembly are unknown. We show here that the C-terminal recombinant half of fibrillin-1 assembles into disulfide-bonded multimeric globular structures with peripheral arms and a dense core. These globules are similar to the beaded structures observed in microfibrils isolated from tissues. Only these C-terminal fibrillin-1 multimers interacted strongly with the fibrillin-1 N terminus, whereas the monomers showed very little self-interaction activity. The multimers strongly inhibited microfibril formation in cell culture, providing evidence that these recombinant assemblies can also interact with endogenous fibrillin-1. The C-terminal self-interaction site was fine-mapped to the last three calcium-binding EGF domains in fibrillin-1. These results suggest a new mechanism for microfibril formation where fibrillin-1 first oligomerizes via its C terminus before the partially or fully assembled bead-like structures can further interact with other beads via the fibrillin-1 N termini."

However, the etiology of most cases of hypertension remains unexplained. Vascular tone, an important determinant of blood pressure, is regulated by nitric oxide, which causes vascular relaxation by increasing intracellular cGMP and activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKGI). Here we show that mice with a selective mutation in the N-terminal protein interaction domain of PKGIalpha display inherited vascular smooth muscle cell abnormalities of contraction, abnormal relaxation of large and resistance blood vessels, and increased systemic blood pressure. Renal function studies and responses to changes in dietary sodium in the PKGIalpha mutant mice are normal. These data reveal that PKGIalpha is required for normal VSMC physiology and support the idea that high blood pressure can arise from a primary abnormality of vascular smooth muscle cell contractile regulation, suggesting a new approach to the diagnosis and therapy of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases."

Here we identify a mechanism for GLP-1 action, showing that the scaffold protein beta-arrestin-1 mediates the effects of GLP-1 to stimulate cAMP production and insulin secretion in beta cells. Using a coimmunoprecipitation technique, we also found a physical association between the GLP-1 R and beta-arrestin-1 in cultured INS-1 pancreatic beta cells. beta-Arrestin-1 knockdown broadly attenuated GLP-1 signaling, causing decreased ERK and CREB activation and IRS-2 expression as well as reduced cAMP levels and impaired insulin secretion. However, beta-arrestin-1 knockdown did not affect GLP-1 R surface expression and ligand-induced GLP-1 R internalization/desensitization. Taken together, these studies indicate that beta-arrestin-1 plays a role in GLP-1 signaling leading to insulin secretion, defining a previously undescribed mechanism for GLP-1 action."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The crystal structure and dimerization interface of GADD45gamma.,"Gadd45 proteins are recognized as tumor and autoimmune suppressors whose expression can be induced by genotoxic stresses. These proteins are involved in cell cycle control, growth arrest, and apoptosis through interactions with a wide variety of binding partners. We report here the crystal structure of Gadd45gamma, which reveals a fold comprising an alphabetaalpha sandwich with a central five-stranded mixed beta-sheet with alpha-helices packed on either side. Based on crystallographic symmetry we identified the dimer interface of Gadd45gamma dimers by generating point mutants that compromised dimerization while leaving the tertiary structure of the monomer intact. The dimer interface comprises a four-helix bundle involving residues that are the most highly conserved among Gadd45 isoforms. Cell-based assays using these point mutants demonstrate that dimerization is essential for growth inhibition. This structural information provides a new context for evaluation of the plethora of protein-protein interactions that govern the many functions of the Gadd45 family of proteins."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Phenotypic transcription factors epigenetically mediate cell growth control.,"Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are down-regulated during osteogenesis, myogenesis, and adipogenesis, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of interrelationships between growth control and phenotype commitment. Here, we show that cell fate-determining factors [MyoD, myogenin (Mgn), Runx2, C/EBPbeta] occupy rDNA loci and suppress rRNA expression during lineage progression, concomitant with decreased rRNA expression and reciprocal loss of occupancy by c-Myc, a proliferation-specific activator of rRNA transcription. We find interaction of phenotypic factors with the polymerase I activator upstream binding factor UBF-1 at interphase nucleoli, and this interaction is epigenetically retained on mitotic chromosomes at nucleolar organizing regions. Ectopic expression and RNA interference establish that MyoD, Mgn, Runx2, and C/EBPbeta each functionally suppress rRNA genes and global protein synthesis. We conclude that epigenetic control of ribosomal biogenesis by lineage-specific differentiation factors is a general developmental mechanism for coordinate control of cell growth and phenotype."
19549909,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Revealing the moonlighting role of NADP in the structure of a flavin-containing monooxygenase.,"Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are, after cytochromes P450, the most important monooxygenase system in humans and are involved in xenobiotics metabolism and variability in drug response. The x-ray structure of a soluble prokaryotic FMO from Methylophaga sp. strain SK1 has been solved at 2.6-A resolution and is now the protein of known structure with the highest sequence similarity to human FMOs. The structure possesses a two-domain architecture, with both FAD and NADP(+) well defined by the electron density maps. Biochemical analysis shows that the prokaryotic enzyme shares many functional properties with mammalian FMOs, including substrate specificity and the ability to stabilize the hydroperoxyflavin intermediate that is crucial in substrate oxygenation. On the basis of their location in the structure, the nicotinamide ring and the adjacent ribose of NADP(+) turn out to be an integral part of the catalytic site being actively engaged in the stabilization of the oxygenating intermediate. This feature suggests that NADP(H) has a moonlighting role, in that it adopts two binding modes that allow it to function in both flavin reduction and oxygen reactivity modulation, respectively. We hypothesize that a relative domain rotation is needed to bring NADP(H) to these distinct positions inside the active site. Localization of mutations in human FMO3 that are known to cause trimethylaminuria (fish-odor syndrome) in the elucidated FMO structure provides a structural explanation for their biological effects."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Molecular mechanism of pH sensing in KcsA potassium channels.,"The bacterial potassium channel KcsA is gated by high concentrations of intracellular protons, allowing the channel to open at pH &lt; 5.5. Despite prior attempts to determine the mechanism responsible for pH gating, the proton sensor has remained elusive. We have constructed a KcsA channel mutant that remains open up to pH 9.0 by replacing key ionizable residues from the N and C termini of KcsA with residues mimicking their protonated counterparts with respect to charge. A series of individual and combined mutations were investigated by using single-channel recordings in lipid bilayers. We propose that these residues are the proton-binding sites and at neutral pH they form a complex network of inter- and intrasubunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds near the bundle crossing that greatly stabilize the closed state. In our model, these residues change their ionization state at acidic pH, thereby disrupting this network, modifying the electrostatic landscape near the channel gate, and favoring channel opening."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Oxidation of archaeal peroxiredoxin involves a hypervalent sulfur intermediate.,"The oxidation of thiol groups in proteins is a common event in biochemical processes involving disulfide bond formation and in response to an increased level of reactive oxygen species. It has been widely accepted that the oxidation of a cysteine side chain is initiated by the formation of cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). Here, we demonstrate a mechanism of thiol oxidation through a hypervalent sulfur intermediate by presenting crystallographic evidence from an archaeal peroxiredoxin (Prx), the thioredoxin peroxidase from Aeropyrum pernix K1 (ApTPx). The reaction of Prx, which is the reduction of a peroxide, depends on the redox active cysteine side chains. Oxidation by hydrogen peroxide converted the active site peroxidatic Cys-50 of ApTPx to a cysteine sulfenic acid derivative, followed by further oxidation to cysteine sulfinic and sulfonic acids. The crystal structure of the cysteine sulfenic acid derivative was refined to 1.77 A resolution with R(cryst) and R(free) values of 18.8% and 22.0%, respectively. The refined structure, together with quantum chemical calculations, revealed that the sulfenic acid derivative is a type of sulfurane, a hypervalent sulfur compound, and that the S(gamma) atom is covalently linked to the N(delta1) atom of the neighboring His-42. The reaction mechanism is revealed by the hydrogen bond network around the peroxidatic cysteine and the motion of the flexible loop covering the active site and by quantum chemical calculations. This study provides evidence that a hypervalent sulfur compound occupies an important position in biochemical processes."

Previous studies have shown that recombinant huPrP23-144 can be efficiently converted in vitro to the fibrillar amyloid state, and that residues 138 and 139 play a critical role in the amyloidogenic properties of this protein. Here, we have used magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy to provide high-resolution insight into the protein backbone conformation and dynamics in fibrils formed by (13)C,(15)N-labeled huPrP23-144. Surprisingly, we find that signals from approximately 100 residues (i.e., approximately 80% of the sequence) are not detected above approximately -20 degrees C in conventional solid-state NMR spectra. Sequential resonance assignments revealed that signals, which are observed, arise exclusively from residues in the region 112-141. These resonances are remarkably narrow, exhibiting average (13)C and (15)N linewidths of approximately 0.6 and 1 ppm, respectively. Altogether, the present findings indicate the existence of a compact, highly ordered core of huPrP23-144 amyloid encompassing residues 112-141. Analysis of (13)C secondary chemical shifts identified likely beta-strand segments within this core region, including beta-strand 130-139 containing critical residues 138 and 139. In contrast to this relatively rigid, beta-sheet-rich amyloid core, the remaining residues in huPrP23-144 amyloid fibrils under physiologically relevant conditions are largely unordered, displaying significant conformational dynamics."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Requirement of Nanog dimerization for stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency.,"Pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells is maintained by transcription factors that form a highly interconnected protein interaction network surrounding the homeobox protein Nanog. Enforced expression of Nanog in mouse ES (mES) cells promotes self-renewal and alleviates their requirement for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Understanding molecular mechanisms by which Nanog functions should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming. Previously, we showed that Nanog forms multiple protein complexes in mES cells. Here, we demonstrate that Nanog dimerizes through its C-terminal domain rather than the homeodomain. Dimerization is required for interaction with other pluripotency network proteins. We also show that enforced expression of the Nanog dimer, but not the monomer, functionally replaces wild-type Nanog to sustain LIF-independent self-renewal of ES cells. Our results demonstrate that Nanog-Nanog homodimerization is a critical aspect of its function promoting stem cell pluripotency."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The Bro1-related protein HD-PTP/PTPN23 is required for endosomal cargo sorting and multivesicular body morphogenesis.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Bro1p is required for sorting endocytic cargo to the lumen of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The mammalian ortholog of Bro1p is not known; although Alix, a structurally related protein, supports the topologically similar process of virus budding, functional studies have so far failed to identify a role for Alix in MVB formation. To establish whether Alix or similar protein(s) participate in endosomal sorting, we attached a retroviral peptide that binds Alix to a reporter receptor. This chimera was sorted efficiently away from the early endosome to the lumen of late endocytic compartments. Surprisingly, sorting was not prevented by depleting Alix but instead required the Alix-related protein His domain phosphotyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP)/His-Domain/Type N23 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN23). Depletion of HD-PTP also reduced transfer of fluid-phase markers and EGF receptor to lysosomes, caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins on endosomal compartments and disrupted the morphogenesis of MVBs. Rescue experiments using an RNAi-resistant version of HD-PTP and HD-PTP mutants demonstrated an essential role for the HD-PTP Bro1 domain, with ESCRT-III binding correlating with full biological activity."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Molecular architecture of Galphao and the structural basis for RGS16-mediated deactivation.,"Heterotrimeric G proteins relay extracellular cues from heptahelical transmembrane receptors to downstream effector molecules. Composed of an alpha subunit with intrinsic GTPase activity and a betagamma heterodimer, the trimeric complex dissociates upon receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange on the alpha subunit, enabling each component to engage downstream effector targets for either activation or inhibition as dictated in a particular pathway. To mitigate excessive effector engagement and concomitant signal transmission, the Galpha subunit's intrinsic activation timer (the rate of GTP hydrolysis) is regulated spatially and temporally by a class of GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) known as the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family. The array of G protein-coupled receptors, Galpha subunits, RGS proteins and downstream effectors in mammalian systems is vast. Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity is critical for a comprehensive mapping of the G protein system. Here, we present the 2.9 A crystal structure of the enigmatic, neuronal G protein Galpha(o) in the GTP hydrolytic transition state, complexed with RGS16. Comparison with the 1.89 A structure of apo-RGS16, also presented here, reveals plasticity upon Galpha(o) binding, the determinants for GAP activity, and the structurally unique features of Galpha(o) that likely distinguish it physiologically from other members of the larger Galpha(i) family, affording insight to receptor, GAP and effector specificity."

Virol.,113724,2008,Functional and physical interactions of the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL20 membrane protein with glycoprotein K.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein K (gK) and the UL20 protein (UL20p) are coordinately transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and cell surfaces and are required for cytoplasmic virion envelopment at the TGN. In addition, cell surface expression of gK and UL20p is required for virus-induced cell fusion. Previously, confocal microscopy colocalization and intracellular transport experiments strongly suggested direct protein-protein interactions between gK and UL20p. Direct protein-protein interactions between gK and UL20p were demonstrated through reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments, as well as with glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments. A fusion protein consisting of the amino-terminal 66 amino acids of UL20p fused in-frame with GST was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via glutathione column chromatography. Precipitation of GST-UL20p from mixtures of GST-UL20p fusion protein with cellular extracts containing gK specifically coprecipitated gK but not other viral glycoproteins. The purified UL20p-GST fusion protein reacted with all gK-associated protein species. It was concluded that the amino terminus of UL20p, most likely, interacted with gK domain III, which is predicted to lie intracellularly. UL20p-gK domain-specific interactions must serve important functions in the coordinate transport of UL20p and gK to the TGN, because retention of UL20p in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the addition of an ER retention signal at the carboxyl terminus of UL20p forced the ER retention of gK and drastically inhibited intracellular virion envelopment and virus-induced cell fusion."
19553527,0,Genetics,374636,2008,Functional conservation of the yeast and Arabidopsis RAD54-like genes.,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD54 gene has critical roles in DNA double-strand break repair, homologous recombination, and gene targeting. Previous results show that the yeast gene enhances gene targeting when expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work we address the trans-species compatibility of Rad54 functions. We show that overexpression of yeast RAD54 in Arabidopsis enhances DNA damage resistance severalfold. Thus, the yeast gene is active in the Arabidopsis homologous-recombination repair system. Moreover, we have identified an A. thaliana ortholog of yeast RAD54, named AtRAD54. This gene, with close sequence similarity to RAD54, complements methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) sensitivity but not UV sensitivity or gene targeting defects of rad54Delta mutant yeast cells. Overexpression of AtRAD54 in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced resistance to DNA damage. This gene's assignment as a RAD54 ortholog is further supported by the interaction of AtRad54 with AtRad51 and the interactions between alien proteins (i.e., yeast Rad54 with AtRAD51 and yeast Rad51 with AtRad54) in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. These interactions hint at the molecular nature of this interkingdom complementation, although the stronger effect of the yeast Rad54 in plants than AtRad54 in yeast might be explained by an ability of the Rad54 protein to act alone, independently of its interaction with Rad51."
19553938,0,BMC Mol. Biol.,100966983,2008,Interaction of circadian clock proteins PER2 and CRY with BMAL1 and CLOCK.,"BACKGROUND: Circadian oscillation of clock-controlled gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Heterodimers of CLOCK and BMAL1 act as activators of target gene transcription; however, interactions of PER and CRY proteins with the heterodimer abolish its transcriptional activation capacity. PER and CRY are therefore referred to as negative regulators of the circadian clock. To further elucidate the mechanism how positive and negative components of the clock interplay, we characterized the interactions of PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 with BMAL1 and CLOCK using a mammalian two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Both PER2 and the CRY proteins were found to interact with BMAL1 whereas only PER2 interacts with CLOCK. CRY proteins seem to have a higher affinity to BMAL1 than PER2. Moreover, we provide evidence that PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 bind to different domains in the BMAL1 protein. CONCLUSION: The regulators of clock-controlled transcription PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 differ in their capacity to interact with each single component of the BMAL1-CLOCK heterodimer and, in the case of BMAL1, also in their interaction sites. Our data supports the hypothesis that CRY proteins, especially CRY1, are stronger repressors than PER proteins."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The antibody zalutumumab inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor signaling by limiting intra- and intermolecular flexibility.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates cellular pathways controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. It thus represents a valid therapeutic target for treating solid cancers. Here, we used an electron microscopy-based technique (Protein Tomography) to study the structural rearrangement accompanying activation and inhibition of native, individual, EGFR molecules. Reconstructed tomograms (3D density maps) showed a level of detail that allowed individual domains to be discerned. Monomeric, resting EGFR ectodomains demonstrated large flexibility, and a number of distinct conformations were observed. In contrast, ligand-activated EGFR complexes were detected only as receptor dimers with ring-like conformations. Zalutumumab, a therapeutic inhibitory EGFR antibody directed against domain III, locked EGFR molecules into a very compact, inactive conformation. Biochemical analyses showed bivalent binding of zalutumumab to provide potent inhibition of EGFR signaling. The structure of EGFR-zalutumumab complexes on the cell surface visualized by Protein Tomography indicates that the cross-linking spatially separates the EGFR molecules' intracellular kinase domains to an extent that appears incompatible with the induction of signaling. These insights into the mechanisms of action of receptor inhibition may also apply to other cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Notch signaling mediates hypoxia-induced tumor cell migration and invasion.,"Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased metastatic potential, but the molecular mechanisms coupling hypoxia to metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we show that Notch signaling is required to convert the hypoxic stimulus into epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased motility, and invasiveness. Inhibition of Notch signaling abrogated hypoxia-induced EMT and invasion, and, conversely, an activated form of Notch could substitute for hypoxia to induce these processes. Notch signaling deploys two distinct mechanisms that act in synergy to control the expression of Snail-1, a critical regulator of EMT. First, Notch directly up-regulated Snail-1 expression by recruitment of the Notch intracellular domain to the Snail-1 promoter, and second, Notch potentiated hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) recruitment to the lysyl oxidase (LOX) promoter and elevated the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of LOX, which stabilizes the Snail-1 protein. In sum, these data demonstrate a complex integration of the hypoxia and Notch signaling pathways in regulation of EMT and open up perspectives for pharmacological intervention with hypoxiainduced EMT and cell invasiveness in tumors."
19556508,0,Cell,413066,2008,Rac1 activation controls nuclear localization of beta-catenin during canonical Wnt signaling.,"Canonical Wnt signaling critically regulates cell fate and proliferation in development and disease. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin is indispensable for canonical Wnt signaling; however, the mechanisms governing beta-catenin nuclear localization are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in response to Wnt requires Rac1 activation. The role of Rac1 depends on phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser191 and Ser605, which is mediated by JNK2 kinase. Mutations of these residues significantly affect Wnt-induced beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. Genetic ablation of Rac1 in the mouse embryonic limb bud ectoderm disrupts canonical Wnt signaling and phenocopies deletion of beta-catenin in causing severe truncations of the limb. Finally, Rac1 interacts genetically with beta-catenin and Dkk1 in controlling limb outgrowth. Together these results uncover Rac1 activation and subsequent beta-catenin phosphorylation as a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism controlling canonical Wnt signaling and may provide additional targets for therapeutic intervention of this important pathway."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The MUT9p kinase phosphorylates histone H3 threonine 3 and is necessary for heritable epigenetic silencing in Chlamydomonas.,"Changes in chromatin organization are emerging as key regulators in nearly every aspect of DNA-templated metabolism in eukaryotes. Histones undergo many, largely reversible, posttranslational modifications that affect chromatin structure. Some modifications, such as trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me3), correlate with transcriptional activation, whereas others, such as methylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27me), are associated with silent chromatin. Posttranslational histone modifications may also be involved in the inheritance of chromatin states. Histone phosphorylation has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes but, because of the dynamic nature of this modification, its potential role in long-term gene silencing has remained relatively unexplored. We report here that a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant defective in a Ser/Thr protein kinase (MUT9p), which phosphorylates histones H3 and H2A, shows deficiencies in the heritable repression of transgenes and transposons. Moreover, based on chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, phosphorylated H3T3 (H3T3ph) and monomethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1) are inversely correlated with di/trimethylated H3K4 and associate preferentially with silenced transcription units. Conversely, the loss of those marks in mutant strains correlates with the transcriptional reactivation of transgenes and transposons. Our results suggest that H3T3ph and H3K4me1 function as reinforcing epigenetic marks for the silencing of euchromatic loci in Chlamydomonas."

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified dynein light chain 1 as a novel interacting partner of RACK1. Additionally, we demonstrated that RACK1 formed a complex with DLC1 and Bim, specifically BimEL, in the presence of apoptotic agents. Upon paclitaxel treatment, RACK1, DLC1, and CIS mediated the degradation of BimEL through the ElonginB/C-Cullin2-CIS ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex. We further showed that RACK1 conferred paclitaxel resistance to breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we observed an inverse correlation between CIS and BimEL levels in both ovarian and breast cancer cell lines and specimens. Our study suggests a role of RACK1 in protecting cancer cells from apoptosis by regulating the degradation of BimEL, which together with CIS could play an important role of drug resistance in chemotherapy."
19556540,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Topoisomerase IIIalpha is required for normal proliferation and telomere stability in alternative lengthening of telomeres.,"Topoisomerase (Topo) IIIalpha associates with BLM helicase, which is proposed to be important in the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway that allows telomere recombination in the absence of telomerase. Here, we show that human Topo IIIalpha colocalizes with telomeric proteins at ALT-associated promyelocytic bodies from ALT cells. In these cells, Topo IIIalpha immunoprecipitated with telomere binding protein (TRF) 2 and BLM and was shown to be associated with telomeric DNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting that these proteins form a complex at telomere sequences. Topo IIIalpha depletion by small interfering RNA reduced ALT cell survival, but did not affect telomerase-positive cell lines. Moreover, repression of Topo IIIalpha expression in ALT cells reduced the levels of TRF2 and BLM proteins, provoked a strong increase in the formation of anaphase bridges, induced the degradation of the G-overhang signal, and resulted in the appearance of DNA damage at telomeres. In contrast, telomere maintenance and TRF2 levels were unaffected in telomerase-positive cells. We conclude that Topo IIIalpha is an important telomere-associated factor, essential for telomere maintenance and chromosome stability in ALT cells, and speculate on its potential mechanistic function."
19556970,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Yeast and human Ysl2p/hMon2 interact with Gga adaptors and mediate their subcellular distribution.,"The Gga proteins represent a family of ubiquitously expressed clathrin adaptors engaged in vesicle budding at the tubular endosomal network/trans Golgi network. Their membrane recruitment is commonly thought to involve interactions with Arf and signals in cargo through the so-called VHS domain. For yeast Gga proteins, however, partners binding to its VHS domain have remained elusive and Gga localization does not absolutely depend on Arf. Here, we demonstrate that yeast Gga recruitment relies on a network of interactions between the scaffold Ysl2p/Mon2p, the small GTPase Arl1p, and the flippase Neo1p. Deletion of either YSL2 or ARL1 causes mislocalization of Gga2p, whereas a neo1-69 mutant accumulates Gga2p on aberrant structures. Remarkably, Ysl2p directly interacts with human and yeast Ggas through the VHS domain, and binding to Gga proteins is also found for the human Ysl2p orthologue hMon2. Thus, Ysl2p represents an essential, evolutionarily conserved member of a network controlling direct binding and membrane docking of Ggas. Because activated Arl1p is part of the network that binds Gga2p, Arf and Arf-like GTPases may interact in a regulatory cascade."

An important protection against these failures is cellular apoptosis, which can be induced by p66(Shc) in response to cellular stress. The precise mechanisms of p66(Shc) action and regulation and the function of the p66(Shc)-specific N terminus remain to be identified. Here, we show that the p66(Shc) N terminus forms a redox module responsible for apoptosis initiation, and that this module can be activated through reversible tetramerization by forming two disulfide bonds. Glutathione and thioredoxins can reduce and inactivate p66(Shc), resulting in a thiol-based redox sensor system that initiates apoptosis once cellular protection systems cannot cope anymore with cellular stress."

The interaction of E1A with p400 is essential for many E1A activities, but the downstream target of this interaction is unknown. Here, we present evidence that the oncoprotein transcription factor Myc is the target of this interaction. We show that E1A stabilizes Myc protein via p400 and promotes the coassociation of Myc and p400 at Myc target genes, leading to their transcriptional induction. We also show that E1A requires Myc for its ability to activate Myc-dependent gene expression and induce apoptosis, and that forced expression of Myc is sufficient to rescue the activity of an E1A-mutant defective in p400 binding. Together, these findings establish that Myc, via p400, is an essential downstream target of E1A."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Membrane damage by human islet amyloid polypeptide through fibril growth at the membrane.,"Fibrillar protein deposits (amyloid) in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are thought to be involved in death of the insulin-producing islet beta cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that the mechanism of this beta cell death involves membrane disruption by human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), the major constituent of islet amyloid. However, the molecular mechanism of hIAPP-induced membrane disruption is not known. Here, we propose a hypothesis that growth of hIAPP fibrils at the membrane causes membrane damage. We studied the kinetics of hIAPP-induced membrane damage in relation to hIAPP fibril growth and found that the kinetic profile of hIAPP-induced membrane damage is characterized by a lag phase and a sigmoidal transition, which matches the kinetic profile of hIAPP fibril growth. The observation that seeding accelerates membrane damage supports the hypothesis. In addition, variables that are well known to affect hIAPP fibril formation, i.e., the presence of a fibril formation inhibitor, hIAPP concentration, and lipid composition, were found to have the same effect on hIAPP-induced membrane damage. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis showed that hIAPP fibrils line the surface of distorted phospholipid vesicles, in agreement with the notion that hIAPP fibril growth at the membrane and membrane damage are physically connected. Together, these observations point toward a mechanism in which growth of hIAPP fibrils, rather than a particular hIAPP species, is responsible for the observed membrane damage. This hypothesis provides an additional mechanism next to the previously proposed role of oligomers as the main cytotoxic species of amyloidogenic proteins."

Chem.,2985121R,2008,USP11 stabilizes HPV-16E7 and further modulates the E7 biological activity.,"HPV-16E7 is a major transforming protein, which has been implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The stability of E7 is thus important to ensure its fully functional status. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that USP11 (ubiquitin-specific protease 11), a member of a protein family that cleaves polyubiquitin chains and/or ubiquitin precursors, interacts and forms a specific complex with HPV-16E7. Our results indicate that the USP11 can greatly increase the steady state level of HPV-16E7 by reducing ubiquitination and attenuating E7 degradation. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of USP11 abolished the deubiquitinating ability and returned E7 to a normal rate of degradation. Moreover, USP11 not only protected E7 from ubiquitination but also influenced E7 function as a modulator of cell growth status. These results suggest that USP11 plays an important role in regulating the levels of E7 protein and subsequently affects the biological function of E7 as well as its contribution to cell transformation by HPV-16E7."

During ERAD in S. cerevisiae, the ATPase Cdc48p associates with Der1p, a putative component of a retro-translocation channel. Cdc48p also binds a homolog of Der1p, Dfm1p, that has no known function in ERAD. Here, we show that Der1p and Dfm1p are contained in distinct complexes. While the complexes share several ERAD components, only the Dfm1p complex contains the Cdc48p cofactors Ubx1p and Ubx7p, while the Der1p complex is enriched in Ufd1p. These data suggest distinct functions for the Der1p and Dfm1p complexes."
19559631,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,Interferon gamma is recognised by importin alpha/beta: enhanced nuclear localising and transactivation activities of an interferon gamma mimetic.,"Interferon (IFN) gamma's ability to localise in the nucleus and function in gene activation has been known for some time, although the role of the conventional nuclear transporting importin molecules is unclear. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the direct recognition of IFNgamma and an IFNgamma mimetic peptide by IMPalpha and the IMPalpha/beta heterodimer, where the IFNgamma mimetic shows higher affinity. Significantly, this correlates well both with in vivo ability to target green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in transfected cells as determined by quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy, as well as GAS promoter activity of a luciferase reporter. This has important implications for IFNgamma's anti-viral action, and the potential use of the IFNgamma mimetic in antiviral therapies."
19559670,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,The histone-binding protein COPR5 is required for nuclear functions of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5.,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) targets nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Here, we identified a nuclear protein, called cooperator of PRMT5 (COPR5), involved in the nuclear functions of PRMT5. COPR5 tightly binds to PRMT5, both in vitro and in living cells, but not to other members of the PRMT family. PRMT5 bound to COPR5 methylates histone H4 (R3) preferentially when compared with histone H3 (R8), suggesting that COPR5 modulates the substrate specificity of nuclear PRMT5-containing complexes, at least towards histones. Markedly, recombinant COPR5 binds to the amino terminus of histone H4 and is required to recruit PRMT5 to reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro. Consistently, COPR5 depletion in cells strongly reduces PRMT5 recruitment on chromatin at the PRMT5 target gene cyclin E1 (CCNE1) in vivo. Moreover, both COPR5 depletion and overexpression affect CCNE1 promoter expression. We propose that COPR5 is an important chromatin adaptor for PRMT5 to function on a subset of its target genes."
19560442,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,NF-kappaB dictates the degradation pathway of IkappaBalpha.,"IkappaB proteins are known as the regulators of NF-kappaB activity. They bind tightly to NF-kappaB dimers, until stimulus-responsive N-terminal phosphorylation by IKK triggers their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. It is known that IkappaBalpha is an unstable protein whose rapid degradation is slowed upon binding to NF-kappaB, but it is not known what dynamic mechanisms control the steady-state level of total IkappaBalpha. Here, we show clearly that two degradation pathways control the level of IkappaBalpha. Free IkappaBalpha degradation is not controlled by IKK or ubiquitination but intrinsically, by the C-terminal sequence known as the PEST domain. NF-kappaB binding to IkappaBalpha masks the PEST domain from proteasomal recognition, precluding ubiquitin-independent degradation; bound IkappaBalpha then requires IKK phosphorylation and ubiquitination for slow basal degradation. We show the biological requirement for the fast degradation of the free IkappaBalpha protein; alteration of free IkappaBalpha degradation dampens NF-kappaB activation. In addition, we find that both free and bound IkappaBalpha are similar substrates for IKK, and the preferential phosphorylation of NF-kappaB-bound IkappaBalpha is due to stabilization of IkappaBalpha by NF-kappaB."
19561080,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Crystal structure of the CaV2 IQ domain in complex with Ca2+/calmodulin: high-resolution mechanistic implications for channel regulation by Ca2+.,"Calmodulin (CaM) regulation of Ca(2+) channels is central to Ca(2+) signaling. Ca(V)1 versus Ca(V)2 classes of these channels exhibit divergent forms of regulation, potentially relating to customized CaM/IQ interactions among different channels. Here we report the crystal structures for the Ca(2+)/CaM IQ domains of both Ca(V)2.1 and Ca(V)2.3 channels. These highly similar structures emphasize that major CaM contacts with the IQ domain extend well upstream of traditional consensus residues. Surprisingly, upstream mutations strongly diminished Ca(V)2.1 regulation, whereas downstream perturbations had limited effects. Furthermore, our Ca(V)2 structures closely resemble published Ca(2+)/CaM-Ca(V)1.2 IQ structures, arguing against Ca(V)1/2 regulatory differences based solely on contrasting CaM/IQ conformations. Instead, alanine scanning of the Ca(V)2.1 IQ domain, combined with structure-based molecular simulation of corresponding CaM/IQ binding energy perturbations, suggests that the C lobe of CaM partially dislodges from the IQ element during channel regulation, allowing exposed IQ residues to trigger regulation via isoform-specific interactions with alternative channel regions."
19561081,0,Cell,413066,2008,Resolution of sister centromeres requires RanBP2-mediated SUMOylation of topoisomerase IIalpha.,"RanBP2 is a nucleoporin with SUMO E3 ligase activity that functions in both nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitosis. However, the biological relevance of RanBP2 and the in vivo targets of its E3 ligase activity are unknown. Here we show that animals with low amounts of RanBP2 develop severe aneuploidy in the absence of overt transport defects. The main chromosome segregation defect in cells from these mice is anaphase-bridge formation. Topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha), which decatenates sister centromeres prior to anaphase onset to prevent bridges, fails to accumulate at inner centromeres when RanBP2 levels are low. We find that RanBP2 sumoylates Topo IIalpha in mitosis and that this modification is required for its proper localization to inner centromeres. Furthermore, mice with low amounts of RanBP2 are highly sensitive to tumor formation. Together, these data identify RanBP2 as a chromosomal instability gene that regulates Topo IIalpha by sumoylation and suppresses tumorigenesis."
19561095,0,Cancer Cell,101130617,2008,Feedback circuit among INK4 tumor suppressors constrains human glioblastoma development.,"We have developed a nonheuristic genome topography scan (GTS) algorithm to characterize the patterns of genomic alterations in human glioblastoma (GBM), identifying frequent p18(INK4C) and p16(INK4A) codeletion. Functional reconstitution of p18(INK4C) in GBM cells null for both p16(INK4A) and p18(INK4C) resulted in impaired cell-cycle progression and tumorigenic potential. Conversely, RNAi-mediated depletion of p18(INK4C) in p16(INK4A)-deficient primary astrocytes or established GBM cells enhanced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, acute suppression of p16(INK4A) in primary astrocytes induced a concomitant increase in p18(INK4C). Together, these findings uncover a feedback regulatory circuit in the astrocytic lineage and demonstrate a bona fide tumor suppressor role for p18(INK4C) in human GBM wherein it functions cooperatively with other INK4 family members to constrain inappropriate proliferation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Presecretory oxidation, aggregation, and autophagic destruction of apoprotein-B: a pathway for late-stage quality control.","Hepatic secretion of apolipoprotein-B (apoB), the major protein of atherogenic lipoproteins, is regulated through posttranslational degradation. We reported a degradation pathway, post-ER pre secretory proteolysis (PERPP), that is increased by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated within hepatocytes from dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We now report the molecular processes by which PUFA-derived ROS regulate PERPP of apoB. ApoB exits the ER; undergoes limited oxidant-dependent aggregation; and then, upon exit from the Golgi, becomes extensively oxidized and converted into large aggregates. The aggregates slowly degrade by an autophagic process. None of the oxidized, aggregated material leaves cells, thereby preventing export of apoB-lipoproteins containing potentially toxic lipid peroxides. In summary, apoB secretory control via PERPP/autophagosomes is likely a key component of normal and pathologic regulation of plasma apoB levels, as well as a means for remarkably late-stage quality control of a secreted protein."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The conserved Wobble uridine tRNA thiolase Ctu1-Ctu2 is required to maintain genome integrity.,"Modified nucleosides close to the anticodon are important for the proper decoding of mRNA by the ribosome. Particularly, the uridine at the first anticodon position (U34) of glutamate, lysine, and glutamine tRNAs is universally thiolated (S(2)U34), which is proposed to be crucial for both restriction of wobble in the corresponding split codon box and efficient codon-anticodon interaction. Here we show that the highly conserved complex Ctu1-Ctu2 (cytosolic thiouridylase) is responsible for the 2-thiolation of cytosolic tRNAs in the nematode and fission yeast. In both species, inactivation of the complex leads to loss of thiolation on tRNAs and to a thermosensitive decrease of viability associated with marked ploidy abnormalities and aberrant development. Increased level of the corresponding tRNAs suppresses the fission yeast defects, and our data suggest that these defects could result from both misreading and frame shifting during translation. Thus, a translation defect due to unmodified tRNAs results in severe genome instability."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Identification of a potent synthetic FXR agonist with an unexpected mode of binding and activation.,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, plays important roles in the regulation of bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. There is intense interest in understanding the mechanisms of FXR regulation and in developing pharmaceutically suitable synthetic FXR ligands that might be used to treat metabolic syndrome. We report here the identification of a potent FXR agonist (MFA-1) and the elucidation of the structure of this ligand in ternary complex with the human receptor and a coactivator peptide fragment using x-ray crystallography at 1.9-A resolution. The steroid ring system of MFA-1 binds with its D ring-facing helix 12 (AF-2) in a manner reminiscent of hormone binding to classical steroid hormone receptors and the reverse of the pose adopted by naturally occurring bile acids when bound to FXR. This binding mode appears to be driven by the presence of a carboxylate on MFA-1 that is situated to make a salt-bridge interaction with an arginine residue in the FXR-binding pocket that is normally used to neutralize bound bile acids. Receptor activation by MFA-1 differs from that by bile acids in that it relies on direct interactions between the ligand and residues in helices 11 and 12 and only indirectly involves a protonated histidine that is part of the activation trigger. The structure of the FXR:MFA-1 complex differs significantly from that of the complex with a structurally distinct agonist, fexaramine, highlighting the inherent plasticity of the receptor."

Ad5 vectors infect liver cells in vivo with high efficiency via a poorly defined mechanism, which involves virus binding to vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors. Here, we report that the major Ad5 capsid protein, hexon, binds human coagulation factor X (FX) with an affinity of 229 pM. This affinity is 40-fold stronger than the reported affinity of Ad5 fiber for the cellular receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, CAR. Cryoelectron microscopy and single-particle image reconstruction revealed that the FX attachment site is localized to the central depression at the top of the hexon trimer. Hexon-mutated virus bearing a large insertion in hexon showed markedly reduced FX binding in vitro and failed to deliver a transgene to hepatocytes in vivo. This study describes the mechanism of FX binding to Ad5 and demonstrates the critical role of hexon for virus infection of hepatocytes in vivo."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,An insulin-like peptide regulates egg maturation and metabolism in the mosquito Aedes aegypti.,"Ingestion of vertebrate blood is essential for egg maturation and transmission of disease-causing parasites by female mosquitoes. Prior studies with the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, indicated blood feeding stimulates egg production by triggering the release of hormones from medial neurosecretory cells in the mosquito brain. The ability of bovine insulin to stimulate a similar response further suggested this trigger is an endogenous insulin-like peptide (ILP). A. aegypti encodes eight predicted ILPs. Here, we report that synthetic ILP3 dose-dependently stimulated yolk uptake by oocytes and ecdysteroid production by the ovaries at lower concentrations than bovine insulin. ILP3 also exhibited metabolic activity by elevating carbohydrate and lipid storage. Binding studies using ovary membranes indicated that ILP3 had an IC(50) value of 5.9 nM that was poorly competed by bovine insulin. Autoradiography and immunoblotting studies suggested that ILP3 binds the mosquito insulin receptor (MIR), whereas loss-of-function experiments showed that ILP3 activity requires MIR expression. Overall, our results identify ILP3 as a critical regulator of egg production by A. aegypti."

This is linked with blast transformation. It is believed that the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6) is involved in the regulation of cell cycle entry. However, the possible mechanism of this regulation is not approached. In our current study, we found that EBNA-6 binds to a MRPS18-2 protein, and targets it to the nucleus. We found that MRPS18-2 binds to both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of Rb protein specifically. This binding targets the small pocket of pRb, which is a site of interaction with E2F1. The MRPS18-2 competes with the binding of E2F1 to pRb, thereby raising the level of free E2F1. Our experimental data suggest that EBNA-6 may play a major role in the entry of EBV infected B cells into the S phase by binding to and raising the level of nuclear MRPS18-2, protein. This would inhibit pRb binding to E2F1 competitively and lift the block preventing S-phase entry."
19561645,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Structure of tumor suppressor p53 and its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain.,"Proteins with intrinsically disordered domains are implicated in a vast range of biological processes, especially in cell signaling and regulation. Having solved the quaternary structure of the folded domains in the tumor suppressor p53 by a multidisciplinary approach, we have now determined the average ensemble structure of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) by using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from NMR spectroscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Remarkably, not only were we able to measure RDCs of the isolated TAD, but we were also able to do so for the TAD in both the full-length tetrameric p53 protein and in its complex with a specific DNA response element. We determined the orientation of the TAD ensemble relative to the core domain, found that the TAD was stiffer in the proline-rich region (residues 64-92), which has a tendency to adopt a polyproline II (PPII) structure, and projected the TAD away from the core. We located the TAD in SAXS experiments on a complex between tetrameric p53 and four Taz2 domains that bind tightly to the TAD (residues 1-57) and acted as &quot;reporters.&quot; The p53-Taz2 complex was an extended cross-shaped structure. The quality of the SAXS data enabled us to model the disordered termini and the folded domains in the complex with DNA. The core domains enveloped the response element in the center of the molecule, with the Taz2-bound TADs projecting outward from the core."
19562033,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,TFIID component TAF7 functionally interacts with both TFIIH and P-TEFb.,"Transcription consists of a series of highly regulated steps: assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter, initiation, elongation, and termination. PIC assembly is nucleated by TFIID, a complex composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a series of TBP-associated factors (TAFs). One component, TAF7, is incorporated in the PIC through its interaction with TFIID but is released from TFIID upon transcription initiation. We now report that TAF7 interacts with the transcription factors, TFIIH and P-TEFb, resulting in the inhibition of their Pol II CTD kinase activities. Importantly, in in vitro transcription reactions, TAF7 inhibits steps after PIC assembly and formation of the first phosphodiester bonds. Further, in vivo TAF7 coelongates with P-TEFb and Pol II downstream of the promoter. We propose a model in which TAF7 contributes to the regulation of the transition from PIC assembly to initiation and elongation."
19562802,1,Plant Physiol.,401224,2008,LEUNIG_HOMOLOG and LEUNIG perform partially redundant functions during Arabidopsis embryo and floral development.,"Transcription corepressors play important roles in animal and plant development. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), LEUNIG (LUG) and LEUNIG_HOMOLOG (LUH) encode two highly homologous proteins that are similar to the animal and fungal Gro/Tup1-type corepressors. LUG was previously shown to form a putative corepressor complex with another protein, SEUSS (SEU), and to repress the transcription of AGAMOUS in floral organ identity specification. However, the function of LUH is completely unknown. Here, we show that single luh loss-of-function mutants develop normal flowers, but lug; luh double mutants are embryo lethal, uncovering a previously unknown function of LUG and LUH in embryonic development. In addition, luh/+ enhances the floral phenotype of lug, revealing a minor role of LUH in flower development. Functional diversification between LUH and LUG is evidenced by the inability of 35S::LUH overexpression to rescue lug mutants and by the opposite expression trends of LUG and LUH in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The luh-1 mutation does not enhance the defect of seu in flower development, but LUH could directly interact with SEU in yeast. We propose a model that explains the complex relationships among LUH, LUG, and SEU. As most eukaryotes have undergone at least one round of whole-genome duplication during evolution, gene duplication and functional diversification are important issues to consider in uncovering gene function. Our study provides important insights into the complexity in the relationship between two highly homologous paralogous genes."
19563754,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Phosducin-Like Protein 3 is required for microtubule-dependent steps of cell division but not for meristem growth in Arabidopsis.,"Given the central role of cell division in meristems, one might expect meristem growth to be regulated by mitotic checkpoints, including checkpoints for correct microtubule function. Here, we studied the role of two close Phosducin-Like Protein 3 homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana (PLP3a and PLP3b) in the microtubule assembly pathway and determined the consequences of inhibiting PLP3a and PLP3b expression in the meristem. PLP3 function is essential in Arabidopsis: impairing PLP3a and PLP3b expression disrupted microtubule arrays and caused polyploidy, aneuploidy, defective cytokinesis, and disoriented cell growth. Consistent with a role in microtubule formation, PLP3a interacted with beta-tubulin in the yeast two-hybrid assay and, when overexpressed, increased resistance to drugs that inhibit tubulin polymerization. Inhibition of PLP3 function targeted to the meristem caused severe mitotic defects, but the cells carried on cycling through DNA replication and abortive cytokinesis. Thus, we showed that PLP3 is involved in microtubule formation in Arabidopsis and provided genetic evidence that cell viability and growth in the meristem are not subordinate to successful completion of microtubule-dependent steps of cell division."
19563760,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of the tumour suppressor p33(ING1b).,"The tumour suppressor p33(ING1b) ((ING1b) for inhibitor of growth family, member 1b) is important in cellular stress responses, including cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, chromatin remodelling and DNA repair; however, its degradation pathway is still unknown. Recently, we showed that genotoxic stress induces p33(ING1b) phosphorylation at Ser 126, and abolishment of Ser 126 phosphorylation markedly shortened its half-life. Therefore, we suggest that Ser 126 phosphorylation modulates the interaction of p33(ING1b) with its degradation machinery, stabilizing this protein. Combining the use of inhibitors of the main degradation pathways in the nucleus (proteasome and calpains), partial isolation of the proteasome complex, and in vitro interaction and degradation assays, we set out to determine the degradation mechanism of p33(ING1b). We found that p33(ING1b) is degraded in the 20S proteasome and that NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), an oxidoreductase previously shown to modulate the degradation of p53 in the 20S proteasome, inhibits the degradation of p33(ING1b). Furthermore, ultraviolet irradiation induces p33(ING1b) phosphorylation at Ser 126, which, in turn, facilitates its interaction with NQO1."
19564030,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Arabidopsis COP1 shapes the temporal pattern of CO accumulation conferring a photoperiodic flowering response.,"The transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) promotes flowering of Arabidopsis under long summer days (LDs) but not under short winter days (SDs). Post-translational regulation of CO is crucial for this response by stabilizing the protein at the end of a LD, whereas promoting its degradation throughout the night under LD and SD. We show that mutations in CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a component of a ubiquitin ligase, cause extreme early flowering under SDs, and that this is largely dependent on CO activity. Furthermore, transcription of the CO target gene FT is increased in cop1 mutants and decreased in plants overexpressing COP1 in phloem companion cells. COP1 and CO interact in vivo and in vitro through the C-terminal region of CO. COP1 promotes CO degradation mainly in the dark, so that in cop1 mutants CO protein but not CO mRNA abundance is dramatically increased during the night. However, in the morning CO degradation occurs independently of COP1 by a phytochrome B-dependent mechanism. Thus, COP1 contributes to day length perception by reducing the abundance of CO during the night and thereby delaying flowering under SDs."

However, the mechanisms underlying fundamental properties of TRPP2 regulation, such as channel gating and activation, are unknown. We have shown that TRPP2 was activated by EGF and physically interacted with the mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1), a downstream effector of RhoA. Now, we show that mDia1 regulates TRPP2 by specifically blocking its activity at negative but not positive potentials. The voltage-dependent unblock of TRPP2 by mDia1 at positive potentials is mediated through RhoA-induced molecular switching of mDia1 from its autoinhibited state at negative potentials to its activated state at positive potentials. Under physiological resting potentials, EGF activates TRPP2 by releasing the mDia1-dependent block through the activation of RhoA. Our data reveal a new role of mDia1 in the regulation of ion channels and suggest a molecular basis for the voltage-dependent gating of TRP channels."

Two opposing models describe the role of GTP and its relationship to conformational change in alphabeta-tubulin. The allosteric model posits that unpolymerized alphabeta-tubulin adopts a more polymerization-competent conformation upon GTP binding. The lattice model posits that conformational changes occur only upon recruitment into the growing lattice. Published data support a lattice model, but are largely indirect and so the allosteric model has prevailed. We present two independent solution probes of the conformation of alphabeta-tubulin, the 2.3 A crystal structure of gamma-tubulin bound to GDP, and kinetic simulations to interpret the functional consequences of the structural data. These results (with our previous gamma-tubulin:GTPgammaS structure) support the lattice model by demonstrating that major domain rearrangements do not occur in eukaryotic tubulins in response to GTP binding, and that the unpolymerized conformation of alphabeta-tubulin differs significantly from the polymerized one. Thus, geometric constraints of lateral self-assembly must drive alphabeta-tubulin conformational changes, whereas GTP plays a secondary role to tune the strength of longitudinal contacts within the microtubule lattice. alphabeta-Tubulin behaves like a bent spring, resisting straightening until forced to do so by GTP-mediated interactions with the growing microtubule. Kinetic simulations demonstrate that resistance to straightening opposes microtubule initiation by specifically destabilizing early assembly intermediates that are especially sensitive to the strength of lateral interactions. These data provide new insights into the molecular origins of dynamic microtubule behavior."

Here, we have identified cortactin, a central regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, as a substrate of PTP1B. A trapping mutant of PTP1B binds cortactin at the phosphorylation site Tyr(446), the regulation and function of which have not previously been characterized. We show that phosphorylation of cortactin Tyr(446) is induced by hyperosmolarity and potentiates apoptotic signaling during prolonged hyperosmotic stress. This study advances the importance of Tyr(446) in the regulation of cortactin and provides a potential mechanism to explain the effects of PTP1B on processes including cell adhesion, migration, and tumorigenesis."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The role of filament-packing dynamics in powering amoeboid cell motility.,"Although several models have been proposed to account for how cytoskeleton polymerization drives protrusion in cell motility, the precise mechanism remains controversial. Here, we show that, in addition to force exerted directly against the membrane by growing filaments, the way elongating filaments pack also contributes to protrusion by generating an expansion of the cytoskeleton gel. Tomography shows that filament packing in the major sperm protein (MSP) -based nematode sperm-motility machinery resembles that observed with rigid rods. Maximum rod-packing density decreases dramatically as the rods lengthen. Therefore, as filaments elongate, the cytoskeleton gel expands to accommodate their packing less densely. This volume expansion combines with polymerization to drive protrusion. Consistent with this hypothesis, an engineered MSP mutant that generates shorter filaments shows higher filament-packing density and slower movement."

In addition to its role in endoproteolysis of APP, BACE1 participates in the proteolytic processing of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and influences the myelination of central and peripheral axons. Although NRG1 has been genetically linked to schizophrenia and NRG1(+/-) mice exhibit a number of schizophrenia-like behavioral traits, it is not known whether altered BACE1-dependent NRG1 signaling can cause similar behavioral abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the behaviors considered to be rodent analogs of clinical features of schizophrenia in BACE1(-/-) mice with impaired processing of NRG1. We demonstrate that BACE1(-/-) mice exhibit deficits in prepulse inhibition, novelty-induced hyperactivity, hypersensitivity to a glutamatergic psychostimulant (MK-801), cognitive impairments, and deficits in social recognition. Importantly, some of these manifestations were responsive to treatment with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug. Moreover, although the total amount of ErbB4, a receptor for NRG1 was not changed, binding of ErbB4 with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) was significantly reduced in the brains of BACE1(-/-) mice. Consistent with the role of ErbB4 in spine morphology and synaptic function, BACE1(-/-) mice displayed reduced spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Collectively, our findings suggest that alterations in BACE1-dependent NRG1/ErbB4 signaling may participate in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders."

We analyzed the upstream signaling of Xenopus Rax (also known as Rx1) and identified the Otx2 and Sox2 proteins as direct upstream regulators of Rax. We revealed that endogenous Otx2 and Sox2 proteins bound to the conserved noncoding sequence (CNS1) located approximately 2 kb upstream of the Rax promoter. This sequence is conserved among vertebrates and is required for potent transcriptional activity. Reporter assays showed that Otx2 and Sox2 synergistically activated transcription via CNS1. Furthermore, the Otx2 and Sox2 proteins physically interacted with each other, and this interaction was affected by the Sox2-missense mutations identified in these ocular disorders. These results demonstrate that the direct interaction and interdependence between the Otx2 and Sox2 proteins coordinate Rax expression in eye development, providing molecular linkages among the genes responsible for ocular malformation."

Here, we show that LRP6 is palmitoylated on a juxtamembranous cysteine and that palmitoylation is required for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We propose that palmitoylation serves to tilt the long, 23-residue transmembrane domain of LRP6 with respect to the plane of membrane to prevent a hydrophobic mismatch and subsequent recognition by the ER quality control. In support of this model, a palmitoylation-deficient LRP6 mutant could be rescued from ER retention by deletion of two to four residues in the transmembrane domain. Importantly, we found that palmitoylation-deficient LRP6 was retained in the ER by a completely novel monoubiquitination-dependent ER retention mechanism. Mutation of a specific lysine indeed abolished ubiquitination of palmitoylation-deficient LRP6 and led to a rescue from ER retention. Finally, at the cell surface, we found that interplay between palmitoylation and ubiquitination was necessary for efficient Wnt signaling."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,In vivo functions of the proprotein convertase PC5/6 during mouse development: Gdf11 is a likely substrate.,"The proprotein convertase PC5/6 cleaves protein precursors after basic amino acids and is essential for implantation in CD1/129/Sv/C57BL/6 mixed-background mice. Conditional inactivation of Pcsk5 in the epiblast but not in the extraembryonic tissue bypassed early embryonic lethality but resulted in death at birth. PC5/6-deficient embryos exhibited Gdf11-related phenotypes such as altered anteroposterior patterning with extra vertebrae and lack of tail and kidney agenesis. They also exhibited Gdf11-independent phenotypes, such as a smaller size, multiple hemorrhages, collapsed alveoli, and retarded ossification. In situ hybridization revealed overlapping PC5/6 and Gdf11 mRNA expression patterns. In vitro and ex vivo analyses showed that the selectivity of PC5/6 for Gdf11 essentially resides in the presence of a P1' Asn in the RSRR downward arrowN cleavage motif. This work identifies Gdf11 as a likely in vivo specific substrate of PC5/6 and opens the way to the identification of other key substrates of this convertase."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Human glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand regulates its signaling activity through multiple oligomerization states.,"Ligation between glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) and its ligand (GITRL) provides an undefined signal that renders CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells. To understand the structural basis of GITRL function, we have expressed and purified the extracellular domain of human GITR ligand in Escherichia coli. Chromotography and cross-linking studies indicate that human GITRL (hGITRL) exists as dimers and trimers in solution and also can form a supercluster. To gain insight into the nature of GITRL oligomerization, we determined the crystallographic structures of hGITRL, which revealed a loosely associated open trimer with a deep cavity at the molecular center and a flexible C-terminal tail bent for trimerization. Moreover, a tetramer of trimers (i.e., supercluster) has also been observed in the crystal, consistent with the cross-linking analysis. Deletion of the C-terminal distal three residues disrupts the loosely assembled trimer and favors the formation of a dimer that has compromised receptor binding and signaling activity. Collectively, our studies identify multiple oligomeric species of hGITRL that possess distinct kinetics of ERK activation. The studies address the functional implications and structural models for a process by which hGITRL utilizes multiple oligomerization states to regulate GITR-mediated signaling during T cell costimulation."

We previously reported that DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI), also referred to as DLM-1/ZBP1, functions as a DNA sensor that activates the innate immune system. In the present study, we examined the regulation of the complex DNA-sensing system by DAI and other molecules. We first show that DAI directly interacts with DNA in vitro and that it requires three DNA-binding domains for full activation in vivo. We also show that the artificially induced dimerization of DAI results in the DNA-independent activation of type I IFN genes, thereby providing a better understanding for the molecular basis of DAI activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the presence of additional DNA sensors, either positively or negatively regulating cytosolic DNA-mediated innate immune responses. These results in toto provide insights into the mechanism of DAI activation and reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying DNA-mediated protective and pathologic immune responses."

The molecular mechanisms underlying SYVN1 regulation of cell death are largely unknown. Here, we report that elevated SYVN1 expression correlates with decreased levels of the protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-a pro-apoptotic factor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced apoptosis pathway-in synovial fibroblasts from mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). SYVN1 interacts with and catalyses IRE1 ubiquitination and consequently promotes IRE1 degradation. Suppression of SYVN1 expression in synovial fibroblasts from CIA mice restores IRE1 protein expression and reverses the resistance of ER-stress-induced apoptosis of CIA synovial fibroblasts. These results show that SYVN1 causes the overgrowth of synovial cells by degrading IRE1, and therefore antagonizes ER-stress-induced cell death."
19570982,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 positively regulates epithelial cell migration.,"Cell migration requires integration of signals arising from both the extracellular matrix and messengers acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We find that increased levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), a key player in GPCR regulation, potentiate migration of epithelial cells towards fibronectin, whereas such process is decreased in embryonic fibroblasts from hemizygous GRK2 mice or upon knockdown of GRK2 expression. Interestingly, the GRK2 effect on fibronectin-mediated cell migration involves the paracrine/autocrine activation of a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) Gi-coupled GPCR. GRK2 positively modulates the activity of the Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK pathway in response to adhesion and S1P by a mechanism involving the phosphorylation-dependent, dynamic interaction of GRK2 with GIT1, a key scaffolding protein in cell migration processes. Furthermore, decreased GRK2 levels in hemizygous mice result in delayed wound healing rate in vivo, consistent with a physiological role of GRK2 as a regulator of coordinated integrin and GPCR-directed epithelial cell migration."
19570985,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,The kinase Syk as an adaptor controlling sustained calcium signalling and B-cell development.,"Upon B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation, the protein tyrosine kinase Syk phosphorylates the adaptor protein SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa (SLP-65), thus coupling the BCR to diverse signalling pathways. Here, we report that SLP-65 is not only a downstream target and substrate of Syk but also a direct binding-partner and activator of this kinase. This positive feedback is mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of SLP-65 to an autophosphorylated tyrosine of Syk. The mutant B cells that cannot form the Syk/SLP-65 complex are defective in BCR-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase, nuclear factor kappa B and nuclear factor of activated T cells, but not Akt activation, and are blocked in B-cell development. Furthermore, we show that formation of the Syk/SLP-65 complex is required for sustained Ca(2+) responses in activated B cells. We suggest that after activation and internalization of the BCR, Syk remains active as part of a membrane-bound Syk/SLP-65 complex controlling sustained signalling and calcium influx."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,MKP-1 inhibits high NaCl-induced activation of p38 but does not inhibit the activation of TonEBP/OREBP: opposite roles of p38alpha and p38delta.,"High NaCl rapidly activates p38 MAPK by phosphorylating it, the phosphorylation presumably being regulated by a balance of kinases and phosphatases. Kinases are known, but the phosphatases are uncertain. Our initial purpose was to identify the phosphatases. We find that in HEK293 cells transient overexpression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a dual-specificity phosphatase, inhibits high NaCl-induced phosphorylation of p38, and that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of MKP-1 does the opposite. High NaCl lowers MKP-1 activity by increasing reactive oxygen species, which directly inhibit MKP-1, and by reducing binding of MKP-1 to p38. Because inhibition of p38 is reported to reduce hypertonicity-induced activation of the osmoprotective transcription factor, TonEBP/OREBP, we anticipated that MKP-1 expression might also. However, overexpression of MKP-1 has no significant effect on Ton EBP/OREBP activity. This paradox is explained by opposing effects of p38alpha and p38delta, both of which are activated by high NaCl and inhibited by MKP-1. Thus, we find that overexpression of p38alpha increases high NaCl-induced TonEBP/OREBP activity, but overexpression of p38delta reduces it. Also, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38delta enhances the activation of TonEBP/OREBP. We conclude that high NaCl inhibits MKP-1, which contributes to the activation of p38. However, opposing actions of p38alpha and p38delta negate any effect on TonEBP/OREBP activity. Thus, activation of p38 isoforms by hypertonicity does not contribute to activation of TonEBP/OREBP because of opposing effects of p38alpha and p38delta, and effects of inhibitors of p38 depend on which isoform is affected, which can be misleading."
19571127,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Phosphorylation-independent regulation of the diguanylate cyclase WspR.,"Environmental signals that trigger bacterial pathogenesis and biofilm formation are mediated by changes in the level of cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a unique eubacterial second messenger. Tight regulation of cellular c-di-GMP concentration is governed by diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases, which are responsible for its production and degradation, respectively. Here, we present the crystal structure of the diguanylate cyclase WspR, a conserved GGDEF domain-containing response regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, bound to c-di-GMP at an inhibitory site. Biochemical analyses revealed that feedback regulation involves the formation of at least three distinct oligomeric states. By switching from an active to a product-inhibited dimer via a tetrameric assembly, WspR utilizes a novel mechanism for modulation of its activity through oligomerization. Moreover, our data suggest that these enzymes can be activated by phosphodiesterases. Thus, in addition to the canonical pathways via phosphorylation of the regulatory domains, both product and enzyme concentration contribute to the coordination of c-di-GMP signaling. A structural comparison reveals resemblance of the oligomeric states to assemblies of GAF domains, widely used regulatory domains in signaling molecules conserved from archaea to mammals, suggesting a similar mechanism of regulation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Interconversion between two unrelated protein folds in the lymphotactin native state.,"Proteins often have multiple functional states, which might not always be accommodated by a single fold. Lymphotactin (Ltn) adopts two distinct structures in equilibrium, one corresponding to the canonical chemokine fold consisting of a monomeric three-stranded beta-sheet and carboxyl-terminal helix. The second Ltn structure solved by NMR reveals a dimeric all-beta-sheet arrangement with no similarity to other known proteins. In physiological solution conditions, both structures are significantly populated and interconvert rapidly. Interconversion replaces long-range interactions that stabilize the chemokine fold with an entirely new set of tertiary and quaternary contacts. The chemokine-like Ltn conformation is a functional XCR1 agonist, but fails to bind heparin. In contrast, the alternative structure binds glycosaminoglycans with high affinity but fails to activate XCR1. Because each structural species displays only one of the two functional properties essential for activity in vivo, the conformational equilibrium is likely to be essential for the biological activity of lymphotactin. These results demonstrate that the functional repertoire and regulation of a single naturally occurring amino acid sequence can be expanded by access to a set of highly dissimilar native-state structures."

In this article, we show an unexpected connection between two proteins that participate in different processes of posttranscriptional regulation that ensures the production of functional mRNA molecules. Specifically, we show that the A-to-I RNA editing protein adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and the human Upf1 (hUpf1) protein involved in RNA surveillance are found associated within nuclear RNA-splicing complexes. A potential functional role for this association was revealed by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of ADAR1, which was accompanied by up-regulation of a number of genes previously shown to undergo A-to-I editing in Alu repeats and to be down-regulated by hUpf1. This study suggests a regulatory pathway by a combination of ADAR1 A-to-I editing enzyme and RNA degradation presumably with the aid of hUpf1."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying Ku70-dependent inhibition of Bax is not fully understood. Here, we show that the absence of Ku70 results in the accumulation of ubiquitylated Bax. Under normal growth conditions, Bax ubiquitylation promotes its degradation. Upon induction of apoptosis in wild-type cells, a significant reduction in the levels of ubiquitylated Bax was observed, whereas in Ku70(-/-) cells, the ubiquitylated Bax was robustly accumulated. Addition of recombinant Ku70 into a protein extract of Ku70(-/-) cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of ubiquitylated Bax, even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, an in vitro deubiquitylation assay demonstrated that recombinant Ku70 hydrolyzed polyubiquitin chains into monoubiquitin units. Thus, Ku70 regulates apoptosis by sequestering Bax from the mitochondria and mediating Bax deubiquitylation. These results shed light on the role of proteasome inhibitors as tumor suppressors."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Molecular basis of thrombin recognition by protein C inhibitor revealed by the 1.6-A structure of the heparin-bridged complex.,"Protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a serpin with many roles in biology, including a dual role as pro- and anticoagulant in blood. The protease specificity and local function of PCI depend on its interaction with cofactors such as heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and thrombomodulin (TM). Both cofactors significantly increase the rate of thrombin inhibition, but GAGs serve to promote the anticoagulant activity of PCI, and TM promotes its procoagulant function. To gain insight into how PCI recognition of thrombin is aided by these cofactors, we determined a crystallographic structure of the Michaelis complex of PCI, thrombin, and heparin to 1.6 A resolution. Thrombin interacts with PCI in an unusual fashion that depends on the length of PCI's reactive center loop (RCL) to align the heparin-binding sites of the two proteins. The principal exosite contact is engendered by movement of thrombin's 60-loop in response to the unique P2 Phe of PCI. This mechanism of communication between the active site of thrombin and its recognition exosite is previously uncharacterized and may relate to other thrombin substrate-cofactor interactions. The cofactor activity of heparin thus depends on the formation of a heparin-bridged Michaelis complex and substrate-induced exosite contacts. We also investigated the cofactor effect of TM, establishing that TM bridges PCI to thrombin through additional direct interactions. A model of the PCI-thrombin-TM complex was built and evaluated by mutagenesis and suggests distinct binding sites for heparin and TM on PCI. These data significantly improve our understanding of the cofactor-dependent roles of PCI in hemostasis."

The predominant view has been that it facilitates the movement of ammonium in its uncharged form as indicated by the hydrophobic nature of a pore located in the center of each subunit of the homotrimer. Using site-directed mutagenesis and a combination of biochemical and crystallographic methods, we have investigated mechanistic questions concerning the putative periplasmic ammonium ion binding site S1 and the adjacent periplasmic &quot;gate&quot; formed by two highly conserved phenylalanine residues, F107 and F215. Our results challenge models that propose that NH(4)(+) deprotonation takes place at S1 before NH(3) conduction through the pore. The presence of S1 confers two critical features on AmtB, both essential for its function: ammonium scavenging efficiency at very low ammonium concentration and selectivity against water and physiologically important cations. We show that AmtB activity absolutely requires F215 but not F107 and that removal or obstruction of the phenylalanine gate produces an open but inactive channel. The phenyl ring of F215 must thus play a very specific role in promoting transfer and deprotonation of substrate from S1 to the central pore. We discuss these results with respect to three distinct mechanisms of conduction that have been considered so far. We conclude that substrate deprotonation is an essential part of the conduction mechanism, but we do not rule out net electrogenic transport."

We have determined the crystal structure of LepA from Escherichia coli at 2.8-A resolution. The high degree of sequence identity between LepA and EF-G is reflected in the structural similarity between the individual homologous domains of LepA and EF-G. However, the orientation of domains III and V in LepA differs from their orientations in EF-G. LepA also contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) not found in EF-G that has a previously unobserved protein fold. The high structural similarity between LepA and EF-G enabled us to derive a homology model for LepA bound to the ribosome using a 7.3-A cryo-EM structure of a complex between EF-G and the 70S ribosome. In this model, the very electrostatically positive CTD of LepA is placed in the direct vicinity of the A site of the large ribosomal subunit, suggesting a possible interaction between the CTD and the back translocated tRNA or 23S rRNA."

Although it is known that Hh signaling activates the expression of genes involved in cell growth, the precise role of the Hh pathway in cancer development is still unclear. Here, we show that constitutively activated mutants of Smoothened (Smo), a transducer of the Hh signaling pathway, inhibit the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This inhibition was also observed in the presence of Hh ligand or with the overexpression of the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2, downstream effectors of Smo, indicating that this inhibition is specific for the Hh pathway. We also report that Smo mutants augment p53 binding to the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2 and promote p53 ubiquitination. Furthermore, Hh signaling induced the phosphorylation of human Mdm2 protein on serines 166 and 186, which are activating phosphorylation sites of Mdm2. Smo mutants enhanced the proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) while inducing a DNA-damage response. Moreover, Smo partially inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth inhibition in oncogene-expressing MEFs. We also found that accumulation of p53 is inhibited by Hh signaling in several human cancer cell lines. Therefore, the Hh pathway may be a powerful accelerator of oncogenesis by activating cell proliferation and inhibiting the p53-mediated anti-cancer barrier induced by oncogenic stress."

In C. elegans, reductions in IIS increase stress resistance and longevity, effects that require the IIS-inhibited FOXO protein DAF-16. The C. elegans transcription factor SKN-1 also defends against oxidative stress by mobilizing the conserved phase 2 detoxification response. Here we show that IIS not only opposes DAF-16 but also directly inhibits SKN-1 in parallel. The IIS kinases AKT-1, -2, and SGK-1 phosphorylate SKN-1, and reduced IIS leads to constitutive SKN-1 nuclear accumulation in the intestine and SKN-1 target gene activation. SKN-1 contributes to the increased stress tolerance and longevity resulting from reduced IIS and delays aging when expressed transgenically. Furthermore, SKN-1 that is constitutively active increases life span independently of DAF-16. Our findings indicate that the transcription network regulated by SKN-1 promotes longevity and is an important direct target of IIS."
19573927,0,Cell,413066,2008,Identification of ATPases pontin and reptin as telomerase components essential for holoenzyme assembly.,"Telomerase is a multisubunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that adds telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Three essential telomerase components have been identified thus far: the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the telomerase RNA component (TERC), and the TERC-binding protein dyskerin. Few other proteins are known to be required for human telomerase function, limiting our understanding of both telomerase regulation and mechanisms of telomerase action. Here, we identify the ATPases pontin and reptin as telomerase components through affinity purification of TERT from human cells. Pontin interacts directly with both TERT and dyskerin, and the amount of TERT bound to pontin and reptin peaks in S phase, evidence for cell-cycle-dependent regulation of TERT. Depletion of pontin and reptin markedly impairs telomerase RNP accumulation, indicating an essential role in telomerase assembly. These findings reveal an unanticipated requirement for additional enzymes in telomerase biogenesis and suggest alternative approaches for inhibiting telomerase in cancer."

We have recently found that enforced expression of Cdc6, the assembler of prereplicative complexes, markedly advances recovery from the prolonged S-phase arrest and reactivation of Cdk2 despite the presence of a high level of induced p21. Here, we report that Cdc6 protein can activate p21-associated Cdk2 in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro. Consistently, Cdc6 mutated for ATPase or a putative cyclin binding motif is no longer able to activate the Cdk2 in vitro or promote reinitiation of S-phase progression and reactivation of Cdk2 in vivo. These results reveal the never anticipated function of Cdc6 and redefine its role in the control of S-phase progression in mammalian cells."

A conserved peptide motif, T1, within the DT transmembrane helix 1 mediates these interactions. Because the T1 motif is also present in the N-terminal segments of lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) in anthrax toxin, we asked whether LF entry into the cell might also be facilitated by target cell cytosolic proteins. In this study, we have used LFnDTA and its associated ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (DTA) to determine the requirements for LF translocation from the lumen of endosomal vesicles to the external medium in vitro. Although low-level release of LFnDTA from enriched endosomal vesicles occurs in the absence of added factors, translocation was enhanced by the addition of cytosolic proteins and ATP to the reaction mixture. We show by GST-LFn pull-down assays that LFn specifically interacts with at least zeta-COP and beta-COP of the COPI coatomer complex. Immunodepletion of COPI coatomer complex and associated proteins from cytosolic extracts blocks in vitro LFnDTA translocation. Translocation may be reconstituted by the addition of partially purified bovine COPI to the translocation assay mixture. Taken together, these data suggest that the delivery of LF to the cytosol requires either COPI coatomer complex or a COPI subcomplex for translocation from the endosomal lumen. This facilitated delivery appears to use a mechanism that is analogous to that of DT entry."

Among the GTFs, TFIIE recruits TFIIH to complete the PIC formation and regulates enzymatic activities of TFIIH. However, the mode of binding between TFIIE and TFIIH is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the specific binding of the C-terminal acidic domain (AC-D) of the human TFIIEalpha subunit to the pleckstrin homology domain (PH-D) of the human TFIIH p62 subunit and describe the solution structures of the free and PH-D-bound forms of AC-D. Although the flexible N-terminal acidic tail from AC-D wraps around PH-D, the core domain of AC-D also interacts with PH-D. AC-D employs an entirely novel binding mode, which differs from the amphipathic helix method used by many transcriptional activators. So the binding surface between PH-D and AC-D is much broader than the specific binding surface between PH-D and the p53 acidic fragments. From our in vitro studies, we demonstrate that this interaction could be a switch to replace p53 with TFIIE on TFIIH in transcription."

However, the precise function of MAFbx in muscle wasting has been questioned. Here, we present evidence that during muscle atrophy MAFbx targets the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit 5 (eIF3-f) for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Ectopic expression of MAFbx in myotubes induces atrophy and degradation of eIF3-f. Conversely, blockade of MAFbx expression by small hairpin RNA interference prevents eIF3-f degradation in myotubes undergoing atrophy. Furthermore, genetic activation of eIF3-f is sufficient to cause hypertrophy and to block atrophy in myotubes, whereas genetic blockade of eIF3-f expression induces atrophy in myotubes. Finally, eIF3-f induces increasing expression of muscle structural proteins and hypertrophy in both myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle. We conclude that eIF3-f is a key target that accounts for MAFbx function during muscle atrophy and has a major role in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Thus, eIF3-f seems to be an attractive therapeutic target."

In rme-4 and rab-35 mutants, yolk receptors do not accumulate on the plasma membrane as would be expected in an internalization mutant, rather the receptors are lost from cortical endosomes and accumulate in dispersed small vesicles, suggesting a defect in receptor recycling. Consistent with this, genetic tests indicate the RME-4 and RAB-35 function downstream of clathrin, upstream of RAB-7, and act synergistically with recycling regulators RAB-11 and RME-1. We find that RME-4 is a conserved DENN domain protein that binds to RAB-35 in its GDP-loaded conformation. GFP-RME-4 also physically interacts with AP-2, is enriched on clathrin-coated pits, and requires clathrin but not RAB-5 for cortical association. GFP-RAB-35 localizes to the plasma membrane and early endocytic compartments but is lost from endosomes in rme-4 mutants. We propose that RME-4 functions on coated pits and/or vesicles to recruit RAB-35, which in turn functions in the endosome to promote receptor recycling."

We find by glycan array screening that SV40 recognizes its ganglioside receptor GM1 with a quite narrow specificity, but isothermal titration calorimetry shows that individual binding sites have a relatively low affinity, with a millimolar dissociation constant. The high-resolution crystal structure of recombinantly produced SV40 capsid protein, VP1, in complex with the carbohydrate portion of GM1, reveals that the receptor is bound in a shallow solvent-exposed groove at the outer surface of the capsid. Through a complex network of interactions, VP1 recognizes a conformation of GM1 that is the dominant one in solution. Analysis of contacts provides a structural basis for the observed specificity and suggests binding mechanisms for additional physiologically relevant GM1 variants. Comparison with murine Polyomavirus (Polyoma) receptor complexes reveals that SV40 uses a different mechanism of sialic acid binding, which has implications for receptor binding of human polyomaviruses. The SV40-GM1 complex reveals a parallel to cholera toxin, which uses a similar cell entry pathway and binds GM1 in the same conformation."

A brief period of ischemia, i.e., ischemic preconditioning, affords robust protection of CA1 neurons against a subsequent more prolonged ischemic challenge. Here we show that preconditioning acts via PI3K/Akt signaling to block the ischemia-induced cascade involving mitochondrial translocation of Bad, assembly of Bad with Bcl-x(L), cleavage of Bcl-x(L) to form its prodeath fragment, DeltaN-Bcl-x(L), activation of large-conductance channels in the mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI), caspase activation, and neuronal death. These findings show how preconditioning acts to prevent the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria and to preserve the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. The specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 administered in vivo 1 h before or immediately after ischemia or up to 120 h later significantly reverses preconditioning-induced protection, indicating a requirement for sustained PI3K signaling in ischemic tolerance.

Biol.,8109087,2008,The RASSF1A tumor suppressor restrains anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome activity during the G1/S phase transition to promote cell cycle progression in human epithelial cells.,"Multiple molecular lesions in human cancers directly collaborate to deregulate proliferation and suppress apoptosis to promote tumorigenesis. The candidate tumor suppressor RASSF1A is commonly inactivated in a broad spectrum of human tumors and has been implicated as a pivotal gatekeeper of cell cycle progression. However, a mechanistic account of the role of RASSF1A gene inactivation in tumor initiation is lacking. Here we have employed loss-of-function analysis in human epithelial cells for a detailed investigation of the contribution of RASSF1 to cell cycle progression. We found that RASSF1A has dual opposing regulatory connections to G(1)/S phase cell cycle transit. RASSF1A associates with the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint protein, EWS, to limit accumulation of cyclin D1 and restrict exit from G(1). Surprisingly, we found that RASSF1A is also required to restrict SCF(betaTrCP) activity to allow G/S phase transition. This restriction is required for accumulation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor Emi1 and the concomitant block of APC/C-dependent cyclin A turnover. The consequence of this relationship is inhibition of cell cycle progression in normal epithelial cells upon RASSF1A depletion despite elevated cyclin D1 concentrations. Progression to tumorigenicity upon RASSF1A gene inactivation should therefore require collaborating genetic aberrations that bypass the consequences of impaired APC/C regulation at the G(1)/S phase cell cycle transition."
19578179,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,"Clathrin-independent endocytosis used by the IL-2 receptor is regulated by Rac1, Pak1 and Pak2.","There are several endocytic pathways, which are either dependent on or independent of clathrin. This study focuses on a poorly characterized mechanism-clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis-used by the interleukin-2 receptor beta (IL-2R beta). We address the question of its regulation in comparison with the clathrin-dependent pathway. First, we show that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) is specifically required for IL-2R beta entry, and we identify p21-activated kinases (Paks) as downstream targets. By RNA interference, we show that Pak1 and Pak2 are both necessary for IL-2R beta uptake, in contrast to the clathrin-dependent route. We observe that cortactin, a partner of actin and dynamin-two essential endocytic factors-is required for IL-2R beta uptake. Furthermore, we find that cortactin acts downstream from Paks, suggesting control of its function by these kinases. Thus, we describe a cascade composed of Rac1, Paks and cortactin specifically regulating IL-2R beta internalization. This study indicates Paks as the first specific regulators of the clathrin-independent endocytosis pathway."
19578358,0,Cardiovasc. Res.,77427,2008,Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 interacts with angiotensin II type 2 receptor and additively inhibits angiogenesis.,"AIM: The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are complex molecules with both pro- and anti-tumour effects. Thus, their diverse expression could be because of their multifunctional properties with respect to tumour growth, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and other biological functions. Previous data have shown that TIMPs bind tightly to most matrix metalloproteinases, although the pathway that mediates angiostatic activity has not been fully established. METHODS AND RESULTS: As an initial step to elucidate the mechanism that regulates TIMP-3, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human ovary cDNA library for a novel TIMP-3-interacting partner. Here, we identified human angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2) as such a partner, which is well known to be a regulator of cardiovascular homoeostasis. In this present study, we investigated whether AGTR2-mediated apoptotic activity can inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer in an experimental model system. AGTR2 treatment was found to be more effective in inhibiting ovarian cancer growth than the treatment with TIMP-3 in parallel experiments. Subsequently, the efficacy of the combined treatment with TIMP-3 and AGTR2 was investigated. In the presence of both of these proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation was additively inhibited, and the inhibition of Akt and endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation was blocked. CONCLUSION: These combined results suggest that two angiostatic molecules may have an important biological role in regulating potent anti-angiogenic effects and possibly may have a role in anti-tumour therapy."
19578361,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2008,Rictor and integrin-linked kinase interact and regulate Akt phosphorylation and cancer cell survival.,"An unbiased proteomic screen to identify integrin-linked kinase (ILK) interactors revealed rictor as an ILK-binding protein. This finding was interesting because rictor, originally identified as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, is also a component of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a complex implicated in Akt phosphorylation. These functions overlap with known ILK functions. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed this interaction, and ILK and rictor colocalized in membrane ruffles and leading edges of cancer cells. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed a direct interaction between the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal domains of rictor and the ILK kinase domain. Depletion of ILK and rictor in breast and prostate cancer cell lines resulted in inhibition of Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis, whereas, in several cell lines, depletion of mTOR increased Akt phosphorylation. Akt and Ser(473)P-Akt were detected in ILK immunoprecipitates and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of rictor, but not mTOR, inhibited the amount of Ser(473)P-Akt in the ILK complex. Expression of the NH(2)-terminal (1-398 amino acids) rictor domain also resulted in the inhibition of ILK-associated Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. These data show that rictor regulates the ability of ILK to promote Akt phosphorylation and cancer cell survival."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Protein phosphatase 2A controls the activity of histone deacetylase 7 during T cell apoptosis and angiogenesis.,"Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as key transcriptional regulators in several important developmental programs. Their activities are controlled via phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Phosphorylation of conserved serine residues triggers association with 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic relocalization of class IIa HDACs, which leads to the derepression of their target genes. Although a lot of effort has been made toward the identification of the inactivating kinases that phosphorylate class IIa HDAC 14-3-3 motifs, the existence of an antagonistic protein phosphatase remains elusive. Here we identify PP2A as a phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating the 14-3-3 binding sites in class IIa HDACs. Interestingly, dephosphorylation of class IIa HDACs by PP2A is prevented by competitive association of 14-3-3 proteins. Using both okadaic acid treatment and RNA interference, we demonstrate that PP2A constitutively dephosphorylates the class IIa member HDAC7 to control its biological functions as a regulator of T cell apoptosis and endothelial cell functions. This study unravels a dynamic interplay among 14-3-3s, protein kinases, and PP2A and provides a model for the regulation of class IIa HDACs."
19578380,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Munc18a controls SNARE assembly through its interaction with the syntaxin N-peptide.,"Sec1/Munc18-like (SM) proteins functionally interact with SNARE proteins in vesicular fusion. Despite their high sequence conservation, structurally disparate binding modes for SM proteins with syntaxins have been observed. Several SM proteins appear to bind only to a short peptide present at the N terminus of syntaxin, designated the N-peptide, while Munc18a binds to a 'closed' conformation formed by the remaining portion of syntaxin 1a. Here, we show that the syntaxin 16 N-peptide binds to the SM protein Vps45, but the remainder of syntaxin 16 strongly enhances the affinity of the interaction. Likewise, the N-peptide of syntaxin 1a serves as a second binding site in the Munc18a/syntaxin 1a complex. When the syntaxin 1a N-peptide is bound to Munc18a, SNARE complex formation is blocked. Removal of the N-peptide enables binding of syntaxin 1a to its partner SNARE SNAP-25, while still bound to Munc18a. This suggests that Munc18a controls the accessibility of syntaxin 1a to its partners, a role that might be common to all SM proteins."
19578404,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,cdc2-cyclin B regulates eEF2 kinase activity in a cell cycle- and amino acid-dependent manner.,"The calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2 kinase; eEF2K) is subject to multisite phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Phosphorylation at Ser359 inhibits eEF2K activity even at high calcium concentrations. To identify the kinase that phosphorylates Ser359 in eEF2K, we developed an extensive purification protocol. Tryptic mass fingerprint analysis identified it as cdc2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1). cdc2 co-purifies with Ser359 kinase activity and cdc2-cyclin B complexes phosphorylate eEF2K at Ser359. We demonstrate that cdc2 contributes to controlling eEF2 phosphorylation in cells. cdc2 is activated early in mitosis. Kinase activity against Ser359 in eEF2K also peaks at this stage of the cell cycle and eEF2 phosphorylation is low in mitotic cells. Inactivation of eEF2K by cdc2 may serve to keep eEF2 active during mitosis (where calcium levels rise) and thereby permit protein synthesis to proceed in mitotic cells. Amino-acid starvation decreases cdc2's activity against eEF2K, whereas loss of TSC2 (a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1)) increases it. These data closely match the control of Ser359 phosphorylation and indicate that cdc2 may be regulated by mTORC1."
19578537,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,The BTG2 protein is a general activator of mRNA deadenylation.,"BTG2 is a prototype member of the BTG/Tob family of antiproliferative proteins, originally identified as a primary response gene induced by growth factors and tumour promoters. Its expression has been linked to diverse cellular processes such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation or apoptosis. BTG2 has also been shown to interact with the Pop2/Caf1 deadenylase. Here, we demonstrate that BTG2 is a general activator of mRNA decay, thereby contributing to gene expression control. Detailed characterizations of BTG2 show that it enhances deadenylation of all transcripts tested. Our results demonstrate that Caf1 nuclease activity is required for efficient deadenylation in mammalian cells and that the deadenylase activities of both Caf1 and its Ccr4 partner are required for Btg2-induced poly(A) degradation. General activation of deadenylation may represent a new mode of global regulation of gene expression, which could be important to allow rapid resetting of protein production during development or after specific stresses. This may constitute a common function for BTG/Tob family members."
19580267,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,VE-cadherin is a critical endothelial regulator of TGF-beta signalling.,"VE-cadherin is an endothelial-specific transmembrane protein concentrated at cell-to-cell adherens junctions. Besides promoting cell adhesion and controlling vascular permeability, VE-cadherin transfers intracellular signals that contribute to vascular stabilization. However, the molecular mechanism by which VE-cadherin regulates vascular homoeostasis is still poorly understood. Here, we report that VE-cadherin expression and junctional clustering are required for optimal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signalling in endothelial cells (ECs). TGF-beta antiproliferative and antimigratory responses are increased in the presence of VE-cadherin. ECs lacking VE-cadherin are less responsive to TGF-beta/ALK1- and TGF-beta/ALK5-induced Smad phosphorylation and target gene transcription. VE-cadherin coimmunoprecipitates with all the components of the TGF-beta receptor complex, TbetaRII, ALK1, ALK5 and endoglin. Clustered VE-cadherin recruits TbetaRII and may promote TGF-beta signalling by enhancing TbetaRII/TbetaRI assembly into an active receptor complex. Taken together, our data indicate that VE-cadherin is a positive and EC-specific regulator of TGF-beta signalling. This suggests that reduction or inactivation of VE-cadherin may contribute to progression of diseases where TGF-beta signalling is impaired."
19580272,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,NFAR-1 and -2 modulate translation and are required for efficient host defense.,"We report here that the alternatively spliced nuclear factors associated with double-stranded RNA, NFAR-1 (90 kDa) and -2 (110 kDa), are involved in retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and can regulate the export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the NFAR proteins were found to remain associated with exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Loss of NFAR function, which was embryonic-lethal, caused an increase in protein synthesis rates, an effect augmented by the presence of the mRNA export factors TAP, p15, or Rae1. Significantly, NFAR depletion in normal murine fibroblasts rendered these cells dramatically susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the NFARs exert influence on mRNA trafficking and the modulation of translation rates and may constitute an innate immune translational surveillance mechanism important in host defense countermeasures against virus infection."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Heparan sulfate biosynthesis enzymes EXT1 and EXT2 affect NDST1 expression and heparan sulfate sulfation.,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans influence embryonic development and adult physiology through interactions with protein ligands. The interactions depend on HS structure, which is determined largely during biosynthesis by Golgi enzymes. How biosynthesis is regulated is more or less unknown. During polymerization of the HS chain, carried out by a complex of the exostosin proteins EXT1 and EXT2, the first modification enzyme, glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), introduces N-sulfate groups into the growing polymer. Unexpectedly, we found that the level of expression of EXT1 and EXT2 affected the amount of NDST1 present in the cell, which, in turn, greatly influenced HS structure. Whereas overexpression of EXT2 in HEK 293 cells enhanced NDST1 expression, increased NDST1 N-glycosylation, and resulted in elevated HS sulfation, overexpression of EXT1 had opposite effects. Accordingly, heart tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing EXT2 showed increased NDST activity. Immunoprecipitaion experiments suggested an interaction between EXT2 and NDST1. We speculate that NDST1 competes with EXT1 for binding to EXT2. Increased NDST activity in fibroblasts with a gene trap mutation in EXT1 supports this notion. These results support a model in which the enzymes of HS biosynthesis form a complex, or a GAGosome."

However, its antiatherogenic role remains controversial. Here we report atheroprotective effects of PPARdelta activation in a model of angiotensin II (AngII)-accelerated atherosclerosis, characterized by increased vascular inflammation related to repression of an antiinflammatory corepressor, B cell lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6), and the regulators of G protein-coupled signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4 and RGS5. In this model, administration of the PPARdelta agonist GW0742 (1 or 10 mg/kg) substantially attenuated AngII-accelerated atherosclerosis without altering blood pressure and increased vascular expression of Bcl-6, RGS4, and RGS5, which was associated with suppression of inflammatory and atherogenic gene expression in the artery. In vitro studies demonstrated similar changes in AngII-treated macrophages: PPARdelta activation increased both total and free Bcl-6 levels and inhibited AngII activation of MAP kinases, p38, and ERK1/2. These studies uncover crucial proinflammatory mechanisms of AngII and highlight actions of PPARdelta activation to inhibit AngII signaling, which is atheroprotective."

However, other members of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family have been reported to be endocytosis-impaired. Here we demonstrate that endocytosis of ErbB4 is regulated in an isoform-specific manner: CYT-1 isoforms were efficiently endocytosed whereas CYT-2 isoforms were endocytosis-impaired. CYT-1 isoforms in endocytic vesicles colocalized with Rab5 and Rab7 indicating trafficking via early endosomes to late endosomal/lysosomal structures. A PPXY motif within the CYT-1-specific sequence that lacks from CYT-2 was necessary both for ubiquitination and endocytosis of CYT-1 isoforms and provided a binding site for a WW domain-containing ubiquitin ligase Itch. Itch catalyzed ubiquitination of ErbB4 CYT-1, promoted its localization into intracellular vesicles, and stimulated degradation of ErbB4 CYT-1. Dominant negative Itch suppressed ErbB4 CYT-1 endocytosis and degradation. These data indicate that ErbB4 isoforms differ in endocytosis and degradation by a mechanism mediated by CYT-1-specific PPXY motif interacting with a WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase."
19581286,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Crystal structure of the [2Fe-2S] oxidative-stress sensor SoxR bound to DNA.,"The [2Fe-2S] transcription factor SoxR, a member of the MerR family, functions as a bacterial sensor of oxidative stress such as superoxide and nitric oxide. SoxR is activated by reversible one-electron oxidation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and then enhances the production of various antioxidant proteins through the soxRS regulon. In the active state, SoxR and other MerR family proteins activate transcription from unique promoters, which have a long 19- or 20-bp spacer between the -35 and -10 operator elements, by untwisting the promoter DNA. Here, we show the crystal structures of SoxR and its complex with the target promoter in the oxidized (active) state. The structures reveal that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SoxR is completely solvent-exposed and surrounded by an asymmetric environment stabilized by interaction with the other subunit. The asymmetrically charged environment of the [2Fe-2S] cluster probably causes redox-dependent conformational changes of SoxR and the target promoter. Compared with the promoter structures with the 19-bp spacer previously studied, the DNA structure is more sharply bent, by approximately 1 bp, with the two central base pairs holding Watson-Crick base pairs. Comparison of the target promoter sequences of the MerR family indicates that the present DNA structure represents the activated conformation of the target promoter with a 20-bp spacer in the MerR family."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,p72 DEAD box RNA helicase is required for optimal function of the zinc-finger antiviral protein.,"The zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) specifically inhibits the replication of many viruses by preventing the accumulation of viral mRNAs in the cytoplasm. ZAP directly binds to the viral mRNAs and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the target RNA. In the present study, we identified the p72 DEAD box RNA helicase, but not the highly similar RNA helicase p68, as a ZAP-interacting protein. The binding domain of ZAP was mapped to its N-terminal portion, whereas both the N- and C-terminal domains of p72 bound to ZAP. Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of p72 reduced ZAP's activity, whereas overexpression of the full-length p72 enhanced ZAP's activity. The RNA helicase activity was required for p72 to promote ZAP-mediated RNA degradation. Depletion of p72 by RNAi also reduced ZAP's activity but did not affect tristetraprolin-mediated RNA degradation. We conclude that p72 is required for the optimal activity of ZAP, and we propose that p72 helps to restructure the ZAP-bound target mRNA for efficient degradation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Phenylalanine-427 of anthrax protective antigen functions in both pore formation and protein translocation.,"The protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin forms a heptameric pore in endosomal membranes of mammalian cells and translocates the enzymatic moieties of the toxin to the cytosol of these cells. Phenylalanine-427 (F427), a solvent-exposed residue in the lumen of the pore, was identified earlier as being crucial for the transport function of PA. The seven F427 residues were shown in electrophysiological studies to form a clamp that catalyzes protein translocation through the pore. Here, we demonstrate by a variety of tests that certain F427 mutations also profoundly inhibit the conformational transition of the heptameric PA prepore to the pore and thereby block pore formation in membranes. Lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, or glycine at position 427 strongly inhibited this acidic pH-induced conformational transition, whereas histidine, serine, and threonine had virtually no effect on this step, but inhibited translocation instead. Thus, it is possible to inhibit pore formation or translocation selectively, depending on the choice of the side chain at position 427; and the net inhibition of the PA transport function by any given F427 mutation is the product of its effects on both steps. Mutations inhibiting either or both steps elicited a strong dominant-negative phenotype. These findings demonstrate the dual functions of F427 and underline its central role in transporting the enzymatic moieties of anthrax toxin across membranes."
19581452,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Mechanism of activation and inhibition of the HER4/ErbB4 kinase.,"HER4/ErbB4 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the EGF/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that is essential for normal development of the heart, nervous system, and mammary gland. We report here crystal structures of the ErbB4 kinase domain in active and lapatinib-inhibited forms. Active ErbB4 kinase adopts an asymmetric dimer conformation essentially identical to that observed to be important for activation of the EGF receptor/ErbB1 kinase. Mutagenesis studies of intact ErbB4 in Ba/F3 cells confirm the importance of this asymmetric dimer for activation of intact ErbB4. Lapatinib binds to an inactive form of the ErbB4 kinase in a mode equivalent to its interaction with the EGF receptor. All ErbB4 residues contacted by lapatinib are conserved in the EGF receptor and HER2/ErbB2, which lapatinib also targets. These results demonstrate that key elements of kinase activation and inhibition are conserved among ErbB family members."
19581487,0,Structure,101087697,2008,Structural dynamics of an isolated voltage-sensor domain in a lipid bilayer.,"A strong interplay between the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) and the pore domain (PD) underlies voltage-gated channel functions. In a few voltage-sensitive proteins, the VSD has been shown to function without a canonical PD, although its structure and oligomeric state remain unknown. Here, using EPR spectroscopy, we show that the isolated VSD of KvAP can remain monomeric in a reconstituted bilayer and retain a transmembrane conformation. We find that water-filled crevices extending deep into the membrane around S3, a scaffold conducive to transport of protons/cations, are intrinsic to the VSD. Differences in solvent accessibility in comparison to the full-length KvAP allowed us to define an interacting footprint of the PD on the VSD. This interaction is centered around S1 and S2 and suggests a rotation of 70 degrees -100 degrees relative to Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera. Sequence-conservation patterns in Kv channels, Hv channels, and voltage-sensitive phosphatases reveal several near-universal features suggesting a common molecular architecture for all VSDs."
19581584,0,Structure,101087697,2008,"Colicin N binds to the periphery of its receptor and translocator, outer membrane protein F.","Colicins kill Escherichia coli after translocation across the outer membrane. Colicin N displays an unusually simple translocation pathway, using the outer membrane protein F (OmpF) as both receptor and translocator. Studies of this binary complex may therefore reveal a significant component of the translocation pathway. Here we show that, in 2D crystals, colicin is found outside the porin trimer, suggesting that translocation may occur at the protein-lipid interface. The major lipid of the outer leaflet interface is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is further shown that colicin N binding displaces OmpF-bound LPS. The N-terminal helix of the pore-forming domain, which is not required for pore formation, rearranges and binds to OmpF. Colicin N also binds artificial OmpF dimers, indicating that trimeric symmetry plays no part in the interaction. The data indicate that colicin is closely associated with the OmpF-lipid interface, providing evidence that this peripheral pathway may play a role in colicin transmembrane transport."

This molecular role for caspase-12 appears to be akin to the role of cFLIP in regulating caspase-8 in the extrinsic cell death pathway; however, unlike cFLIP/Usurpin, we demonstrate here that caspase-12 is catalytically competent. To examine these catalytic properties, rat caspase-12 was cloned, and the recombinant enzyme was used to examine the cleavage of macromolecular and synthetic fluorogenic substrates. Although caspase-12 could mediate autoproteolytic maturation of its own proenzyme, in both cis and trans, it was not able to cleave any other polypeptide substrate, including other caspase proenzymes, apoptotic substrates, cytokine precursors, or proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that normally undergo caspase-mediated proteolysis. The dearth of potential substrates for caspase-12 also was confirmed by whole-cell diagonal-gel analysis. Autolytic cleavage within the caspase-12 proenzyme was mapped to a single site at the large-small subunit junction, ATAD(319), and this motif was recognized by caspase-12 when incorporated into synthetic fluorogenic substrates. The specific activity of caspase-12 with these substates was several orders of magnitude lower than caspases-1 and -3, highlighting its relative catalytic paucity. In intact cells, caspase-12 autoproteolysis occurred in the inhibitory complex containing caspase-1. We propose that the proteolytic activity of caspase-12 is confined to its own proenzyme and that autocleavage within the caspase-1 complex may be a means for temporal limitation of the inhibitory effects of caspase-12 on proinflammatory cytokine maturation."

Although asexual forms are directly responsible for disease and death, sexual stages account for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites from human to the mosquito vector and therefore the spread of the parasite in the population. Development of a malaria vaccine is urgently needed to reduce morbidity and mortality. Vaccines against sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum are meant to decrease the force of transmission and consequently reduce malaria burden. Pfs48/45 is specifically expressed in sexual stages and is a well established transmission-blocking (TB) vaccine candidate. However, production of correctly folded recombinant Pfs48/45 protein with display of its TB epitopes has been a major challenge. Here, we show the production of a properly folded Pfs48/45 C-terminal fragment by simultaneous coexpression with four periplasmic folding catalysts in Escherichia coli. This C-terminal fragment fused to maltose binding protein was produced at medium scale with &gt;90% purity and a stability over at least a 9-month period. It induces uniform and high antibody titers in mice and elicits functional TB antibodies in standard membrane feeding assays in 90% of the immunized mice. Our data provide a clear perspective on the clinical development of a Pfs48/45-based TB malaria vaccine."

We previously demonstrated that Rab13 and a junctional Rab13-binding protein (JRAB)/molecule interacting with CasL-like 2 (MICAL-L2) localized at TJs and mediated the endocytic recycling of the integral TJ protein occludin and the formation of functional TJs. Here, we investigated how JRAB/MICAL-L2 was targeted to TJs. Using a series of deletion mutants, we found the plasma membrane (PM)-targeting domain within JRAB/MICAL-L2. We then identified actinin-4, which was originally isolated as an actin-binding protein associated with cell motility and cancer invasion/metastasis, as a binding protein for the PM-targeting domain of JRAB/MICAL-L2, using a yeast two-hybrid system. Actinin-4 was colocalized with JRAB/MICAL-L2 at cell-cell junctions and linked JRAB/MICAL-L2 to F-actin. Although actinin-4 bound to JRAB/MICAL-L2 without Rab13, the actinin-4-JRAB/MICAL-L2 interaction was enhanced by Rab13 activation. Depletion of actinin-4 by using small interfering RNA inhibited the recruitment of occludin to TJs during the Ca(2+) switch. During the epithelial polarization after replating, JRAB/MICAL-L2 was recruited from the cytosol to cell-cell junctions. This JRAB/MICAL-L2 recruitment as well as the formation of functional TJs was delayed in actinin-4-depleted cells. These results indicate that actinin-4 is involved in recruiting JRAB/MICAL-L2 to cell-cell junctions and forming functional TJs."
19583257,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,TTLL10 is a protein polyglycylase that can modify nucleosome assembly protein 1.,"Certain proteins can undergo polyglycylation and polyglutamylation. Polyglutamylases (glutamate ligases) have recently been identified in a family of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) proteins. However, no polyglycylase (glycine ligase) has yet been reported. Here we identify a polyglycylase in the TTLL proteins by using an anti-poly-glycine antibody. The antibody reacted with a cytoplasmic 60-kDa protein that accumulated in elongating spermatids. Using tandem mass spectrometry of trypsinized samples, immunoprecipitated by the antibody from the TTLL10-expressing cells, we identified the 60-kDa protein as nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1). Recombinant TTLL10 incorporated glycine into recombinant NAP1 in vitro. Mutational analyses indicated that Glu residues at 359 and 360 in the C-terminal part of NAP1 are putative sites for the modification. Thus, TTLL10 is a polyglycylase for NAP1."

Chem.,2985121R,2008,Characterization of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein.,"We have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation to analyze the interactions among the alpha, beta, and gamma1 subunits of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein. Using cyan and yellow fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we show that overexpressed Ggamma1 localizes to protoplast membranes, but Gbeta exhibits membrane localization only when the Ggamma1 protein is co-overexpressed. Overexpressed Galpha shows membrane localization unaccompanied by overexpression of either Gbeta or Ggamma1. We detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Gbeta and Ggamma1 in the absence of Galpha overexpression and between Galpha and Ggamma1 but only when all three subunits are co-overexpressed. Both Galpha and Gbeta are associated with large macromolecular complexes of approximately 700 kDa in the plasma membrane. Galpha is present in both large complexes and as free Galpha in plasma membranes from wild type plants. In plants homozygous for a null allele of the Gbeta gene, Galpha is associated with smaller complexes in the 200-400-kDa range, indicating that its presence in the large complex depends on association with Gbetagamma. Activation of the Galpha subunit with guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) results in partial dissociation of Galpha from the complex. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promotes extensive dissociation of the Galpha complex but does not interfere with binding of GTPgammaS to purified recombinant Galpha, suggesting that reactive oxygen species affect the stability of the large complex but not the activity of Galpha itself."
19583833,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,NEDD8 acts as a 'molecular switch' defining the functional selectivity of VHL.,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein is important in the E3 ubiquitin ligase ECV (Elongin B/C-CUL2-VHL)-mediated destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor and the promotion of fibronectin (FN) extracellular matrix assembly. Although the precise molecular mechanism controlling the selectivity of VHL function remains unknown, a failure in either process is associated with oncogenic progression. Here, we show that VHL performs its FN-associated function independently of the ECV complex, highlighting the autonomy of these pathways. Furthermore, we show that NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like molecule, acts as a 'molecular switch' in which its covalent conjugation to VHL prohibits the engagement of the scaffold component CUL2 and, concomitantly, activates the association with FN. These findings provide the first mechanistic step in defining the functional selectivity of VHL and explain a previously unrecognized function of NEDD8."
19584095,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Proteolysis of AKAP121 regulates mitochondrial activity during cellular hypoxia and brain ischaemia.,"A-kinase anchor protein 121 (AKAP121) assembles a multivalent signalling complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane that controls persistence and amplitude of cAMP and src signalling to mitochondria, and plays an essential role in oxidative metabolism and cell survival. Here, we show that AKAP121 levels are regulated post-translationally by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Seven In-Absentia Homolog 2 (Siah2), an E3-ubiquitin ligase whose expression is induced in hypoxic conditions, formed a complex and degraded AKAP121. In addition, we show that overexpression of Siah2 or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes Siah2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis of AKAP121. Upregulation of Siah2, by modulation of the cellular levels of AKAP121, significantly affects mitochondrial activity assessed as mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative capacity. Also during cerebral ischaemia, AKAP121 is degraded in a Siah2-dependent manner. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of attenuation of cAMP/PKA signaling, which occurs at the distal sites of signal generation mediated by proteolysis of an AKAP scaffold protein. By regulating the stability of AKAP121-signalling complex at mitochondria, cells efficiently and rapidly adapt oxidative metabolism to fluctuations in oxygen availability."
19584254,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Spatial separation of Golgi and ER during mitosis protects SREBP from unregulated activation.,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound transcription factors that reside as inactive precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. After sterol depletion, the proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P). Cleavage releases the active transcription factors, which then enter the nucleus to induce genes that regulate cellular levels of cholesterol and phospholipids. This regulation depends on the spatial separation of the Golgi and the ER, as mixing of the compartments induces unregulated activation of SREBPs. Here, we show that S1P is localized to the Golgi, but cycles continuously through the ER and becomes trapped when ER exit is inhibited. During mitosis, S1P is associated with mitotic Golgi clusters, which remain distinct from the ER. In mitotic cells, S1P is active, but SREBP is not cleaved as S1P and SREBP reside in different compartments. Together, these results indicate that the spatial separation of the Golgi and the ER is maintained during mitosis, which is essential to protect the S1P substrate SREBP from unregulated activation during mitosis."

We report here the identification of zinc finger protein-like 1 (ZFPL1) as a novel structural component of the Golgi apparatus. ZFPL1 is a conserved and widely expressed integral membrane protein with two predicted zinc fingers at the N-terminus, the second of which is a likely ring domain. ZFPL1 directly interacts with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130. Depletion of ZFPL1 results in the accumulation of cis-Golgi matrix proteins in the intermediate compartment (IC) and the tubulation of cis-Golgi and IC membranes. Loss of ZFPL1 function also impairs cis-Golgi assembly following brefeldin A washout and slows the rate of cargo trafficking into the Golgi apparatus. Effects upon Golgi matrix protein localization and cis-Golgi structure can be rescued by wild-type ZFPL1 but not mutants defective in GM130 binding. Together, these data suggest that ZFPL1 has an important function in maintaining the integrity of the cis-Golgi and that it does so through interactions with GM130."

In this article, we have studied this complex in leaves and have shown that dissociation and reassociation of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex occurs in a time frame of minutes, allowing for rapid regulation of enzyme activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the extent of formation and dissociation of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex correlates with the quantity of light. These data provide evidence linking the status of this complex with the rapid and subtle regulation of GAPDH and PRK activities in response to fluctuations in light availability. We have also demonstrated that dissociation of this complex depends on electron transport chain activity and that the major factor involved in the dissociation of the pea complex was thioredoxin f. We show here that both PRK and GAPDH are present in the reduced form in leaves in the dark, but are inactive, demonstrating the role of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex in deactivating these enzymes in response to reductions in light intensity. Based on our data, we propose a model for thioredoxin f-mediated activation of PRK and GAPDH by two mechanisms: directly through reduction of disulfide bonds within these enzymes and indirectly by mediating the breakdown of the complex in response to changes in light intensity."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Analyses of Mlc-IIBGlc interaction and a plausible molecular mechanism of Mlc inactivation by membrane sequestration.,"In Escherichia coli, glucose-dependent transcriptional induction of genes encoding a variety of sugar-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems is mediated by the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction of membrane-bound enzyme IICB(Glc) (EIICB(Glc)) with the global repressor Mlc. Here we report the crystal structure of a tetrameric Mlc in a complex with four molecules of enzyme IIB(Glc) (EIIB), the cytoplasmic domain of EIICB(Glc). Each monomer of Mlc has one bound EIIB molecule, indicating the 1:1 stoichiometry. The detailed view of the interface, along with the high-resolution structure of EIIB containing a sulfate ion at the phosphorylation site, suggests that the phosphorylation-induced steric hindrance and disturbance of polar intermolecular interactions impede complex formation. Furthermore, we reveal that Mlc possesses a built-in flexibility for the structural adaptation to its target DNA and that interaction of Mlc with EIIB fused only to dimeric proteins resulted in the loss of its DNA binding ability, suggesting that flexibility of the Mlc structure is indispensable for its DNA binding."

Chem.,2985121R,2008,Fhit interaction with ferredoxin reductase triggers generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis of cancer cells.,"Fhit protein is lost in most cancers, its restoration suppresses tumorigenicity, and virus-mediated FHIT gene therapy induces apoptosis and suppresses tumors in preclinical models. We have used protein cross-linking and proteomics methods to characterize a Fhit protein complex involved in triggering Fhit-mediated apoptosis. The complex includes Hsp60 and Hsp10 that mediate Fhit stability and may affect import into mitochondria, where it interacts with ferredoxin reductase, responsible for transferring electrons from NADPH to cytochrome P450 via ferredoxin. Viral-mediated Fhit restoration increases production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, followed by increased apoptosis of lung cancer cells under oxidative stress conditions; conversely, Fhit-negative cells escape apoptosis, carrying serious oxidative DNA damage that may contribute to an increased mutation rate. Characterization of Fhit interacting proteins has identified direct effectors of the Fhit-mediated apoptotic pathway that is lost in most cancers through loss of Fhit."
19584530,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Insights into mad2 regulation in the spindle checkpoint revealed by the crystal structure of the symmetric mad2 dimer.,"In response to misaligned sister chromatids during mitosis, the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2 inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) through binding to its mitotic activator Cdc20, thus delaying anaphase onset. Mad1, an upstream regulator of Mad2, forms a tight core complex with Mad2 and facilitates Mad2 binding to Cdc20. In the absence of its binding proteins, free Mad2 has two natively folded conformers, termed N1-Mad2/open-Mad2 (O-Mad2) and N2-Mad2/closed Mad2 (C-Mad2), with C-Mad2 being more active in APC/C(Cdc20) inhibition. Here, we show that whereas O-Mad2 is monomeric, C-Mad2 forms either symmetric C-Mad2-C-Mad2 (C-C) or asymmetric O-Mad2-C-Mad2 (O-C) dimers. We also report the crystal structure of the symmetric C-C Mad2 dimer, revealing the basis for the ability of unliganded C-Mad2, but not O-Mad2 or liganded C-Mad2, to form symmetric dimers. A Mad2 mutant that predominantly forms the C-C dimer is functional in vitro and in living cells. Finally, the Mad1-Mad2 core complex facilitates the conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 in vitro. Collectively, our results establish the existence of a symmetric Mad2 dimer and provide insights into Mad1-assisted conformational activation of Mad2 in the spindle checkpoint."

MI-219 binds to human MDM2 with a K(i) value of 5 nM and is 10,000-fold selective for MDM2 over MDMX. It disrupts the MDM2-p53 interaction and activates the p53 pathway in cells with wild-type p53, which leads to induction of cell cycle arrest in all cells and selective apoptosis in tumor cells. MI-219 stimulates rapid but transient p53 activation in established tumor xenograft tissues, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and complete tumor growth inhibition. MI-219 activates p53 in normal tissues with minimal p53 accumulation and is not toxic to animals. MI-219 warrants clinical investigation as a new agent for cancer treatment."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Human HLTF functions as a ubiquitin ligase for proliferating cell nuclear antigen polyubiquitination.,"Human helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) is frequently inactivated in colorectal and gastric cancers. Here, we show that HLTF is a functional homologue of yeast Rad5 that promotes error-free replication through DNA lesions. HLTF and Rad5 share the same unique structural features, including a RING domain embedded within a SWI/SNF helicase domain and an HIRAN domain. We find that inactivation of HLTF renders human cells sensitive to UV and other DNA-damaging agents and that HLTF complements the UV sensitivity of a rad5Delta yeast strain. Also, similar to Rad5, HLTF physically interacts with the Rad6-Rad18 and Mms2-Ubc13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complexes and promotes the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen at its Lys-164 residue. A requirement of HLTF for error-free postreplication repair of damaged DNA is in keeping with its cancer-suppression role."
19584559,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2008,Molecular basis of nuclear factor-kappaB activation by astrocyte elevated gene-1.,"Malignant glioma is a consistently fatal brain cancer. The tumor invades the surrounding tissue, limiting complete surgical removal and thereby initiating recurrence. Identifying molecules critical for glioma invasion is essential to develop targeted, effective therapies. The expression of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) increases in malignant glioma and AEG-1 regulates in vitro invasion and migration of malignant glioma cells by activating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. The present studies elucidate the domains of AEG-1 important for mediating its function. Serial NH(2)-terminal and COOH-terminal deletion mutants were constructed and functional analysis revealed that the NH(2)-terminal 71 amino acids were essential for invasion, migration, and NF-kappaB-activating properties of AEG-1. The p65-interaction domain was identified between amino acids 101 to 205, indicating that p65 interaction alone is not sufficient to mediate AEG-1 function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that AEG-1 interacts with cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP), indicating that it might act as a bridging factor between NF-kappaB, CBP, and the basal transcription machinery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that AEG-1 is associated with the NF-kappaB binding element in the interleukin-8 promoter. Thus, AEG-1 might function as a coactivator for NF-kappaB, consequently augmenting expression of genes necessary for invasion of glioma cells. In these contexts, AEG-1 represents a viable potential target for the therapy of malignant glioma."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Gating-associated conformational changes in the mechanosensitive channel MscL.,"Bacterial cells avoid lysis in response to hypoosmotic shock through the opening of the mechanosensitive channel MscL. Upon channel opening, MscL is thought to expand in the plane of the membrane and form a large pore with an estimated diameter of 3-4 nm. Here, we set out to analyze the closed and open structure of cell-free MscL. To this end, we characterized the function and structure of wild-type MscL and a mutant form of the protein (G22N MscL) that spontaneously adopts an open substate. Patch-clamp analysis of MscL that had been reconstituted into liposomes revealed that wild-type MscL was activated only by mechanical stimuli, whereas G22N MscL displayed spontaneous opening to the open substate. In accord with these results, Ca(2+) influx into G22N MscL-containing liposomes occurred in the absence of mechanical stimulation. The electrophoretic migration of chemically cross-linked G22N MscL was slower than that of cross-linked wild-type MscL, suggesting that G22N MscL is in an expanded form. Finally, electron microscopy using low-angle rotary shadowing revealed the presence of a pore at the center of G22N MscL. No pore could be detected in wild-type MscL. However, wild-type MscL possessed a protrusion at one end, which was absent in G22N MscL. The deletion of carboxyl-terminal 27 residues resulted in the loss of protrusion and proper multimerization. The structures of wild-type and G22N MscL reveal that the opening of MscL is accompanied by the dissociation of a carboxyl-terminal protrusion and pore formation."

Our design exploited the observation that the crystal lattice of Hcp1 contains rings stacked in a repeating head-to-tail pattern. High-resolution detail of the ring-ring interface allowed the selection of sites for specific cysteine mutations capable of engaging in disulfide bond formation across rings, thereby generating stable Hcp1 nanotubes. Protein nanotubes containing up to 25 subunits ( approximately 100 nm in length) were self-assembled under simple conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the tube ends and interior can be independently and specifically functionalized to generate nanocapsules."

The MDM2-p53 interaction is well characterized, but the mechanisms that regulate the interaction are not well understood. Here, we show that PA28gamma, a proteasome activator that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression through unknown mechanisms, exerts an effect as a cofactor in the MDM2-p53 interaction. The polymer form of PA28gamma interacts with both MDM2 and p53 proteins and facilitates their physical interaction. This promotes ubiquitination- and MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53, limiting its accumulation and resulting in inhibited apoptosis after DNA damage. Elimination of endogenous PA28gamma in human cancer cells abrogates MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, increases the activity of p53, and enhances apoptosis. These findings reveal the mechanism by which PA28gamma affects apoptosis and proliferation. Manipulation of the level of PA28gamma, an approach that would regulate the cellular content of p53, may improve the efficacy of current cancer therapies."
19586911,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Drosophila Ebi mediates Snail-dependent transcriptional repression through HDAC3-induced histone deacetylation.,"The Drosophila Snail protein is a transcriptional repressor that is necessary for mesoderm formation. Here, we identify the Ebi protein as an essential Snail co-repressor. In ebi mutant embryos, Snail target genes are derepressed in the presumptive mesoderm. Ebi and Snail interact both genetically and physically. We identify a Snail domain that is sufficient for Ebi binding, and which functions independently of another Snail co-repressor, Drosophila CtBP. This Ebi interaction domain is conserved among all insect Snail-related proteins, is a potent repression domain and is required for Snail function in transgenic embryos. In mammalian cells, the Ebi homologue TBL1 is part of the NCoR/SMRT-HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3) co-repressor complex. We found that Ebi interacts with Drosophila HDAC3, and that HDAC3 knockdown or addition of a HDAC inhibitor impairs Snail-mediated repression in cells. In the early embryo, Ebi is recruited to a Snail target gene in a Snail-dependent manner, which coincides with histone hypoacetylation. Our results demonstrate that Snail requires the combined activities of Ebi and CtBP, and indicate that histone deacetylation is a repression mechanism in early Drosophila development."
19586921,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,S-glutathionylation of IRF3 regulates IRF3-CBP interaction and activation of the IFN beta pathway.,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes. IRF3 is constitutively present in a latent conformation in the cell cytoplasm. In cells infected by Sendai virus, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated, homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, binds to target genes and activates transcription by interacting with CBP/p300 co-activators. In this study, we report that in non-infected cells IRF3 is post-translationally modified by S-glutathionylation. Upon viral-infection, it undergoes a deglutathionylation step that is controlled by the cytoplasmic enzyme glutaredoxin-1 (GRX-1). In virus-infected GRX-1 knockdown cells, phosphorylation, homodimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were not affected, but the transcriptional activity of IRF3 and the expression of interferon-beta (IFNbeta), were severely reduced. We show that deglutathionylation of IRF3 is necessary for efficient interaction of IRF3 with CBP, an event essential for transcriptional activation of the interferon genes. Taken together, these findings reveal a crucial role for S-glutathionylation and GRX-1 in controlling the activation of IRF3 and IFNbeta gene expression."
19587005,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Plx1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication under stressful conditions.,"Polo-like kinase (Plk)1 is required for mitosis progression. However, although Plk1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle, its function during S-phase is unknown. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we demonstrate that Plx1, the Xenopus orthologue of Plk1, is required for DNA replication in the presence of stalled replication forks induced by aphidicolin, etoposide or reduced levels of DNA-bound Mcm complexes. Plx1 binds to chromatin and suppresses the ATM/ATR-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint that inhibits origin firing. This allows Cdc45 loading and derepression of DNA replication initiation. Checkpoint activation increases Plx1 binding to the Mcm complex through its Polo box domain. Plx1 recruitment to chromatin is independent of checkpoint mediators Tipin and Claspin. Instead, ATR-dependent phosphorylation of serine 92 of Mcm2 is required for the recruitment of Plx1 to chromatin and for the recovery of DNA replication under stress. Depletion of Plx1 leads to accumulation of chromosomal breakage that is prevented by the addition of recombinant Plx1. These data suggest that Plx1 promotes genome stability by regulating DNA replication under stressful conditions."
19587096,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,The Rap-RapGAP complex: GTP hydrolysis without catalytic glutamine and arginine residues.,"The GTP-binding protein Rap1 regulates integrin-mediated and other cell adhesion processes. Unlike most other Ras-related proteins, it contains a threonine in switch II instead of a glutamine (Gln61 in Ras), a residue crucial for the GTPase reaction of most G proteins. Furthermore, unlike most other GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for small G proteins, which supply a catalytically important Arg-finger, no arginine residue of RapGAP makes a significant contribution to the GTPase reaction of Rap1. For a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism, we have solved the structure of Rap1 in complex with Rap1GAP. It shows that the Thr61 of Rap is away from the active site and that an invariant asparagine of RapGAPs, the Asn-thumb, takes over the role of the cis-glutamine of Ras, Rho or Ran. The structure and biochemical data allow to further explain the mechanism and to define the important role of a conserved tyrosine. The structure and biochemical data furthermore show that the RapGAP homologous region of the tumour suppressor Tuberin is sufficient for catalysis on Rheb."
19587097,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Spindle assembly checkpoint gene mdf-1 regulates germ cell proliferation in response to nutrition signals in C. elegans.,"When newly hatched Caenorhabditis elegans larvae are starved, their primordial germ cells (PGCs) arrest in the post-S phase. This starvation-induced PGC arrest is mediated by the DAF-18/PTEN-AKT-1/PKB nutrient-sensing pathway. Here, we report that the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) component MDF-1/MAD1 is required for the PGC arrest. We identified 2 Akt kinase phosphorylation sites on MDF-1. Expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant MDF-1 partially suppressed the defect in the starvation-induced PGC arrest in L1 larvae lacking DAF-18, suggesting that MDF-1 regulates germ cell proliferation as a downstream target of AKT-1, thereby demonstrating a functional link between cell-cycle regulation by the SAC components and nutrient sensing by DAF-18-AKT-1 during post-embryonic development. The phosphorylation status of MDF-1 affects its binding to another SAC component, MDF-2/MAD2. The loss of MDF-2 or another SAC component also caused inappropriate germ cell proliferation, but the defect was less severe than that caused by mdf-1 hemizygosity, suggesting that MDF-1 causes the PGC arrest by two mechanisms, one involving MDF-2 and another that is independent of other SAC components."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,A SPIKE1 signaling complex controls actin-dependent cell morphogenesis through the heteromeric WAVE and ARP2/3 complexes.,"During morphogenesis, the actin cytoskeleton mediates cell-shape change in response to growth signals. In plants, actin filaments organize the cytoplasm in regions of polarized growth, and the filamentous arrays can be highly dynamic. Small GTPase signaling proteins termed Rho of plants (ROP)/RAC control actin polymerization. ROPs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms, and it is the active form that interacts with effector proteins to mediate cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell-shape change. A class of proteins termed guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) generate GTP-ROP and positively regulate ROP signaling. However, in almost all experimental systems, it has proven difficult to unravel the complex signaling pathways from GEFs to the proteins that nucleate actin filaments. In this article, we show that the DOCK family protein SPIKE1 (SPK1) is a GEF, and that one function of SPK1 is to control actin polymerization via two heteromeric complexes termed WAVE and actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3. The genetic pathway was constructed by using a combination of highly informative spk1 alleles and detailed analyses of spk1, wave, and arp2/3 single and double mutants. Remarkably, we find that in addition to providing GEF activity, SPK1 associates with WAVE complex proteins and may spatially organize signaling. Our results describe a unique regulatory scheme for ARP2/3 regulation in cells, one that can be tested for widespread use in other multicellular organisms."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Regulation of synaptic inhibition by phospho-dependent binding of the AP2 complex to a YECL motif in the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit.,"The regulation of the number of gamma2-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) present at synapses is critical for correct synaptic inhibition and animal behavior. This regulation occurs, in part, by the controlled removal of receptors from the membrane in clathrin-coated vesicles, but it remains unclear how clathrin recruitment to surface gamma2-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs is regulated. Here, we identify a gamma2-subunit-specific Yxxvarphi-type-binding motif for the clathrin adaptor protein, AP2, which is located within a site for gamma2-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Blocking GABA(A)R-AP2 interactions via this motif increases synaptic responses within minutes. Crystallographic and biochemical studies reveal that phosphorylation of the Yxxvarphi motif inhibits AP2 binding, leading to increased surface receptor number. In addition, the crystal structure provides an explanation for the high affinity of this motif for AP2 and suggests that gamma2-subunit-containing heteromeric GABA(A)Rs may be internalized as dimers or multimers. These data define a mechanism for tyrosine kinase regulation of GABA(A)R surface levels and synaptic inhibition."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,ISG15 inhibits Ebola VP40 VLP budding in an L-domain-dependent manner by blocking Nedd4 ligase activity.,"Ebola virus budding is mediated by the VP40 matrix protein. VP40 can bud from mammalian cells independent of other viral proteins, and efficient release of VP40 virus-like particles (VLPs) requires interactions with host proteins such as tsg101 and Nedd4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitin itself is thought to be exploited by Ebola virus to facilitate efficient virus egress. Disruption of VP40 function and thus virus budding remains an attractive target for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Here, we investigate the effect of ISG15 protein on the release of Ebola VP40 VLPs. ISG15 is an IFN-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein expressed after bacterial or viral infection. Our results show that expression of free ISG15, or the ISGylation system (UbE1L and UbcH8), inhibits budding of Ebola virus VP40 VLPs. Addressing the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we show that ISG15 interacts with Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase and inhibits ubiquitination of VP40. Furthermore, the L-domain deletion mutant of VP40 (DeltaPT/PY), which does not interact with Nedd4, was insensitive to ISG15-mediated inhibition of VLP release. These data provide evidence of antiviral activity of ISG15 against Ebola virus and suggest a mechanism of action involving disruption of Nedd4 function and subsequent ubiquitination of VP40."
19587447,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Caldendrin-Jacob: a protein liaison that couples NMDA receptor signalling to the nucleus.,"NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and calcium can exert multiple and very divergent effects within neuronal cells, thereby impacting opposing occurrences such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal degeneration. The neuronal Ca2+ sensor Caldendrin is a postsynaptic density component with high similarity to calmodulin. Jacob, a recently identified Caldendrin binding partner, is a novel protein abundantly expressed in limbic brain and cerebral cortex. Strictly depending upon activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, Jacob is recruited to neuronal nuclei, resulting in a rapid stripping of synaptic contacts and in a drastically altered morphology of the dendritic tree. Jacob's nuclear trafficking from distal dendrites crucially requires the classical Importin pathway. Caldendrin binds to Jacob's nuclear localization signal in a Ca2+-dependent manner, thereby controlling Jacob's extranuclear localization by competing with the binding of Importin-alpha to Jacob's nuclear localization signal. This competition requires sustained synapto-dendritic Ca2+ levels, which presumably cannot be achieved by activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, but are confined to Ca2+ microdomains such as postsynaptic spines. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, as opposed to their synaptic counterparts, trigger the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) shut-off pathway, and cell death. We found that nuclear knockdown of Jacob prevents CREB shut-off after extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, whereas its nuclear overexpression induces CREB shut-off without NMDA receptor stimulation. Importantly, nuclear knockdown of Jacob attenuates NMDA-induced loss of synaptic contacts, and neuronal degeneration. This defines a novel mechanism of synapse-to-nucleus communication via a synaptic Ca2+-sensor protein, which links the activity of NMDA receptors to nuclear signalling events involved in modelling synapto-dendritic input and NMDA receptor-induced cellular degeneration."
19588926,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,BAF60a interacts with p53 to recruit the SWI/SNF complex.,"To understand the tumor-suppressing mechanism of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, we investigated its molecular relationship with p53. Using the pREP4-luc episomal reporter, we first demonstrated that p53 utilizes the chromatin remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complex to initiate transcription from the chromatin-structured promoter. Among the components of the SWI/SNF complex, we identified BAF60a as a mediator of the interaction with p53 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. p53 directly interacted only with BAF60a, but not with other components of the SWI/SNF complex, such as BRG1, SRG3, SNF5, or BAF57. We found out that multiple residues at the amino acid 108-150 region of BAF60a were involved in the interaction with the tetramerization domain of p53. The N-terminal fragment of BAF60a containing the p53-interacting region as well as small interfering RNA for baf60a inhibited the SWI/SNF complex-mediated transcriptional activity of p53. The uncoupling of p53 with the SWI/SNF complex resulted in the repression of both p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by the regulation of target genes. These results suggest that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is involved in the suppression of tumors by the interaction with p53."
19588964,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,A role for the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 in the regulation of autophagy.,"We demonstrate a role for the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 in the regulation of autophagy. In particular, transient increased expression of Sirt1 is sufficient to stimulate basal rates of autophagy. In addition, we show that Sirt1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts do not fully activate autophagy under starved conditions. Reconstitution with wild-type but not a deacetylase-inactive mutant of Sirt1 restores autophagy in these cells. We further demonstrate that Sirt1 can form a molecular complex with several essential components of the autophagy machinery, including autophagy genes (Atg)5, Atg7, and Atg8. In vitro, Sirt1 can, in an NAD-dependent fashion, directly deacetylate these components. The absence of Sirt1 leads to markedly elevated acetylation of proteins known to be required for autophagy in both cultured cells and in embryonic and neonatal tissues. Finally, we show that Sirt1(-/-) mice partially resemble Atg5(-/-) mice, including the accumulation of damaged organelles, disruption of energy homeostasis, and early perinatal mortality. Furthermore, the in utero delivery of the metabolic substrate pyruvate extends the survival of Sirt1(-/-) pups. These results suggest that the Sirt1 deacetylase is an important in vivo regulator of autophagy and provide a link between sirtuin function and the overall cellular response to limited nutrients."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by binding to eIF4A using both its MA3 domains.,"Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) is a protein known to bind eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), inhibit translation initiation, and act as a tumor suppressor. PDCD4 contains two C-terminal MA3 domains, which are thought to be responsible for its inhibitory function. Here, we analyze the structures and inhibitory functions of these two PDCD4 MA3 domains by x-ray crystallography, NMR, and surface plasmon resonance. We show that both MA3 domains are structurally and functionally very similar and bind specifically to the eIF4A N-terminal domain (eIF4A-NTD) using similar binding interfaces. We found that the PDCD4 MA3 domains compete with the eIF4G MA3 domain and RNA for eIF4A binding. Our data provide evidence that PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by displacing eIF4G and RNA from eIF4A. The PDCD4 MA3 domains act synergistically to form a tighter and more stable complex with eIF4A, which explains the need for two tandem MA3 domains."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Structure of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an essential monotopic membrane enzyme involved in respiration and metabolism.","Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) is an essential membrane enzyme, functioning at the central junction of respiration, glycolysis, and phospholipid biosynthesis. Its critical role is indicated by the multitiered regulatory mechanisms that stringently controls its expression and function. Once expressed, GlpD activity is regulated through lipid-enzyme interactions in Escherichia coli. Here, we report seven previously undescribed structures of the fully active E. coli GlpD, up to 1.75 A resolution. In addition to elucidating the structure of the native enzyme, we have determined the structures of GlpD complexed with substrate analogues phosphoenolpyruvate, glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and product, dihydroxyacetone phosphate. These structural results reveal conformational states of the enzyme, delineating the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis at the glycerol-3-phosphate site. Two probable mechanisms for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of glycerol-3-phosphate are envisioned, based on the conformational states of the complexes. To further correlate catalytic dehydrogenation to respiration, we have additionally determined the structures of GlpD bound with ubiquinone analogues menadione and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, identifying a hydrophobic plateau that is likely the ubiquinone-binding site. These structures illuminate probable mechanisms of catalysis and suggest how GlpD shuttles electrons into the respiratory pathway. Glycerol metabolism has been implicated in insulin signaling and perturbations in glycerol uptake and catabolism are linked to obesity in humans. Homologs of GlpD are found in practically all organisms, from prokaryotes to humans, with &gt;45% consensus protein sequences, signifying that these structural results on the prokaryotic enzyme may be readily applied to the eukaryotic GlpD enzymes."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Myocardin inhibits cellular proliferation by inhibiting NF-kappaB(p65)-dependent cell cycle progression.,"We previously reported the importance of the serum response factor (SRF) cofactor myocardin in controlling muscle gene expression as well as the fundamental role for the inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB in governing cellular fate. Inactivation of myocardin has been implicated in malignant tumor growth. However, the underlying mechanism of myocardin regulation of cellular growth remains unclear. Here we show that NF-kappaB(p65) represses myocardin activation of cardiac and smooth muscle genes in a CArG-box-dependent manner. Consistent with their functional interaction, p65 directly interacts with myocardin and inhibits the formation of the myocardin/SRF/CArG ternary complex in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, myocardin decreases p65-mediated target gene activation by interfering with p65 DNA binding and abrogates LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression. Importantly, myocardin inhibits cellular proliferation by interfering with NF-kappaB-dependent cell-cycle regulation. Cumulatively, these findings identify a function for myocardin as an SRF-independent transcriptional repressor and cell-cycle regulator and provide a molecular mechanism by which interaction between NF-kappaB and myocardin plays a central role in modulating cellular proliferation and differentiation."
19592063,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,COP1-mediated ubiquitination of CONSTANS is implicated in cryptochrome regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana, the blue light photoreceptor cryptochromes (CRY) act to promote photomorphogenic development and the transition from vegetative to floral development in long days (LDs). We previously proposed that one of the mechanisms by which CRY regulates light responses is via its physical interaction with COP1, a RING motif-containing E3 ligase. Under LDs, the transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is activated by CONSTANS (CO) in leaf, and the FT protein moves to the shoot apex to induce flowering. CO protein is degraded in darkness, whereas it is stabilized by the CRY-mediated signal. However, the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. We show in this report that CO acts genetically downstream of COP1 and CRY to regulate flowering time. In addition, COP1 physically interacts with CO and functions as an E3 ligase, ubiquitinating CO in vitro and reducing CO levels in vivo. These results suggest that COP1 acts as a repressor of flowering by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of CO in darkness and that CRY-mediated signal may negatively regulate COP1, thereby stabilizing CO, activating FT transcription, and inducing flowering."
19592098,0,Genome Res.,9518021,2008,Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions.,"Extracellular protein-protein interactions are essential for both intercellular communication and cohesion within multicellular organisms. Approximately a fifth of human genes encode membrane-tethered or secreted proteins, but they are largely absent from recent large-scale protein interaction datasets, making current interaction networks biased and incomplete. This discrepancy is due to the unsuitability of popular high-throughput methods to detect extracellular interactions because of the biochemical intractability of membrane proteins and their interactions. For example, cell surface proteins contain insoluble hydrophobic transmembrane regions, and their extracellular interactions are often highly transient, having half-lives of less than a second. To detect transient extracellular interactions on a large scale, we developed AVEXIS (avidity-based extracellular interaction screen), a high-throughput assay that overcomes these technical issues and can detect very transient interactions (half-lives &lt;or= 0.1 sec) with a low false-positive rate. We used it to systematically screen for receptor-ligand pairs within the zebrafish immunoglobulin superfamily and identified novel ligands for both well-known and orphan receptors. Genes encoding receptor-ligand pairs were often clustered phylogenetically and expressed in the same or adjacent tissues, immediately implying their involvement in similar biological processes. Using AVEXIS, we have determined the first systematic low-affinity extracellular protein interaction network, supported by independent biological data. This technique will now allow large-scale extracellular protein interaction mapping in a broad range of experimental contexts."

AIRE is expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells, where it promotes the expression of tissue-restricted antigens. By the combined use of biochemical and biophysical methods, we show that AIRE selectively interacts with histone H3 through its first plant homeodomain (PHD) finger (AIRE-PHD1) and preferentially binds to non-methylated H3K4 (H3K4me0). Accordingly, in vivo AIRE binds to and activates promoters containing low levels of H3K4me3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We conclude that AIRE-PHD1 is an important member of a newly identified class of PHD fingers that specifically recognize H3K4me0, thus providing a new link between the status of histone modifications and the regulation of tissue-restricted antigen expression in thymus."
19592425,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Akt and CHIP coregulate tau degradation through coordinated interactions.,"A hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into fibrillar aggregates. Recent studies suggest that they accumulate because cytosolic chaperones fail to clear abnormally phosphorylated tau, preserving a pool of toxic tau intermediates within the neuron. We describe a mechanism for tau clearance involving a major cellular kinase, Akt. During stress, Akt is ubiquitinated and degraded by the tau ubiquitin ligase CHIP, and this largely depends on the Hsp90 complex. Akt also prevents CHIP-induced tau ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation, either by regulating the Hsp90/CHIP complex directly or by competing as a client protein with tau for binding. Akt levels tightly regulate the expression of CHIP, such that, as Akt levels are suppressed, CHIP levels also decrease, suggesting a potential stress response feedback mechanism between ligase and kinase activity. We also show that Akt and the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (PAR1/MARK2), a known tau kinase, interact directly. Akt enhances the activity of PAR1 to promote tau hyperphosphorylation at S262/S356, a tau species that is not recognized by the CHIP/Hsp90 complex. Moreover, Akt1 knockout mice have reduced levels of tau phosphorylated at PAR1/MARK2 consensus sites. Hence, Akt serves as a major regulator of tau biology by manipulating both tau kinases and protein quality control, providing a link to several common pathways that have demonstrated dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease."

Our earlier report [Padilla PI, Pancheco-Rodriguez G, Moss J, Vaughan M (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:2752-2757] that BIG1 concentrated in nucleoli of serum-starved HepG2 cells prompted us to identify molecules associated with BIG1 in dynamic nucleolar structures. Antibodies against BIG1 or nucleolin coprecipitated both proteins from nuclei, which was abolished by the incubation of nuclei with RNase A or DNase, indicating that the interaction depended on nucleic acids. (32)P labeling of RNAs immunoprecipitated with BIG1 or nucleolin from nuclei revealed bands of approximately 210 bases that also hybridized with U3 small nucleolar (sno)RNA-specific oligonucleotides. Clones of U3 snoRNA cDNAs from the material precipitated by antibodies against BIG1 or nucleolin yielded identical nucleotide sequences that also were found in genomic DNA. Later analyses revealed the presence of fibrillarin, nucleoporin p62, and La in BIG1 and nucleolin immunoprecipitates. Our data demonstrate that BIG1, nucleolin, U3, the U3-binding protein fibrillarin, and the RNA-binding protein La may exist together in nuclear complexes, consistent with a potential role for BIG1 in nucleolar processes. Evidence that BIG1 and nucleolin, but not fibrillarin, can be present with p62 at the nuclear envelope confirms the presence of BIG1 and nucleolin in dynamic molecular complexes that change in composition while moving through nuclei. Nuclear functions of BIG1 remain to be determined."
19592512,0,Development,8701744,2008,An Arabidopsis F-box protein acts as a transcriptional co-factor to regulate floral development.,"Plants flower in response to both environmental and endogenous signals. The Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) transcription factor is crucial in integrating these signals, and acts in part by activating the expression of multiple floral homeotic genes. LFY-dependent activation of the homeotic APETALA3 (AP3) gene requires the activity of UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO), an F-box component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase, yet how this regulation is effected has remained unclear. Here, we show that UFO physically interacts with LFY both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction is necessary to recruit UFO to the AP3 promoter. Furthermore, a transcriptional repressor domain fused to UFO reduces endogenous LFY activity in plants, supporting the idea that UFO acts as part of a transcriptional complex at the AP3 promoter. Moreover, chemical or genetic disruption of proteasome activity compromises LFY-dependent AP3 activation, indicating that protein degradation is required to promote LFY activity. These results define an unexpected role for an F-box protein in functioning as a DNA-associated transcriptional co-factor in regulating floral homeotic gene expression. These results suggest a novel mechanism for promoting flower development via protein degradation and concomitant activation of the LFY transcription factor. This mechanism may be widely conserved, as homologs of UFO and LFY have been identified in a wide array of plant species."

We now report the crystal structure at 2.1 A resolution of an alpha/beta-type SASP bound to a 10-bp DNA duplex. In the complex, the alpha/beta-type SASP adopt a helix-turn-helix motif, interact with DNA through minor groove contacts, bind to approximately 6 bp of DNA as a dimer, and the DNA is in an A-B type conformation. The structure of the complex provides important insights into the molecular details of both DNA and alpha/beta-type SASP protection in the complex and thus also in spores."

We have identified a receptor, PDC-TREM, which is associated with Plexin-A1 (PlxnA1) on the PDC cell surface and is preferentially expressed after TLR-stimulation. Limited TLR signals induced PDC-TREM expression but failed to induce IFN-alpha production. However, when coupled with Sema6D, a ligand for Plexin-A1, limited TLR-stimulation resulted in PDC-TREM-mediated DAP12-dependent phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2 at 6-9 h, and IFN-alpha was produced. Inhibition of PDC-TREM expression by pdctrem-shRNA, blocking of PDC-TREM-binding with PlxnA1 by PDC-TREM mAb, and DAP12 deficiency all resulted in greatly reduced PDC-TREM-dependent activation of signaling molecules and IFN-alpha production. Thus, PDC-TREM is responsible for IFN-alpha production, whereas TLR signals are essential for PDC-TREM expression."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Inhibition of proinflammatory and innate immune signaling pathways by a cytomegalovirus RIP1-interacting protein.,"TNFalpha is an important cytokine in antimicrobial immunity and inflammation. The receptor-interacting protein RIP1 is an essential component of the TNF receptor 1 signaling pathway that mediates the activation of NF-kappaB, MAPKs, and programmed cell death. It also transduces signals derived from Toll-like receptors and intracellular sensors of DNA damage and double-stranded RNA. Here, we show that the murine CMV M45 protein binds to RIP1 and inhibits TNFalpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB, p38 MAPK, and caspase-independent cell death. M45 also inhibited NF-kappaB activation upon stimulation of Toll-like receptor 3 and ubiquitination of RIP1, which is required for NF-kappaB activation. Hence, M45 functions as a viral inhibitor of RIP1-mediated signaling. The results presented here reveal a mechanism of viral immune subversion and demonstrate how a viral protein can simultaneously block proinflammatory and innate immune signaling pathways by interacting with a central mediator molecule."

Here, we show that Bcl10 undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitination in response to T cell activation and subsequently binds NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. This interaction requires the ubiquitin-binding activity of NEMO. The sites of Bcl10 ubiquitination were mapped to K31 and K63. Mutation of these residues did not affect TCR signaling-induced CBM complex assembly but prevented Bcl10 ubiquitination, NEMO binding, and NF-kappaB activation. Therefore, the regulated ubiquitination of Bcl10 and its recognition by NEMO are a critical link between the CBM complex, IKK recruitment, and NF-kappaB activation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,CNK and HYP form a discrete dimer by their SAM domains to mediate RAF kinase signaling.,"RAF kinase functions in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to transmit growth signals to the downstream kinases MEK and ERK. Activation of RAF catalytic activity is facilitated by a regulatory complex comprising the proteins CNK (Connector enhancer of KSR), HYP (Hyphen), and KSR (Kinase Suppressor of Ras). The sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain found in both CNK and HYP plays an essential role in complex formation. Here, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of the SAM domain of CNK in complex with the SAM domain of HYP. The structure reveals a single-junction SAM domain dimer of 1:1 stoichiometry in which the binding mode is a variation of polymeric SAM domain interactions. Through in vitro and in vivo mutational analyses, we show that the specific mode of dimerization revealed by the crystal structure is essential for RAF signaling and facilitates the recruitment of KSR to form the CNK/HYP/KSR regulatory complex. We present two docking-site models to account for how SAM domain dimerization might influence the formation of a higher-order CNK/HYP/KSR complex."

Five patients made high-titer antibodies against adenovirus and three made IgG reactive with a leukemia-associated surface antigen, which we identified as ROR1. Anti-ROR1 antibodies were not detected in the sera of untreated patients. We generated anti-ROR1 mAbs and found they reacted specifically with the CLL cells of all patients, but not with nonleukemic leukocytes, a wide variety of normal adult tissues, or blood mononuclear cells, including CD5(+) B cells of healthy adults. ROR1 could bind Wnt5a, which induced activation of NF-kappaB when coexpressed with ROR1 in HEK293 cells and enhanced the survival of CLL cells in vitro, an effect that could be neutralized by posttreatment anti-ROR1 antisera. We conclude that patients with CLL can break immune tolerance to ROR1, which is an oncofetal surface antigen and survival-signaling receptor in this neoplastic disease."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The stumpy gene is required for mammalian ciliogenesis.,"Cilia are present on nearly all cell types in mammals and perform remarkably diverse functions. However, the mechanisms underlying ciliogenesis are unclear. Here, we cloned a previously uncharacterized highly conserved gene, stumpy, located on mouse chromosome 7. Stumpy was ubiquitously expressed, and conditional loss in mouse resulted in complete penetrance of perinatal hydrocephalus (HC) and severe polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We found that cilia in stumpy mutant brain and kidney cells were absent or markedly deformed, resulting in defective flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Stumpy colocalized with ciliary basal bodies, physically interacted with gamma-tubulin, and was present along ciliary axonemes, suggesting that stumpy plays a role in ciliary axoneme extension. Therefore, stumpy is essential for ciliogenesis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of human congenital malformations such as HC and PKD."

Release from PD-1 inhibitory signaling revives &quot;exhausted&quot; virus-specific T cells in chronic viral infections. Here we present the crystal structure of murine PD-1 in complex with human PD-L1. PD-1 and PD-L1 interact through the conserved front and side of their Ig variable (IgV) domains, as do the IgV domains of antibodies and T cell receptors. This places the loops at the ends of the IgV domains on the same side of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex, forming a surface that is similar to the antigen-binding surface of antibodies and T cell receptors. Mapping conserved residues allowed the identification of residues that are important in forming the PD-1/PD-L1 interface. Based on the structure, we show that some reported loss-of-binding mutations involve the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction but that others compromise protein folding. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction described here may be blocked by antibodies or by designed small-molecule drugs to lower inhibitory signaling that results in a stronger immune response. The immune receptor-like loops offer a new surface for further study and potentially the design of molecules that would affect PD-1/PD-L1 complex formation and thereby modulate the immune response."

They contribute to sensory function and nociception in the peripheral nervous system, and in the brain they contribute to synaptic plasticity and fear responses. Some of the physiologic consequences of disrupting ASIC genes in mice suggested that ASIC channels might modulate neuronal function by mechanisms in addition to their H(+)-evoked opening. Within ASIC channel's large extracellular domain, we identified sequence resembling that in scorpion toxins that inhibit K(+) channels. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ASIC channels might inhibit K(+) channel function by coexpressing ASIC1a and the high-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) (BK) channel. We found that ASIC1a associated with BK channels and inhibited their current. Reducing extracellular pH disrupted the association and relieved the inhibition. BK channels, in turn, altered the kinetics of ASIC1a current. In addition to BK, ASIC1a inhibited voltage-gated Kv1.3 channels. Other ASIC channels also inhibited BK, although acidosis-dependent relief of inhibition varied. These results reveal a mechanism of ion channel interaction and reciprocal regulation. Finding that a reduced pH activated ASIC1a and relieved BK inhibition suggests that extracellular protons may enhance the activity of channels with opposing effects on membrane voltage. The wide and varied expression patterns of ASICs, BK, and related K(+) channels suggest broad opportunities for this signaling system to alter neuronal function."
19596269,0,PLoS ONE,101285081,2008,Modulation of interleukin-1 transcriptional response by the interaction between VRK2 and the JIP1 scaffold protein.,"BACKGROUND: Cellular biological responses to specific stimulation are determined by a balance among signaling pathways. Protein interactions are likely to modulate these pathways. Vaccinia-related kinase-2 (VRK2) is a novel human kinase that can modulate different signaling pathways. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that in vivo, the activity of JIP1-JNK complexes is downregulated by VRK2 in response to interleukin-1beta. Also the reduction of endogenous VRK2 with shRNA increases the transcriptional response to IL-1beta. The JIP1 scaffold protein assembles three consecutive members of a given MAPK pathway forming signaling complexes and their signal can be modulated by interactions with regulatory proteins that remain to be identified. Knocking-down JIP1 with siRNA resulted in elimination of the AP1 transcriptional response to IL-1beta. VRK2, a member of novel Ser-Thr kinase family, is able to stably interact with JIP1, TAK1 and MKK7, but not JNK, and can be isolated forming oligomeric complexes with different proportions of TAK1, MKK7beta1 and JNK. JIP1 assembles all these proteins in an oligomeric signalosome. VRK2 binding to the JIP1 signalosome prevents the association of JNK and results in a reduction in its phosphorylation and downregulation of AP1-dependent transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work suggests that the intracellular level of VRK2 protein can modulate the flow through a signaling pathway and alter the response from a receptor that can be distributed by more than one pathway, and thus contribute to the cellular specificity of the response by forming alternative signaling complexes. Furthermore, the effect might be more general and affect other signaling routes assembled on the JIP1 scaffold protein for which a model is proposed."

This binary complex has been difficult to characterize by bulk methods because of the prevalence of a 2:1 dead-end species. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence, we find the structure of the 1:1 syntaxin/SNAP-25 binary complex is variable, with states changing on the second timescale. One state corresponds to a parallel three-helix bundle, whereas other states show one of the SNAP-25 SNARE domains dissociated. Adding synaptobrevin suppresses the dissociated helix states. Remarkably, upon addition of complexin, Munc13, Munc18, or synaptotagmin, a similar effect is observed. Thus, the 1:1 binary complex is a dynamic acceptor for synaptobrevin binding, and accessory proteins stabilize this acceptor. In the cellular environment the binary complex is actively maintained in a configuration where it can rapidly interact with synaptobrevin, so formation is not likely a limiting step for neurotransmitter release."

While most members of this enzyme family, such as that from a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp., are involved primarily in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) salvage/recycling pathways, its close homolog in a category-A biodefense pathogen, Francisella tularensis, likely plays a central role in a recently discovered novel pathway of NAD de novo synthesis. The crystal structures of NadM-Nudix from both species, including their complexes with various ligands and catalytic metal ions, revealed detailed configurations of the substrate binding and catalytic sites in both domains. The structure of the N-terminal NadM domain may be exploited for designing new antitularemia therapeutics. The ADPR binding site in the C-terminal Nudix domain is substantially different from that of Escherichia coli ADPR pyrophosphatase, and is more similar to human NUDT9. The latter observation provided new insights into the ligand binding mode of ADPR-gated Ca2+ channel TRPM2."

The ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, viability and development. By combining proteomics and in vivo NEDDylation assays, we identified a subset of ribosomal proteins as novel targets for the NEDD8 pathway. We further show that the lack of NEDDylation in cells causes ribosomal protein instability. Our studies identify a novel and specific role of the NEDD8 pathway in protecting a subset of ribosomal proteins from destabilization."

To explore the structural basis of H-ras membrane organization, we combined molecular dynamic simulations and medium-throughput FRET measurements on live cells. We extracted a set of FRET values, termed a FRET vector, to describe the lateral segregation and orientation of H-ras with respect to a large set of nanodomain markers. We show that mutation of basic residues in helix alpha4 or the hypervariable region (HVR) selectively alter the FRET vectors of GTP- or GDP-loaded H-ras, demonstrating a critical role for these residues in stabilizing GTP- or GDP-H-ras interactions with the plasma membrane. By a similar analysis, we find that the beta2-beta3 loop and helix alpha5 are involved in a novel conformational switch that operates through helix alpha4 and the HVR to reorient the H-ras G-domain with respect to the plasma membrane. Perturbation of these switch elements enhances MAPK activation by stabilizing GTP-H-ras in a more productive signalling conformation.

To address how this domain can bind to disparate recognition mofits and to determine whether this results in variations in substrate-binding affinity, we compared crystal structures of the Cbl-TKB domain complexed with phosphorylated peptides of Sprouty2, Sprouty4, epidermal growth factor receptor, Syk, and c-Met receptors and validated the binding with point-mutational analyses using full-length proteins. An obligatory, intrapeptidyl H-bond between the phosphotyrosine and the conserved asparagine or adjacent arginine is essential for binding and orients the peptide into a positively charged pocket on c-Cbl. Surprisingly, c-Met bound to Cbl in the reverse direction, which is unprecedented for SH2 domain binding. The necessity of this intrapeptidyl H-bond was confirmed with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments that also showed Sprouty2 to have the highest binding affinity to c-Cbl; this may enable the selective sequestration of c-Cbl from other target proteins."
19601625,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Regulation of stress granule dynamics by Grb7 and FAK signalling pathway.,"Cells form stress granules (SGs) in response to environmental stresses, which constitute cytoplasmic domains where mRNAs are stored and translation is halted. Although several components are found in SGs, it is poorly understood as to how SGs are formed and dissolved. We identified growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (Grb7), an RNA-binding, translational regulator, as an integral component of SGs, which directly interacts with Hu antigen R (HuR) and is required for cells to form SGs. When stress is terminated, Grb7 is hyperphosphorylated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK), loses its ability to directly interact with HuR and is dissociated from SG components, thereby disrupting SGs in recovering cells. Consistently, dominant-negative hypophospho mutants of FAK and Grb7 significantly attenuate SG disassembly during recovery. FAK activation followed by its phosphorylating Grb7 constitutes a cell-autonomous signalling pathway that regulates the disassembly of SGs and translational stimulation during recovery. This is the first reported pathway actively regulating the dynamics of SGs."
19601679,0,Development,8701744,2008,Interaction of amyloid precursor protein with contactins and NgCAM in the retinotectal system.,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease, but its actions in normal development are not well understood. Here, a tagged APP ectodomain was used to identify extracellular binding partners in developing chick brain. Prominent binding sites were seen in the olfactory bulb and on retinal axons growing into the optic tectum. Co-precipitation from these tissues and tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of two associated proteins: contactin 4 and NgCAM. In vitro binding studies revealed direct interactions among multiple members of the APP and contactin protein families. Levels of the APP processing fragment, CTFalpha, were modulated by both contactin 4 and NgCAM. In the developing retinotectal system, APP, contactin 4 and NgCAM are expressed in the retina and tectum in suitable locations to interact. Functional assays revealed regulatory effects of both APP and contactin 4 on NgCAM-dependent growth of cultured retinal axons, demonstrating specific functional interactions among these proteins. These studies identify novel binding and functional interactions among proteins of the APP, contactin and L1CAM families, with general implications for mechanisms of APP action in neural development and disease."
19602416,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Reduction of IgG in nonhuman primates by a peptide antagonist of the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn.,"The neonatal Fc receptor FcRn provides IgG molecules with their characteristically long half-lives in vivo by protecting them from intracellular catabolism and then returning them to the extracellular space. Other investigators have demonstrated that mice lacking FcRn are protected from induction of various autoimmune diseases, presumably because of the accelerated catabolism of pathogenic IgGs in the animals. Therefore, targeting FcRn with a specific inhibitor may represent a unique approach for the treatment of autoimmune disease or other diseases where the reduction of pathogenic IgG will have a therapeutic benefit. Using phage display peptide libraries, we screened for ligands that bound to human FcRn (hFcRn) and discovered a consensus peptide sequence that binds to hFcRn and inhibits the binding of human IgG (hIgG) in vitro. Chemical optimization of the phage-identified sequences yielded the 26-amino acid peptide dimer SYN1436, which is capable of potent in vitro inhibition of the hIgG-hFcRn interaction. Administration of SYN1436 to mice transgenic for hFcRn induced an increase in the rate of catabolism of hIgG in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with SYN1436 led to a reduction of IgG by up to 80% without reducing serum albumin levels that also binds to FcRn. SYN1436 and related peptides thus represent a previously uncharacterized family of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of humorally mediated autoimmune and other diseases."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Transthyretin protects Alzheimer's mice from the behavioral and biochemical effects of Abeta toxicity.,"Cells that have evolved to produce large quantities of secreted proteins to serve the integrated functions of complex multicellular organisms are equipped to compensate for protein misfolding. Hepatocytes and plasma cells have well developed chaperone and proteasome systems to ensure that secreted proteins transit the cell efficiently. The number of neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein misfolding suggests that neurons are particularly sensitive to the pathogenic effects of aggregates of misfolded molecules because those systems are less well developed in this lineage. Aggregates of the amyloidogenic (Abeta(1-42)) peptide play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the precise mechanism is unclear. In genetic studies examining protein-protein interactions that could constitute native mechanisms of neuroprotection in vivo, overexpression of a WT human transthyretin (TTR) transgene was ameliorative in the APP23 transgenic murine model of human AD. Targeted silencing of the endogenous TTR gene accelerated the development of the neuropathologic phenotype. Intraneuronal TTR was seen in the brains of normal humans and mice and in AD patients and APP23 mice. The APP23 brains showed colocalization of extracellular TTR with Abeta in plaques. Using surface plasmon resonance we obtained in vitro evidence of direct protein-protein interaction between TTR and Abeta aggregates. These findings suggest that TTR is protective because of its capacity to bind toxic or pretoxic Abeta aggregates in both the intracellular and extracellular environment in a chaperone-like manner. The interaction may represent a unique normal host defense mechanism, enhancement of which could be therapeutically useful."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Crystal structure of tetrameric form of human lysyl-tRNA synthetase: Implications for multisynthetase complex formation.,"In mammals, many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are bound together in a multisynthetase complex (MSC) as a reservoir of procytokines and regulation molecules for functions beyond aminoacylation. The alpha(2) homodimeric lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is tightly bound in the MSC and, under specific conditions, is secreted to trigger a proinflammatory response. Results by others suggest that alpha(2) LysRS is tightly bound into the core of the MSC with homodimeric beta(2) p38, a scaffolding protein that itself is multifunctional. Not understood is how the two dimeric proteins combine to make a presumptive alpha(2)beta(2) heterotetramer and, in particular, the location of the surfaces on LysRS that would accommodate the p38 interactions. Here we present a 2.3-A crystal structure of a tetrameric form of human LysRS. The relatively loose (as seen in solution) tetramer interface is assembled from two eukaryote-specific sequences, one in the catalytic- and another in the anticodon-binding domain. This same interface is predicted to provide unique determinants for interaction with p38. The analyses suggest how the core of the MSC is assembled and, more generally, that interactions and functions of synthetases can be built and regulated through dynamic protein-protein interfaces. These interfaces are created from small adaptations to what is otherwise a highly conserved (through evolution) polypeptide sequence."
19603053,1,Cell Res.,9425763,2008,FIT interacts with AtbHLH38 and AtbHLH39 in regulating iron uptake gene expression for iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis.,"Iron is an essential element for plant growth and development. Iron homeostasis in plants is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Several bHLH transcription factors involved in iron homeostasis have been identified recently. However, their regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor FIT interacted with AtbHLH38 and AtbHLH39 and directly conferred the expression regulation of iron uptake genes for iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that AtbHLH38 or AtbHLH39 interacted with FIT, a central transcription factor involved in iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Expression of FIT/AtbHLH38 or FIT/AtbHLH39 in yeast cells activated GUS expression driven by ferric chelate reductase (FRO2) and ferrous transporter (IRT1) promoters. Overexpression of FIT with either AtbHLH38 or AtbHLH39 in plants converted the expression of the iron uptake genes FRO2 and IRT1 from induced to constitutive. Further analysis revealed that FRO2 and IRT1 were not regulated at the posttranscriptional level in these plants because IRT1 protein accumulation and high ferric chelate reductase activity were detected in the overexpression plants under both iron deficiency and iron sufficiency. The double overexpression plants accumulated more iron in their shoots than wild type or the plants overexpressing either AtbHLH38, AtbHLH39 or FIT. Our data support that ferric-chelate reductase FRO2 and ferrous-transporter IRT1 are the targets of the three transcription factors and the transcription of FRO2 and IRT1 is directly regulated by a complex of FIT/AtbHLH38 or FIT/AtbHLH39."
19603073,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Chemically modified beta-glucuronidase crosses blood-brain barrier and clears neuronal storage in murine mucopolysaccharidosis VII.,"Enzyme replacement therapy has been used successfully in many lysosomal storage diseases. However, correction of brain storage has been limited by the inability of infused enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier. The newborn mouse is an exception because recombinant enzyme is delivered to neonatal brain after mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated transcytosis. Access to this route is very limited after 2 weeks of age. Recently, several studies showed that multiple infusions of high doses of enzyme partially cleared storage in adult brain. These results raised the question of whether correction of brain storage by repeated high doses of enzyme depends on mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated uptake or whether enzyme gains access to brain storage by another route when brain capillaries are exposed to prolonged, high levels of circulating enzyme. To address this question, we used an enzyme whose carbohydrate-dependent receptor-mediated uptake was inactivated by chemical modification. Treatment of human beta-glucuronidase (GUS) with sodium metaperiodate followed by sodium borohydride reduction (PerT-GUS) eliminated uptake by mannose 6-phosphate and mannose receptors in cultured cells and dramatically slowed its plasma clearance from a t(1/2) of &lt;10 min to 18 h. Surprisingly, PerT-GUS infused weekly for 12 weeks was more effective in clearing central nervous system storage than native GUS at the same dose. In fact, PerT-GUS resulted in almost complete reversal of storage in neocortical and hippocampal neurons. This enhanced correction of neuronal storage by long-circulating enzyme, which targets no known receptor, suggests a delivery system across the blood-brain barrier that might be exploited therapeutically."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,PTEN regulates p300-dependent hypoxia-inducible factor 1 transcriptional activity through Forkhead transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a).,"The tumor suppressor PTEN is mutated or deleted in many tumors, causing the activation of the PI3K pathway. Here, we show that the loss of PTEN increases the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) through the inactivation of Forkhead transcription factors (FOXO) in PTEN-null cells. Reintroduction of PTEN into the nucleus, overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable FOXO3a, which accumulates in the nucleus, or inhibition of nuclear export of FOXO3a by leptomycin B represses HIF-1 transcriptional activity in PTEN-null cells. HIF-1 transcriptional activity increases in PTEN-positive cells depleted of FOXO3a with siRNA. PTEN and FOXO3a regulate the transactivation domain of HIF-1alpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that FOXO3a complexes with HIF-1alpha and p300 on the Glut-1 promoter, a HIF-1 target gene. Overexpression of p300 reverses FOXO3a-mediated repression of HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and GAL4-HIF-1alpha transactivation assays reveal that FOXO3a interferes with p300-dependent HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Thus, FOXO3a negatively regulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Structural and biochemical insights into the dicing mechanism of mouse Dicer: a conserved lysine is critical for dsRNA cleavage.,"Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, initiates RNA interference by processing precursor dsRNAs into mature microRNAs and small-interfering RNAs. It is also involved in loading and activation of the RNA-induced silencing complex. Here, we report the crystal structures of a catalytically active fragment of mouse Dicer, containing the RNase IIIb and dsRNA binding domains, in its apo and Cd(2+)-bound forms, at 1.68- and 2.8-A resolution, respectively. Models of this structure with dsRNA reveal that a lysine residue, highly conserved in Dicer RNase IIIa and IIIb domains and in Drosha RNase IIIb domains, has the potential to participate in the phosphodiester bond cleavage reaction by stabilizing the transition state and leaving group of the scissile bond. Mutational and enzymatic assays confirm the importance of this lysine in dsRNA cleavage, suggesting that this lysine represents a conserved catalytic residue of Dicers. The structures also reveals a approximately 45-aa region within the RNase IIIb domain that harbors an alpha-helix at the N-terminal half and a flexible loop at the C-terminal half, features not present in previously reported structures of homologous RNase III domains from either bacterial RNase III enzymes or Giardia Dicer. N-terminal residues of this alpha-helix have the potential to engage in minor groove interaction with dsRNA substrates."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,IKKalpha is a critical coregulator of a Smad4-independent TGFbeta-Smad2/3 signaling pathway that controls keratinocyte differentiation.,"Cell-cycle exit and differentiation of suprabasal epidermal keratinocytes require nuclear IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), but not its protein kinase activity. IKKalpha also is a suppressor of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but its mode of action remains elusive. Postulating that IKKalpha may serve as a transcriptional regulator in keratinocytes, we searched for cell-cycle-related genes that could illuminate this function. IKKalpha was found to control several Myc antagonists, including Mad1, Mad2, and Ovol1, through the association with TGFbeta-regulated Smad2/3 transcription factors and is required for Smad3 recruitment to at least one of these targets. Surprisingly, Smad2/3-dependent Mad1 induction and keratinocyte differentiation are independent of Smad4, the almost universal coregulator of canonical TGFbeta signaling. IKKalpha also is needed for nuclear accumulation of activated Smad2/3 in the epidermis, and Smad2/3 are required for epidermal differentiation. We suggest that a TGFbeta-Smad2/3-IKKalpha axis is a critical Smad4-independent regulator of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation."
19605488,1,Cell,413066,2008,Chloroplastic protein NRIP1 mediates innate immune receptor recognition of a viral effector.,"Plant innate immunity relies on the recognition of pathogen effector molecules by nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immune receptor families. Previously we have shown the N immune receptor, a member of TIR-NB-LRR family, indirectly recognizes the 50 kDa helicase (p50) domain of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) through its TIR domain. We have identified an N receptor-interacting protein, NRIP1, that directly interacts with both N's TIR domain and p50. NRIP1 is a functional rhodanese sulfurtransferase and is required for N to provide complete resistance to TMV. Interestingly, NRIP1 that normally localizes to the chloroplasts is recruited to the cytoplasm and nucleus by the p50 effector. As a consequence, NRIP1 interacts with N only in the presence of the p50 effector. Our findings show that a chloroplastic protein is intimately involved in pathogen recognition. We propose that N's activation requires a prerecognition complex containing the p50 effector and NRIP1."
19605545,0,Cell,413066,2008,Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.,"Expression of an oncogene in a primary cell can, paradoxically, block proliferation by inducing senescence or apoptosis through pathways that remain to be elucidated. Here we perform genome-wide RNA-interference screening to identify 17 genes required for an activated BRAF oncogene (BRAFV600E) to block proliferation of human primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. Surprisingly, we find a secreted protein, IGFBP7, has a central role in BRAFV600E-mediated senescence and apoptosis. Expression of BRAFV600E in primary cells leads to synthesis and secretion of IGFBP7, which acts through autocrine/paracrine pathways to inhibit BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling and induce senescence and apoptosis. Apoptosis results from IGFBP7-mediated upregulation of BNIP3L, a proapoptotic BCL2 family protein. Recombinant IGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) induces apoptosis in BRAFV600E-positive human melanoma cell lines, and systemically administered rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses growth of BRAFV600E-positive tumors in xenografted mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of human skin, nevi, and melanoma samples implicates loss of IGFBP7 expression as a critical step in melanoma genesis."
19605628,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,The nucleolar SUMO-specific protease SENP3 reverses SUMO modification of nucleophosmin and is required for rRNA processing.,"The ubiquitin-like SUMO system functions by a cyclic process of modification and demodification, and recent data suggest that the nucleolus is a site of sumoylation-desumoylation cycles. For example, the tumour suppressor ARF stimulates sumoylation of nucleolar proteins. Here, we show that the nucleolar SUMO-specific protease SENP3 is associated with nucleophosmin (NPM1), a crucial factor in ribosome biogenesis. SENP3 catalyses desumoylation of NPM1-SUMO2 conjugates in vitro and counteracts ARF-induced modification of NPM1 by SUMO2 in vivo. Intriguingly, depletion of SENP3 by short interfering RNA interferes with nucleolar ribosomal RNA processing and inhibits the conversion of the 32S rRNA species to the 28S form, thus phenocopying the processing defect observed on depletion of NPM1. Moreover, mimicking constitutive modification of NPM1 by SUMO2 interferes with 28S rRNA maturation. These results define SENP3 as an essential factor for ribosome biogenesis and suggest that deconjugation of SUMO2 from NPM1 by SENP3 is critically involved in 28S rRNA maturation."
19605696,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Cystatin F is a cathepsin C-directed protease inhibitor regulated by proteolysis.,"Cystatins are a family of naturally occurring cysteine protease inhibitors, yet the target proteases and biological processes they regulate are poorly understood. Cystatin F is expressed selectively in immune cells and is the only cystatin to be synthesised as an inactive disulphide-linked dimeric precursor. Here, we show that a major target of cystatin F in different immune cell types is the aminopeptidase cathepsin C, which regulates the activation of effector serine proteases in T cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils and mast cells. Surprisingly, recombinant cystatin F was unable to inhibit cathepsin C in vitro even though overexpression of cystatin F suppressed cellular cathepsin C activity. We predicted, using structural models, that an N-terminal processing event would be necessary before cystatin F can engage cathepsin C and we show that the intracellular form of cystatin F indeed has a precise N-terminal truncation that creates a cathepsin C inhibitor. Thus, cystatin F is a latent protease inhibitor itself regulated by proteolysis in the endocytic pathway. By targeting cathepsin C, it may regulate diverse immune cell effector functions."
19606210,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,"Interactions between UPF1, eRFs, PABP and the exon junction complex suggest an integrated model for mammalian NMD pathways.","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) represents a key mechanism to control the expression of wild-type and aberrant mRNAs. Phosphorylation of the protein UPF1 in the context of translation termination contributes to committing mRNAs to NMD. We report that translation termination is inhibited by UPF1 and stimulated by cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). UPF1 binds to eRF1 and to the GTPase domain of eRF3 both in its GTP- and GDP-bound states. Importantly, mutation studies show that UPF1 can interact with the exon junction complex (EJC) alternatively through either UPF2 or UPF3b to become phosphorylated and to activate NMD. On this basis, we discuss an integrated model where UPF1 halts translation termination and is phosphorylated by SMG1 if the termination-promoting interaction of PABPC1 with eRF3 cannot readily occur. The EJC, with UPF2 or UPF3b as a cofactor, interferes with physiological termination through UPF1. This model integrates previously competing models of NMD and suggests a mechanistic basis for alternative NMD pathways."

Rho and Rac activation require guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), but the identity of the GEF involved in Wnt-PCP-mediated convergent extension is unknown. Here we report the identification of the weak-similarity GEF (WGEF) gene by a microarray-based screen for notochord enriched genes, and show that WGEF is involved in Wnt-regulated convergent extension. Overexpression of WGEF activated RhoA and rescued the suppression of convergent extension by dominant-negative Wnt-11, whereas depletion of WGEF led to suppression of convergent extension that could be rescued by RhoA or Rho-associated kinase activation. WGEF protein preferentially localized at the plasma membrane, and Frizzled-7 induced colocalization of Dishevelled and WGEF. WGEF protein can bind to Dishevelled and Daam-1, and deletion of the Dishevelled-binding domain generates a hyperactive from of WGEF. These results indicate that WGEF is a component of the Wnt-PCP pathway that connects Dishevelled to Rho activation."

Human phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) has a similar sequence (ABS-1) in its N-terminal region. In the present study, we found that ALG-2 interacts with PLSCR3 expressed in HEK293 cells in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused ALG-2 and an overlay assay using biotin-labeled ALG-2. The GST fusion protein of an alternatively spliced isoform of ALG-2, GST-ALG-2(DeltaGF122), pulled down green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused PLSCR3 but not GFP Alix. Deletion of a region containing ABS-1 was not sufficient to abrogate the binding. A second ALG-2-binding site (ABS-2) was essential for interaction with ALG-2(DeltaGF122). Real-time interaction analyses with a surface plasmon resonance biosensor using synthetic oligopeptides and recombinant proteins corroborated direct Ca(2+)-dependent binding of ABS-1 to ALG-2 and that of ABS-2 to ALG-2 as well as to ALG-2(DeltaGF122). The sequence of ABS-2 contains multiple prolines and two phenylalanines, among which Phe(49) was found to be critical, because its substitution with Ala or Tyr caused a loss of binding ability by pulldown assays using oligopeptide-immobilized beads. ALG-2-interacting proteins were classified into two groups based on binding ability to ALG-2(DeltaGF122): (i) isoform-non-interactive (ABS-1) types, including Alix, annexin A7, annexin A11, and TSG101 and (ii) isoform-interactive (ABS-2) types including PLSCR3, PLSCR4 and Sec31A. GST-pulldown assays using single amino acid-substituted ALG-2 mutants revealed differences in binding specificities between the two groups, suggesting structural flexibility in ALG-2-ligand complex formation."

The HTH motif forms a tetramerization domain that results in an IFN-gammaBP(ECTV)/IFN-gamma complex containing four IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) chains and two IFN-gamma dimers. The structure, combined with biochemical and cell-based assays, demonstrates that IFN-gammaBP(ECTV) tetramers are required for efficient IFN-gamma antagonism."

For many allosteric systems, structural evidence exists of long-range communication among protein domains, but rarely has this communication been traced to a detailed pathway. The thrombin mutant D102N is stabilized in a self-inhibited conformation where access to the active site is occluded by a collapse of the entire 215-219 beta-strand. Binding of a fragment of the protease activated receptor PAR1 to exosite I, 30-A away from the active site region, causes a large conformational change that corrects the position of the 215-219 beta-strand and restores access to the active site. The crystal structure of the thrombin-PAR1 complex, solved at 2.2-A resolution, reveals the details of this long-range allosteric communication in terms of a network of polar interactions."

Two pathways that are integral to setting the balance between cell survival and cell death are controlled by lipid-activated protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and Ca(2+). PKB elicits its effects through the phosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic factors. Ca(2+) stimulates many prodeath pathways, among which is mitochondrial permeability transition. We identified Ca(2+) release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) intracellular channels as a prosurvival target of PKB. We demonstrated that in response to survival signals, PKB interacts with and phosphorylates InsP(3)Rs, significantly reducing their Ca(2+) release activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of InsP(3)Rs by PKB reduced cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli through a mechanism that involved diminished Ca(2+) flux from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria. In glioblastoma cells that exhibit hyperactive PKB, the same prosurvival effect of PKB on InsP(3)R was found to be responsible for the insensitivity of these cells to apoptotic stimuli. We propose that PKB-mediated abolition of InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release may afford tumor cells a survival advantage."

Postsynaptic neuroligins engage in Ca2+-dependent transsynaptic interactions via their extracellular cholinesterase domain with presynaptic neurexins (NRXs). These interactions may be regulated by two short splice insertions (termed A and B) in the NL cholinesterase domain. Here, we present the 3.3-A crystal structure of the ectodomain from NL2 containing splice insertion A (NL2A). The overall structure of NL2A resembles that of cholinesterases, but several structural features are unique to the NL proteins. First, structural elements surrounding the esterase active-site region differ significantly between active esterases and NL2A. On the opposite surface of the NL2A molecule, the positions of the A and B splice insertions identify a candidate NRX interaction site of the NL protein. Finally, sequence comparisons of NL isoforms allow for mapping the location of residues of previously identified mutations in NL3 and NL4 found in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Overall, the NL2 structure promises to provide a valuable model for dissecting NL isoform- and synapse-specific functions."

Overexpression of COUP-TFII prevents adipogenesis, whereas shRNA-mediated reduction of COUP-TFII promotes differentiation, as shown by increased lipid accumulation and elevated expression of fat cell marker proteins. Furthermore, reduction of COUP-TFII allows uncommitted fibroblasts to be differentiated into fat cells. COUP-TFII represses the expression of a number of proadipogenic factors in adipocytes, with direct action noted at the CAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha promoter. We show that COUP-TFII acts downstream of hedgehog signaling and is required for the full antiadipogenic effect of this pathway. This effect is mediated in part by interaction with GATA factors. COUP-TFII and GATA2 are physically associated and repress target gene expression in an additive manner. Taken together, our data demonstrate that COUP-TFII represents an endogenous suppressor of adipogenesis, linking antiadipogenic extracellular signals to the core transcriptional cascade."

Bcl-xL protein inhibits mitochondria-mediated apoptosis but may have other functions in healthy adult neurons in which Bcl-xL is abundant. Here, we report that overexpression of Bcl-xL postsynaptically increases frequency and amplitude of spontaneous miniature synaptic currents in rat hippocampal neurons in culture. Bcl-xL, overexpressed either pre or postsynaptically, increases synapse number, the number and size of synaptic vesicle clusters, and mitochondrial localization to vesicle clusters and synapses, likely accounting for the changes in miniature synaptic currents. Conversely, knockdown of Bcl-xL or inhibiting it with ABT-737 decreases these morphological parameters. The mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), is a GTPase known to localize to synapses and affect synaptic function and structure. The effects of Bcl-xL appear mediated through Drp1 because overexpression of Drp1 increases synaptic markers, and overexpression of the dominant-negative dnDrp1-K38A decreases them. Furthermore, Bcl-xL coimmunoprecipitates with Drp1 in tissue lysates, and in a recombinant system, Bcl-xL protein stimulates GTPase activity of Drp1. These findings suggest that Bcl-xL positively regulates Drp1 to alter mitochondrial function in a manner that stimulates synapse formation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Gain-of-function mutation of GATA-2 in acute myeloid transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia.,"Acquisition of additional genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities other than the BCR/ABL fusion gene is believed to cause disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from chronic phase to blast crisis (BC). To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of progression to BC, we screened DNA samples from CML patients during blast transformation for mutations in a number of transcription factor genes that are critical for myeloid-lymphoid development. In 85 cases of CML blast transformation, we identified two new mutations in the coding region of GATA-2, a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation. A L359V substitution within zinc finger domain (ZF) 2 of GATA-2 was found in eight cases with myelomonoblastic features, whereas an in-frame deletion of 6 aa (delta341-346) spanning the C-terminal border of ZF1 was detected in one patient at myeloid BC with eosinophilia. Further studies indicated that L359V not only increased transactivation activity of GATA-2 but also enhanced its inhibitory effects on the activity of PU.1, a major regulator of myelopoiesis. Consistent with the myelomonoblastic features of CML transformation with the GATA-2 L359V mutant, transduction of the GATA-2 L359V mutant into HL-60 cells or BCR/ABL-harboring murine cells disturbed myelomonocytic differentiation/proliferation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. These data strongly suggest that GATA-2 mutations may play a role in acute myeloid transformation in a subset of CML patients."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Role for Plk1 phosphorylation of Hbo1 in regulation of replication licensing.,"In a search for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1)-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified histone acetyltransferase binding to the origin recognition complex 1 (Hbo1) as a potential Plk1 target. Here, we show that the interaction between Plk1 and Hbo1 is mitosis-specific and that Plk1 phosphorylates Hbo1 on Ser-57 in vitro and in vivo. During mitosis, Cdk1 phosphorylates Hbo1 on Thr-85/88, creating a docking site for Plk1 to be recruited. Significantly, the overexpression of Hbo1 mutated at the Plk1 phosphorylation site (S57A) leads to cell-cycle arrest in the G1/S phase, inhibition of chromatin loading of the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) complex, and a reduced DNA replication rate. Similarly, Hbo1 depletion results in decreased DNA replication and a failure of Mcm complex binding to chromatin, both of which can be partially rescued by the ectopic expression of WT Hbo1 but not Hbo1-S57A. These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylation of Hbo1 may be required for prereplicative complex (pre-RC) formation and DNA replication licensing."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Molecular basis for LDL receptor recognition by PCSK9.,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) posttranslationally regulates hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) by binding to LDLRs on the cell surface, leading to their degradation. The binding site of PCSK9 has been localized to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a complex between PCSK9 and the EGF-A domain of the LDLR. The binding site for the LDLR EGF-A domain resides on the surface of PCSK9's subtilisin-like catalytic domain containing Asp-374, a residue for which a gain-of-function mutation (Asp-374-Tyr) increases the affinity of PCSK9 toward LDLR and increases plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in humans. The binding surface on PCSK9 is distant from its catalytic site, and the EGF-A domain makes no contact with either the C-terminal domain or the prodomain. Point mutations in PCSK9 that altered key residues contributing to EGF-A binding (Arg-194 and Phe-379) greatly diminished binding to the LDLR's extracellular domain. The structure of PCSK9 in complex with the LDLR EGF-A domain defines potential therapeutic target sites for blocking agents that could interfere with this interaction in vivo, thereby increasing LDLR function and reducing plasma LDL-C levels."
19609357,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2008,Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells by the ARC protein.,"We have shown previously that most melanoma cell lines are insensitive to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis, but resistance can be reversed through activation of caspase-4 by inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway. We report in this study that apoptosis was induced by the ER stress inducer thapsigargin or tunicamycin via a caspase-8-mediated pathway in the melanoma cell line Me1007, although the MEK/ERK pathway was activated in this cell line. The high sensitivity of Me1007 to ER stress-induced apoptosis was associated with low expression levels of the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) protein that was expressed at relatively high levels in the resistant melanoma cell lines. Transfection of cDNA encoding ARC into Me1007 cells inhibited both caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin. In contrast, inhibition of ARC by small interfering RNA knockdown sensitized the resistant melanoma cell lines to ER stress-induced apoptosis, which was inhibitable by blockage of caspase-8 activation. Both exogenous and endogenous ARC seemed to predominantly locate to the cytoplasm and mitochondria and could be coimmunoprecipitated with caspase-8. Taken together, ER stress can potentially activate multiple apoptosis signaling pathways in melanoma cells in a context-dependent manner. Whereas the MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in inhibiting ER stress-induced caspase-4 activation, ARC seems to be critical in blocking activation of caspase-8 in melanoma cells subjected to ER stress."
19609359,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,Uteroglobin interacts with the heparin-binding site of fibronectin and prevents fibronectin-IgA complex formation found in IgA-nephropathy.,"Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary renal glomerular disease in the world that has no effective treatment. High levels of circulating IgA-fibronectin (Fn) complexes, characteristically found in IgAN patients, are suggested to cause abnormal deposition of IgA and Fn in the renal glomeruli of these patients causing renal failure. We previously reported that binding of Fn to uteroglobin (UG), a multifunctional anti-inflammatory protein, inhibits Fn-IgA heteromerization. However, the specific site of Fn-UG interaction until now remained unidentified. We report here that UG interacts with the heparin-binding site of Fn and propose that small molecules competing for interaction with this site may reduce the level of circulating Fn-IgA complexes in IgAN."
19609365,1,Cell,413066,2008,Rab and Arl GTPase family members cooperate in the localization of the golgin GCC185.,"GCC185 is a large coiled-coil protein at the trans Golgi network that is required for receipt of transport vesicles inbound from late endosomes and for anchoring noncentrosomal microtubules that emanate from the Golgi. Here, we demonstrate that recruitment of GCC185 to the Golgi is mediated by two Golgi-localized small GTPases of the Rab and Arl families. GCC185 binds Rab6, and mutation of residues needed for Rab binding abolishes Golgi localization. The crystal structure of Rab6 bound to the GCC185 Rab-binding domain reveals that Rab6 recognizes a two-fold symmetric surface on a coiled coil immediately adjacent to a C-terminal GRIP domain. Unexpectedly, Rab6 binding promotes association of Arl1 with the GRIP domain. We present a structure-derived model for dual GTPase membrane attachment that highlights the potential ability of Rab GTPases to reach binding partners at a significant distance from the membrane via their unstructured and membrane-anchored, hypervariable domains."
19609436,0,Cell,413066,2008,Molecular and structural basis of cytokine receptor pleiotropy in the interleukin-4/13 system.,"Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 are cytokines critical to the development of T cell-mediated humoral immune responses, which are associated with allergy and asthma, and exert their actions through three different combinations of shared receptors. Here we present the crystal structures of the complete set of type I (IL-4R alpha/gamma(c)/IL-4) and type II (IL-4R alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-4, IL-4R alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-13) ternary signaling complexes. The type I complex reveals a structural basis for gamma(c)'s ability to recognize six different gamma(c)-cytokines. The two type II complexes utilize an unusual top-mounted Ig-like domain on IL-13R alpha1 for a novel mode of cytokine engagement that contributes to a reversal in the IL-4 versus IL-13 ternary complex assembly sequences, which are mediated through substantially different recognition chemistries. We also show that the type II receptor heterodimer signals with different potencies in response to IL-4 versus IL-13 and suggest that the extracellular cytokine-receptor interactions are modulating intracellular membrane-proximal signaling events."
19609438,0,DNA Repair (Amst.),101139138,2008,Comparative analysis of in vivo interactions between Rev1 protein and other Y-family DNA polymerases in animals and yeasts.,"Eukaryotes are endowed with multiple specialized DNA polymerases, some (if not all) of which are believed to play important roles in the tolerance of base damage during DNA replication. Among these DNA polymerases, Rev1 protein (a deoxycytidyl transferase) from vertebrates interacts with several other specialized polymerases via a highly conserved C-terminal region. The present studies assessed whether these interactions are retained in more experimentally tractable model systems, including yeasts, flies, and the nematode C. elegans. We observed a physical interaction between Rev1 protein and other Y-family polymerases in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, despite the fact that the C-terminal region of Drosophila and yeast Rev1 are conserved from vertebrates to a similar extent, such interactions were not observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. With respect to regions in specialized DNA polymerases that are required for interaction with Rev1, we find predicted disorder to be an underlying structural commonality. The results of this study suggest that special consideration should be exercised when making mechanistic extrapolations regarding translesion DNA synthesis from one eukaryotic system to another."
19610142,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Inflammatory cardiac valvulitis in TAX1BP1-deficient mice through selective NF-kappaB activation.,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a key mediator of inflammation. Unchecked NF-kappaB signalling can engender autoimmune pathologies and cancers. Here, we show that Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) is a negative regulator of TNF-alpha- and IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation and that binding to mono- and polyubiquitin by a ubiquitin-binding Zn finger domain in TAX1BP1 is needed for TRAF6 association and NF-kappaB inhibition. Mice genetically knocked out for TAX1BP1 are born normal, but develop age-dependent inflammatory cardiac valvulitis, die prematurely, and are hypersensitive to low doses of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. TAX1BP1-/- cells are more highly activated for NF-kappaB than control cells when stimulated with TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. Mechanistically, TAX1BP1 acts in NF-kappaB signalling as an essential adaptor between A20 and its targets."
19610150,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Phosphorylation of Skp2 regulated by CDK2 and Cdc14B protects it from degradation by APC(Cdh1) in G1 phase.,"The p27(Kip1) ubiquitin ligase receptor Skp2 is often overexpressed in human tumours and displays oncogenic properties. The activity of SCF(Skp2) is regulated by the APC(Cdh1), which targets Skp2 for degradation. Here we show that Skp2 phosphorylation on Ser64/Ser72 positively regulates its function in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser64, and to a lesser extent Ser72, stabilizes Skp2 by interfering with its association with Cdh1, without affecting intrinsic ligase activity. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2-mediated phosphorylation of Skp2 on Ser64 allows its expression in mid-G1 phase, even in the presence of active APC(Cdh1). Reciprocally, dephosphorylation of Skp2 by the mitotic phosphatase Cdc14B at the M --&gt; G1 transition promotes its degradation by APC(Cdh1). Importantly, lowering the levels of Cdc14B accelerates cell cycle progression from mitosis to S phase in an Skp2-dependent manner, demonstrating epistatic relationship of Cdc14B and Skp2 in the regulation of G1 length. Thus, our results reveal that reversible phosphorylation plays a key role in the timing of Skp2 expression in the cell cycle."
19610635,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,The mammalian formin FHOD1 is activated through phosphorylation by ROCK and mediates thrombin-induced stress fibre formation in endothelial cells.,"Formin-family proteins, in the active state, form actin-based structures such as stress fibres. Their activation mechanisms, however, are largely unknown except that mDia and its closely related formins can be activated by direct binding of the small GTPase Rho or Cdc42. Here we show that the Rho-dependent protein kinase ROCK phosphorylates the C-terminal residues Ser1131, Ser1137, and Thr1141 of formin homology domain protein 1 (FHOD1), a major endothelial formin that is normally autoinhibited by intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions. Phosphorylation of FHOD1 at the three residues fully disrupts the autoinhibitory interaction, which culminates in formation of stress fibres. We also demonstrate that, in vascular endothelial cells, thrombin, a vasoactive substance leading to Rho activation, elicits both FHOD1 phosphorylation and stress fibre formation in a ROCK-dependent manner, and that FHOD1 depletion by RNA interference impairs thrombin-induced stress fibre formation. Based on these findings we propose a novel mechanism for activation of formin-family proteins: ROCK, activated by G protein-coupled receptor ligands such as thrombin, directly phosphorylates FHOD1 at the C-terminal region, which renders this formin in the active form, leading to stress fibre formation."
19610671,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Interaction between HMGA1a and the origin recognition complex creates site-specific replication origins.,"In all eukaryotic cells, origins of DNA replication are characterized by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC). How ORC is positioned to sites where replication initiates is unknown, because metazoan ORC binds DNA without apparent sequence specificity. Thus, additional factors might be involved in ORC positioning. Our experiments indicate that a family member of the high-mobility group proteins, HMGA1a, can specifically target ORC to DNA. Coimmunoprecipitations and imaging studies demonstrate that HMGA1a interacts with different ORC subunits in vitro and in vivo. This interaction occurs mainly in AT-rich heterochromatic regions to which HMGA1a localizes. Fusion proteins of HMGA1a and the DNA-binding domain of the viral factor EBNA1 or the prokaryotic tetracycline repressor, TetR, can recruit ORC to cognate operator sites forming functional origins of DNA replication. When HMGA1a is targeted to plasmid DNA, the prereplicative complex is assembled during G(1) and the amount of ORC correlates with the local concentration of HMGA1a. Nascent-strand abundance assays demonstrate that DNA replication initiates at or near HMGA1a-rich sites. Our experiments indicate that chromatin proteins can target ORC to DNA, suggesting they might specify origins of DNA replication in metazoan cells."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Structure of the ROC domain from the Parkinson's disease-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 reveals a dimeric GTPase.,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 contains a Ras of complex proteins (ROC) domain that may act as a GTPase to regulate its protein kinase activity. The structure of ROC and the mechanism(s) by which it regulates kinase activity are not known. Here, we report the crystal structure of the LRRK2 ROC domain in complex with GDP-Mg(2+) at 2.0-A resolution. The structure displays a dimeric fold generated by extensive domain-swapping, resulting in a pair of active sites constructed with essential functional groups contributed from both monomers. Two PD-associated pathogenic residues, R1441 and I1371, are located at the interface of two monomers and provide exquisite interactions to stabilize the ROC dimer. The structure demonstrates that loss of stabilizing forces in the ROC dimer is likely related to decreased GTPase activity resulting from mutations at these sites. Our data suggest that the ROC domain may regulate LRRK2 kinase activity as a dimer, possibly via the C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain as a molecular hinge. The structure of the LRRK2 ROC domain also represents a signature from a previously undescribed class of GTPases from complex proteins and results may provide a unique molecular target for therapeutics in PD."

We sequenced 5,655 bp of the POR gene in a representative population of 842 healthy unrelated individuals in four ethnic groups: 218 African Americans, 260 Caucasian Americans, 179 Chinese Americans, and 185 Mexican Americans. One hundred forty SNPs were detected, of which 43 were found in &gt;/=1% of alleles. Twelve SNPs were in the POR promoter region. Fifteen of 32 exonic variations altered the POR amino acid sequence; 13 of these 15 are previously undescribed missense variations. We found eight indels, only one of which was in the coding region. A previously described variant, A503V, was found on 27.9% of all alleles with some ethnic predilection (19.1% in African Americans, 26.4% in Caucasian Americans, 36.7% Chinese Americans, and 31.0% in Mexican Americans). We built cDNA expression vectors for the 13 previously undescribed missense variants, expressed each protein lacking 27 N-terminal residues in Escherichia coli, and assayed the apparent K(m) and V(max) of each in four assays: reduction of cytochrome c, oxidation of NADPH, 17alpha-hydroxylase activity of P450c17, and 17,20 lyase activity of P450c17. The catalytic activities of several missense mutants differed substantially in these assays, indicating that each POR mutant must be assayed separately with each potential target P450 enzyme. The activity of A503V was reduced to a modest but statistically significant degree in all four assays, suggesting that it may play an important role in interindividual variation in drug response."
19615335,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Down-regulation of NKG2D and NKp80 ligands by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K5 protects against NK cell cytotoxicity.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are important early mediators of host immunity to viral infections. The NK activatory receptors NKG2D and NKp80, both C-type lectin-like homodimeric receptors, stimulate NK cell cytotoxicity toward target cells. Like other herpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) down-regulates MHC class I molecules to avoid detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes but renders cells susceptible to NK cell cytotoxicity. We now show that the KSHV immune evasion gene, K5, reduces cell surface expression of the NKG2D ligands MHC class I-related chain A (MICA), MICB, and the newly defined ligand for NKp80, activation-induced C-type lectin (AICL). Down-regulation of both MICA and AICL requires the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of K5 to target substrate cytoplasmic tail lysine residues. The common MICA *008 allele has a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon and is resistant to down-regulation because of the loss of lysine residues. K5-mediated ubiquitylation signals internalization but not degradation of MICA and causes a potent reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The down-regulation of ligands for both the NKG2D and NKp80 activation pathways provides KSHV with a powerful mechanism for evasion of NK cell antiviral functions."
19616851,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Characterization of Arabidopsis and rice DWD proteins and their roles as substrate receptors for CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.,"A subset of WD40 proteins that contain a DWD motif (for DDB1 binding WD40) is reported to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (for Damaged DNA Binding 1-Cullin 4-Regulator of Cullins 1) based E3 ubiquitin ligases in humans. Here, we report 85 Arabidopsis thaliana and 78 rice (Oryza sativa) proteins containing the conserved 16-amino acid DWD motif. We show by yeast two-hybrid and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation that 11 Arabidopsis DWD proteins directly interact with DDB1 and thus may serve as substrate receptors for the DDB1-CUL4 machinery. We further examine whether the DWD protein PRL1 (for Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1) may act as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase. PRL1 directly interacts with DDB1, and prl1 and cul4cs mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, including altered responses to a variety of stimuli. Moreover, AKIN10 (for Arabidopsis SNF1 Kinase Homolog 10) was degraded more slowly in cell extracts of prl1 and cul4cs than in cell extracts of the wild type. Thus, both genetic and biochemical analyses support the conclusion that PRL1 is the substrate receptor of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10. This work adds a large new family to the current portfolio of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases."
19617370,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Cohesins localize with CTCF at the KSHV latency control region and at cellular c-myc and H19/Igf2 insulators.,"Cohesins, which mediate sister chromatin cohesion, and CTCF, which functions at chromatin boundaries, play key roles in the structural and functional organization of chromosomes. We examined the binding of these two factors on the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episome during latent infection and found a striking colocalization within the control region of the major latency transcript responsible for expressing LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), vFLIP (ORF71), and vmiRNAs. Deletion of the CTCF-binding site from the viral genome disrupted cohesin binding, and crippled colony formation in 293 cells. Clonal instability correlated with elevated expression of lytic cycle gene products, notably the neighbouring promoter for K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). siRNA depletion of RAD21 from latently infected cells caused an increase in K14 and ORF74, and lytic inducers caused a rapid dissociation of RAD21 from the viral genome. RAD21 and SMC1 also associate with the cellular CTCF sites at mammalian c-myc promoter and H19/Igf2 imprinting control region. We conclude that cohesin subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene regulation and chromatin organization."
19617395,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2008,MYB72 is required in early signaling steps of rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance in Arabidopsis.,"Colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots by nonpathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r bacteria triggers a jasmonate/ethylene-dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) that is effective against a broad range of pathogens. Microarray analysis revealed that the R2R3-MYB-like transcription factor gene MYB72 is specifically activated in the roots upon colonization by WCS417r. Here, we show that T-DNA knockout mutants myb72-1 and myb72-2 are incapable of mounting ISR against the pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, Hyaloperonospora parasitica, Alternaria brassicicola, and Botrytis cinerea, indicating that MYB72 is essential to establish broad-spectrum ISR. Overexpression of MYB72 did not result in enhanced resistance against any of the pathogens tested, demonstrating that MYB72 is not sufficient for the expression of ISR. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that MYB72 physically interacts in vitro with the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-LIKE3 transcription factor EIL3, linking MYB72 function to the ethylene response pathway. However, WCS417r activated MYB72 in ISR-deficient, ethylene-insensitive ein2-1 plants. Moreover, exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate induced wild-type levels of resistance in myb72-1, suggesting that MYB72 acts upstream of ethylene in the ISR pathway. Collectively, this study identified the transcriptional regulator MYB72 as a novel ISR signaling component that is required in the roots during early signaling steps of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR."
19617628,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Regulation of Escherichia coli SOS mutagenesis by dimeric intrinsically disordered umuD gene products.,"Products of the umuD gene in Escherichia coli play key roles in coordinating the switch from accurate DNA repair to mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) during the SOS response to DNA damage. Homodimeric UmuD(2) is up-regulated 10-fold immediately after damage, after which slow autocleavage removes the N-terminal 24 amino acids of each UmuD. The remaining fragment, UmuD'(2), is required for mutagenic TLS. The small proteins UmuD(2) and UmuD'(2) make a large number of specific protein-protein contacts, including three of the five known E. coli DNA polymerases, parts of the replication machinery, and RecA recombinase. We show that, despite forming stable homodimers, UmuD(2) and UmuD'(2) have circular dichroism (CD) spectra with almost no alpha-helix or beta-sheet signal at physiological concentrations in vitro. High protein concentrations, osmolytic crowding agents, and specific interactions with a partner protein can produce CD spectra that resemble the expected beta-sheet signature. A lack of secondary structure in vitro is characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), many of which act as regulators. A stable homodimer that lacks significant secondary structure is unusual but not unprecedented. Furthermore, previous single-cysteine cross-linking studies of UmuD(2) and UmuD'(2) show that they have a nonrandom structure at physiologically relevant concentrations in vitro. Our results offer insights into structural characteristics of relatively poorly understood IDPs and provide a model for how the umuD gene products can regulate diverse aspects of the bacterial SOS response."
19618953,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Signal processing by its coil zipper domain activates IKK gamma.,"NF-kappaB activation occurs upon degradation of its inhibitor I-kappaB and requires prior phosphorylation of the inhibitor by I-kappaB kinase (IKK). Activity of IKK is governed by its noncatalytic subunit IKKgamma. Signaling defects due to missense mutations in IKKgamma have been correlated to its inability to either become ubiquitylated or bind ubiquitin noncovalently. Because the relative contribution of these events to signaling had remained unknown, we have studied mutations in the coil-zipper (CoZi) domain of IKKgamma that either impair signaling or cause constitutive NF-kappaB activity. Certain signaling-deficient alleles neither bound ubiquitin nor were they ubiquitylated by TRAF6. Introducing an activating mutation into those signaling-impaired alleles restored their ubiquitylation and created mutants constitutively activating NF-kappaB without repairing the ubiquitin-binding defect. Constitutive activity therefore arises downstream of ubiquitin binding but upstream of ubiquitylation. Such constitutive activity reveals a signal-processing function for IKKgamma beyond that of a mere ubiquitin-binding adaptor. We propose that this signal processing may involve homophilic CoZi interactions as suggested by the enhanced affinity of CoZi domains from constitutively active IKKgamma."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The Rho5 GTPase is necessary for oxidant-induced cell death in budding yeast.,"In both animal and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as byproducts of metabolism and upon exposure to diverse environmental stresses. Cellular defense systems operate to avoid molecular damage caused by ROS, but the redox balance is disturbed under excessive stress. Cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo apoptotic-like cell death upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Here, we report that the Rho5 GTPase of budding yeast is necessary for H(2)O(2)-induced cell death, which accompanies ROS accumulation and DNA fragmentation. Unlike WT, a rho5 deletion mutant (rho5Delta) exhibits little cell death, whereas the constitutively active rho5(G12V) mutant exhibits excess ROS accumulation and increased cell death upon H(2)O(2) treatment. Consistent with a role in the oxidative stress response, Rho5 interacts with the thioredoxin reductase Trr1, a key component of the cytoplasmic thioredoxin antioxidant system, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction occurs on the vacuolar membrane before exposure to H(2)O(2) but also in the vacuolar lumen after H(2)O(2) treatment. Trr1 levels are elevated in rho5Delta cells but are elevated only slightly in WT and not in the rho5(G12V) cells after H(2)O(2) treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that Rho5 mediates H(2)O(2)-induced cell death by regulating the level of Trr1 or by excluding Trr1 from its cytoplasmic substrate."

There are no reported channel structures to match the wealth of functional data on the non-voltage-gated members. We determined the structure of the transmembrane regions of the bacterial cyclic nucleotide-regulated channel MlotiK1, a non-voltage-gated 6 TM channel. The structure showed how the S1-S4 domain and its associated linker can serve as a clamp to constrain the gate of the pore and possibly function in concert with ligand-binding domains to regulate the opening of the pore. The structure also led us to hypothesize a new mechanism by which motions of the S6 inner helices can gate the ion conduction pathway at a position along the pore closer to the selectivity filter than the canonical helix bundle crossing."

The A41 protein shares sequence similarity with another VACV protein that binds CC chemokines (called vCKBP, or viral CC chemokine inhibitor, vCCI), and strains of VACV lacking the A41L gene induced stronger CD8+ T-cell responses than control viruses expressing A41. Using surface plasmon resonance, we screened 39 human and murine chemokines and identified CCL21, CCL25, CCL26 and CCL28 as A41 ligands, with Kds of between 8 nM and 118 nM. Nonetheless, A41 was ineffective at inhibiting chemotaxis induced by these chemokines, indicating it did not block the interaction of these chemokines with their receptors. However the interaction of A41 and chemokines was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin, suggesting that A41 and heparin bind to overlapping sites on these chemokines. To better understand the mechanism of action of A41 its crystal structure was solved to 1.9 A resolution. The protein has a globular beta sandwich structure similar to that of the poxvirus vCCI family of proteins, but there are notable structural differences, particularly in surface loops and electrostatic charge distribution. Structural modelling suggests that the binding paradigm as defined for the vCCI-chemokine interaction is likely to be conserved between A41 and its chemokine partners. Additionally, sequence analysis of chemokines binding to A41 identified a signature for A41 binding. The biological and structural data suggest that A41 functions by forming moderately strong (nM) interactions with certain chemokines, sufficient to interfere with chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions at the cell surface (microM-nM) and thereby to destroy the chemokine concentration gradient, but not strong enough to disrupt the (pM) chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions."
19619511,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2008,Binding of pyruvate dehydrogenase to the core of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.,"In human (h) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is bound to the E1-binding domain of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2). The C-terminal surface of the E1beta subunit was scanned for the negatively charged residues involved in binding with E2. betaD289 of hE1 interacts with K276 of hE2 in a manner similar to the corresponding interaction in Bacillus stearothermophilus PDC. In contrast to bacterial E1beta, the C-terminal residue of the hE1beta does not participate in the binding with positively charged residues of hE2. This latter finding shows species specificity in the interaction between hE1beta and hE2 in PDC."
19619546,1,Plant Cell,9208688,2008,Membrane association of the Arabidopsis ARF exchange factor GNOM involves interaction of conserved domains.,"The GNOM protein plays a fundamental role in Arabidopsis thaliana development by regulating endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking required for polar localization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1. GNOM is a family member of large ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs), which regulate vesicle formation by activating ARF GTPases on specific membranes in animals, plants, and fungi. However, apart from the catalytic exchange activity of the SEC7 domain, the functional significance of other conserved domains is virtually unknown. Here, we show that a distinct N-terminal domain of GNOM mediates dimerization and in addition interacts heterotypically with two other conserved domains in vivo. In contrast with N-terminal dimerization, the heterotypic interaction is essential for GNOM function, as mutations abolishing this interaction inactivate the GNOM protein and compromise its membrane association. Our results suggest a general model of large ARF-GEF function in which regulated changes in protein conformation control membrane association of the exchange factor and, thus, activation of ARFs."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,BiP mutants that are unable to interact with endoplasmic reticulum DnaJ proteins provide insights into interdomain interactions in BiP.,"The heat shock protein (Hsp)70 family of molecular chaperones interacts with unfolded proteins through a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) that is controlled by nucleotide binding to the N-terminal domain. The ATPase cycle is regulated by cochaperones, including DnaJ proteins that accelerate ATP hydrolysis to stabilize the Hsp70-substrate complex. We found that R197 in hamster BiP, which resides at the surface of the nucleotide-binding domain, is critical for both association with endoplasmic reticulum DnaJ proteins and interaction with the SBD. Decreasing the positive charge at this residue enhanced basal ATPase activity, destabilized interaction with the SBD, and reduced substrate release both in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of three glutamic acids in the SBD mimicked many of these effects. Our data provide insights into communications between the two domains and suggest a mechanism by which DnaJ proteins increase ATP hydrolysis."

Here, we show that cell stretch leads to activation of the AT(1) receptor, which undergoes an anticlockwise rotation and a shift of transmembrane (TM) 7 into the ligand-binding pocket. As an inverse agonist, candesartan suppressed the stretch-induced helical movement of TM7 through the bindings of the carboxyl group of candesartan to the specific residues of the receptor. A molecular model proposes that the tight binding of candesartan to the AT(1) receptor stabilizes the receptor in the inactive conformation, preventing its shift to the active conformation. Our results show that the AT(1) receptor undergoes a conformational switch that couples mechanical stress-induced activation and inverse agonist-induced inactivation."
19620393,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,DNA-damage response control of E2F7 and E2F8.,"Here, we report that the two recently identified E2F subunits, E2F7 and E2F8, are induced in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents where they have an important role in dictating the outcome of the DNA-damage response. The DNA-damage-dependent induction coincides with the binding of E2F7 and E2F8 to the promoters of certain E2F-responsive genes, most notably that of the E2F1 gene, in which E2F7 and E2F8 coexist in a DNA-binding complex. As a consequence, E2F7 and E2F8 repress E2F target genes, such as E2F1, and reducing the level of each subunit results in an increase in E2F1 expression and activity. Importantly, depletion of either E2F7 or E2F8 prevents the cell-cycle effects that occur in response to DNA damage. Thus, E2F7 and E2F8 act upstream of E2F1, and influence the ability of cells to undergo a DNA-damage response. E2F7 and E2F8, therefore, underpin the DNA-damage response."
19620394,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Structure of the Eps15-stonin2 complex provides a molecular explanation for EH-domain ligand specificity.,"Eps15 homology (EH) domain-containing proteins play a key regulatory role in intracellular membrane trafficking and cell signalling. EH domains serve as interaction platforms for short peptide motifs comprising the residues NPF within natively unstructured regions of accessory proteins. The EH-NPF interactions described thus far are of very low affinity and specificity. Here, we identify the presynaptic endocytic sorting adaptor stonin2 as a high-affinity ligand for the second EH domain (EH2) of the clathrin accessory protein Eps15. Calorimetric data indicate that both NPF motifs within stonin2 interact with EH2 simultaneously and with sub-micromolar affinity. The solution structure of this complex reveals that the first NPF motif binds to the conserved site on the EH domain, whereas the second motif inserts into a novel hydrophobic pocket. Our data show how combination of two EH-attachment sites provides a means for modulating specificity and allows discrimination from a large pool of potential binding partners containing NPF motifs."
19620632,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Crif1 is a novel transcriptional coactivator of STAT3.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcriptional factor that performs a broad spectrum of biological functions in response to various stimuli. However, no specific coactivator that regulates the transcriptional activity of STAT3 has been identified. Here we report that CR6-interacting factor 1 (Crif1) is a specific transcriptional coactivator of STAT3, but not of STAT1 or STAT5a. Crif1 interacts with STAT3 and positively regulates its transcriptional activity. Crif1-/- embryos were lethal around embryonic day 6.5, and manifested developmental arrest accompanied with defective proliferation and massive apoptosis. The expression of STAT3 target genes was markedly reduced in a Crif1-/- blastocyst culture and in Oncostatin M-stimulated Crif1-deficient MEFs. Importantly, the key activities of constitutively active STAT3-C, such as transcription, DNA binding, and cellular transformation, were abolished in the Crif1-null MEFs, suggesting the essential role of Crif1 in the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Our results reveal that Crif1 is a novel and essential transcriptional coactivator of STAT3 that modulates its DNA binding ability, and shed light on the regulation of oncogenic STAT3."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Direct transfer of starter substrates from type I fatty acid synthase to type III polyketide synthases in phenolic lipid synthesis.,"Alkylresorcinols and alkylpyrones, which have a polar aromatic ring and a hydrophobic alkyl chain, are phenolic lipids found in plants, fungi, and bacteria. In the Gram-negative bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, phenolic lipids in the membrane of dormant cysts are essential for encystment. The aromatic moieties of the phenolic lipids in A. vinelandii are synthesized by two type III polyketide synthases (PKSs), ArsB and ArsC, which are encoded by the ars operon. However, details of the synthesis of hydrophobic acyl chains, which might serve as starter substrates for the type III polyketide synthases (PKSs), were unknown. Here, we show that two type I fatty acid synthases (FASs), ArsA and ArsD, which are members of the ars operon, are responsible for the biosynthesis of C(22)-C(26) fatty acids from malonyl-CoA. In vivo and in vitro reconstitution of phenolic lipid synthesis systems with the Ars enzymes suggested that the C(22)-C(26) fatty acids produced by ArsA and ArsD remained attached to the ACP domain of ArsA and were transferred hand-to-hand to the active-site cysteine residues of ArsB and ArsC. The type III PKSs then used the fatty acids as starter substrates and carried out two or three extensions with malonyl-CoA to yield the phenolic lipids. The phenolic lipids in A. vinelandii were thus found to be synthesized solely from malonyl-CoA by the four members of the ars operon. This is the first demonstration that a type I FAS interacts directly with a type III PKS through substrate transfer."
19620977,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,The viral oncoprotein LMP1 exploits TRADD for signaling by masking its apoptotic activity.,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) mediates induction of apoptosis as well as activation of NF-kappaB by cellular TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is also recruited by the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus, but its role in LMP1 signaling has remained enigmatic. In human B lymphocytes, we have generated, to our knowledge, the first genetic knockout of TRADD to investigate TRADD's role in LMP1 signal transduction. Our data from TRADD-deficient cells demonstrate that TRADD is a critical signaling mediator of LMP1 that is required for LMP1 to recruit and activate I-kappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta). However, in contrast to TNFR1, LMP1-induced TRADD signaling does not induce apoptosis. Searching for the molecular basis for this observation, we characterized the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 as an autonomous and unique virus-derived TRADD-binding domain. Replacing the death domain of TNFR1 by LMP1's TRADD-binding domain converts TNFR1 into a nonapoptotic receptor that activates NF-kappaB through a TRAF6-dependent pathway, like LMP1 but unlike wild-type TNFR1. Thus, the unique interaction of LMP1 with TRADD encodes the transforming phenotype of viral TRADD signaling and masks TRADD's pro-apoptotic function."
19621063,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,"Patched, the receptor of Hedgehog, is a lipoprotein receptor.","The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins has a broad variety of functions during metazoan development and implications in human disease. Despite Hh being modified by two lipophilic adducts, Hh migrates far from its site of synthesis and programs cellular outcomes depending on its local concentrations. Recently, lipoproteins were suggested to act as carriers to mediate Hh transport in Drosophila. Here, we examine the role of lipophorins (Lp), the Drosophila lipoproteins, in Hh signaling in the wing imaginal disk, a tissue that does not express Lp but obtains it through the hemolymph. We use the up-regulation of the Lp receptor 2 (LpR2), the main Lp receptor expressed in the imaginal disk cells, to increase Lp endocytosis and locally reduce the amount of available free extracellular Lp in the wing disk epithelium. Under this condition, secreted Hh is not stabilized in the extracellular matrix. We obtain similar results after a generalized knock-down of hemolymph Lp levels. These data suggest that Hh must be packaged with Lp in the producing cells for proper spreading. Interestingly, we also show that Patched (Ptc), the Hh receptor, is a lipoprotein receptor; Ptc actively internalizes Lp into the endocytic compartment in a Hh-independent manner and physically interacts with Lp. Ptc, as a lipoprotein receptor, can affect intracellular lipid homeostasis in imaginal disk cells. However, by using different Ptc mutants, we show that Lp internalization does not play a major role in Hh signal transduction but does in Hh gradient formation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetase regulates its own synthesis by acting as a chaperone to stabilize GlnR-DNA complexes.,"The Bacillus subtilis GlnR repressor controls gene expression in response to nitrogen availability. Because all GlnR-regulated genes are expressed constitutively in mutants lacking glutamine synthetase (GS), GS is required for repression by GlnR. Feedback-inhibited GS (FBI-GS) was shown to activate GlnR DNA binding with an in vitro electophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The activation of GlnR DNA binding by GS in these experiments depended on the feedback inhibitor glutamine and did not occur with mutant GS proteins defective in regulating GlnR activity in vivo. Although stable GS-GlnR-DNA ternary complexes were not observed in the EMSA experiments, cross-linking experiments showed that a protein-protein interaction occurs between GlnR and FBI-GS. This interaction was reduced in the absence of the feedback inhibitor glutamine and with mutant GS proteins. Because FBI-GS significantly reduced the dissociation rate of the GlnR-DNA complexes, the stability of these complexes is enhanced by FBI-GS. These results argue that FBI-GS acts as a chaperone that activates GlnR DNA binding through a transient protein-protein interaction that stabilizes GlnR-DNA complexes. GS was shown to control the activity of the B. subtilis nitrogen transcription factor TnrA by forming a stable complex between FBI-GS and TnrA that inhibits TnrA DNA binding. Thus, B. subtilis GS is an enzyme with dual catalytic and regulatory functions that uses distinct mechanisms to control the activity of two different transcription factors."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,HSP90 regulates cell survival via inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-2.,"Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are abundant, inducible proteins best known for their ability to maintain the conformation of proteins and to refold damaged proteins. Some HSPs, especially HSP90, can be antiapoptotic and the targets of anticancer drugs. Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-2 (IP6K2), one of a family of enzymes generating the inositol pyrophosphate IP7 [diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5-PP-IP5)], mediates apoptosis. Increased IP6K2 activity sensitizes cancer cells to stressors, whereas its depletion blocks cell death. We now show that HSP90 physiologically binds IP6K2 and inhibits its catalytic activity. Drugs and selective mutations that abolish HSP90-IP6K2 binding elicit activation of IP6K2, leading to cell death. Thus, the prosurvival actions of HSP90 reflect the inhibition of IP6K2, suggesting that selectively blocking this interaction could provide effective and safer modes of chemotherapy."

The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system and, upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, specifically binds to and aberrantly activates SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, a bona fide oncoprotein in human malignancies. CagA also elicits junctional and polarity defects in epithelial cells by interacting with and inhibiting partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) independently of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation. Despite these CagA activities that contribute to neoplastic transformation, a causal link between CagA and in vivo oncogenesis remains unknown. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type or phosphorylation-resistant CagA throughout the body or predominantly in the stomach. Wild-type CagA transgenic mice showed gastric epithelial hyperplasia and some of the mice developed gastric polyps and adenocarcinomas of the stomach and small intestine. Systemic expression of wild-type CagA further induced leukocytosis with IL-3/GM-CSF hypersensitivity and some mice developed myeloid leukemias and B cell lymphomas, the hematological malignancies also caused by gain-of-function SHP-2 mutations. Such pathological abnormalities were not observed in transgenic mice expressing phosphorylation-resistant CagA. These results provide first direct evidence for the role of CagA as a bacterium-derived oncoprotein (bacterial oncoprotein) that acts in mammals and further indicate the importance of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, which enables CagA to deregulate SHP-2, in the development of H. pylori-associated neoplasms."
19622761,0,Cell,413066,2008,"PTRF-Cavin, a conserved cytoplasmic protein required for caveola formation and function.","Caveolae are abundant cell-surface organelles involved in lipid regulation and endocytosis. We used comparative proteomics to identify PTRF (also called Cav-p60, Cavin) as a putative caveolar coat protein. PTRF-Cavin selectively associates with mature caveolae at the plasma membrane but not Golgi-localized caveolin. In prostate cancer PC3 cells, and during development of zebrafish notochord, lack of PTRF-Cavin expression correlates with lack of caveolae, and caveolin resides on flat plasma membrane. Expression of PTRF-Cavin in PC3 cells is sufficient to cause formation of caveolae. Knockdown of PTRF-Cavin reduces caveolae density, both in mammalian cells and in the zebrafish. Caveolin remains on the plasma membrane in PTRF-Cavin knockdown cells but exhibits increased lateral mobility and accelerated lysosomal degradation. We conclude that PTRF-Cavin is required for caveola formation and sequestration of mobile caveolin into immobile caveolae."
19622804,1,Cell,413066,2008,Dissecting the ER-associated degradation of a misfolded polytopic membrane protein.,"It remains unclear how misfolded membrane proteins are selected and destroyed during endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). For example, chaperones are thought to solubilize aggregation-prone motifs, and some data suggest that these proteins are degraded at the ER. To better define how membrane proteins are destroyed, the ERAD of Ste6p(*), a 12 transmembrane protein, was reconstituted. We found that specific Hsp70/40s act before ubiquitination and facilitate Ste6p(*) association with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggesting an active role for chaperones. Furthermore, polyubiquitination was a prerequisite for retrotranslocation, which required the Cdc48 complex and ATP. Surprisingly, the substrate was soluble, and extraction was independent of a ubiquitin chain extension enzyme (Ufd2p). However, Ufd2p increased the degree of ubiquitination and facilitated degradation. These data indicate that polytopic membrane proteins can be extracted from the ER, and define the point of action of chaperones and the requirement for Ufd2p during membrane protein quality control."
19623174,0,Cell,413066,2008,Structure of the dual enzyme Ire1 reveals the basis for catalysis and regulation in nonconventional RNA splicing.,"Ire1 is an ancient transmembrane sensor of ER stress with dual protein kinase and ribonuclease activities. In response to ER stress, Ire1 catalyzes the splicing of target mRNAs in a spliceosome-independent manner. We have determined the crystal structure of the dual catalytic region of Ire1at 2.4 A resolution, revealing the fusion of a domain, which we term the KEN domain, to the protein kinase domain. Dimerization of the kinase domain composes a large catalytic surface on the KEN domain which carries out ribonuclease function. We further show that signal induced trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain permits unfettered binding of nucleotide, which in turn promotes dimerization to compose the ribonuclease active site. Comparison of Ire1 to a topologically disparate ribonuclease reveals the convergent evolution of their catalytic mechanism. These findings provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of action of RNaseL and other pseudokinases, which represent 10% of the human kinome."
19625255,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,SAGA-mediated H2B deubiquitination controls the development of neuronal connectivity in the Drosophila visual system.,"Nonstop, which has previously been shown to have homology to ubiquitin proteases, is required for proper termination of axons R1-R6 in the optic lobe of the developing Drosophila eye. Herein, we establish that Nonstop actually functions as an ubiquitin protease to control the levels of ubiquitinated histone H2B in flies. We further establish that Nonstop is the functional homolog of yeast Ubp8, and can substitute for Ubp8 function in yeast cells. In yeast, Ubp8 activity requires Sgf11. We show that in Drosophila, loss of Sgf11 function causes similar photoreceptor axon-targeting defects as loss of Nonstop. Ubp8 and Sgf11 are components of the yeast SAGA complex, suggesting that Nonstop function might be mediated through the Drosophila SAGA complex. Indeed, we find that Nonstop does associate with SAGA components in flies, and mutants in other SAGA subunits display nonstop phenotypes, indicating that SAGA complex is required for accurate axon guidance in the optic lobe. Candidate genes regulated by SAGA that may be required for correct axon targeting were identified by microarray analysis of gene expression in SAGA mutants."
19625297,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Signaling from beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors is defined by differential interactions with PDE4.,"Beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) are highly homologous, yet they play clearly distinct roles in cardiac physiology and pathology. Myocyte contraction, for instance, is readily stimulated by beta1AR but not beta2AR signaling, and chronic stimulation of the two receptors has opposing effects on myocyte apoptosis and cell survival. Differences in the assembly of macromolecular signaling complexes may explain the distinct biological outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that beta1AR forms a signaling complex with a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) in a manner inherently different from a beta2AR/beta-arrestin/PDE complex reported previously. The beta1AR binds a PDE variant, PDE4D8, in a direct manner, and occupancy of the receptor by an agonist causes dissociation of this complex. Conversely, agonist binding to the beta2AR is a prerequisite for the recruitment of a complex consisting of beta-arrestin and the PDE4D variant, PDE4D5, to the receptor. We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with PDEs result in divergent cAMP signals in the vicinity of the two receptors, thus, providing an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor signaling."
19625400,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Rapid and bi-directional regulation of AMPA receptor phosphorylation and trafficking by JNK.,"Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are implicated in various neuropathological conditions. However, physiological roles for JNKs in neurons remain largely unknown, despite the high expression level of JNKs in brain. Here, using bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we identify the AMPA receptor GluR2L and GluR4 subunits as novel physiological JNK substrates in vitro, in heterologous cells and in neurons. Consistent with this finding, GluR2L and GluR4 associate with specific JNK signaling components in the brain. Moreover, the modulation of the novel JNK sites in GluR2L and GluR4 is dynamic and bi-directional, such that phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation are triggered within minutes following decreases and increases in neuronal activity, respectively. Using live-imaging techniques to address the functional consequence of these activity-dependent changes we demonstrate that the novel JNK site in GluR2L controls reinsertion of internalized GluR2L back to the cell surface following NMDA treatment, without affecting basal GluR2L trafficking. Taken together, our results demonstrate that JNK directly regulates AMPA-R trafficking following changes in neuronal activity in a rapid and bi-directional manner."
19625451,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Two distinct pathways of cell death triggered by oxidative damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs.,"Oxidative base lesions, such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), accumulate in nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs under oxidative stress, resulting in cell death. However, it is not known which form of DNA is involved, whether nuclear or mitochondrial, nor is it known how the death order is executed. We established cells which selectively accumulate 8-oxoG in either type of DNA by expression of a nuclear or mitochondrial form of human 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in OGG1-null mouse cells. The accumulation of 8-oxoG in nuclear DNA caused poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-dependent nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas that in mitochondrial DNA caused mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca2+ release, thereby activating calpain. Both cell deaths were triggered by single-strand breaks (SSBs) that had accumulated in the respective DNAs, and were suppressed by knockdown of adenine DNA glycosylase encoded by MutY homolog, thus indicating that excision of adenine opposite 8-oxoG lead to the accumulation of SSBs in each type of DNA. SSBs in nuclear DNA activated PARP, whereas those in mitochondrial DNA caused their depletion, thereby initiating the two distinct pathways of cell death."

Here we report an atypical activation segment architecture in human MPSK1 comprising a beta sheet and a large alpha-helical insertion. Sequence comparisons suggested that similar activation segments exist in all members of the MPSK1 family and in MAST kinases. The consequence of this nonclassical activation segment on substrate recognition was studied using peptide library screens that revealed a preferred substrate sequence of X-X-P/V/I-phi-H/Y-T*-N/G-X-X-X (phi is an aliphatic residue). In addition, we identified the GTPase DRG1 as an MPSK1 interaction partner and specific substrate. The interaction domain in DRG1 was mapped to the N terminus, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation at Thr100 within the GTPase domain. The presented data reveal an atypical kinase structural motif and suggest a role of MPSK1 regulating DRG1, a GTPase involved in regulation of cellular growth."
19625624,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2008,Cryptochromes define a novel circadian clock mechanism in monarch butterflies that may underlie sun compass navigation.,"The circadian clock plays a vital role in monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration by providing the timing component of time-compensated sun compass orientation, a process that is important for successful navigation. We therefore evaluated the monarch clockwork by focusing on the functions of a Drosophila-like cryptochrome (cry), designated cry1, and a vertebrate-like cry, designated cry2, that are both expressed in the butterfly and by placing these genes in the context of other relevant clock genes in vivo. We found that similar temporal patterns of clock gene expression and protein levels occur in the heads, as occur in DpN1 cells, of a monarch cell line that contains a light-driven clock. CRY1 mediates TIMELESS degradation by light in DpN1 cells, and a light-induced TIMELESS decrease occurs in putative clock cells in the pars lateralis (PL) in the brain. Moreover, monarch cry1 transgenes partially rescue both biochemical and behavioral light-input defects in cry(b) mutant Drosophila. CRY2 is the major transcriptional repressor of CLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription in DpN1 cells, and endogenous CRY2 potently inhibits transcription without involvement of PERIOD. CRY2 is co-localized with clock proteins in the PL, and there it translocates to the nucleus at the appropriate time for transcriptional repression. We also discovered CRY2-positive neural projections that oscillate in the central complex. The results define a novel, CRY-centric clock mechanism in the monarch in which CRY1 likely functions as a blue-light photoreceptor for entrainment, whereas CRY2 functions within the clockwork as the transcriptional repressor of a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Our data further suggest that CRY2 may have a dual role in the monarch butterfly's brain-as a core clock element and as an output that regulates circadian activity in the central complex, the likely site of the sun compass."

We now have recreated VWF tubule assembly in vitro, starting with only pure VWF propeptide (domains D1D2) and disulfide-linked dimers of adjacent N-terminal D'D3 domains. Assembly requires low pH and calcium ions and is reversed at neutral pH. Quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of negatively stained images show that tubules contain a repeating unit of one D'D3 dimer and two propeptides arranged in a right-handed helix with 4.2 units per turn. The symmetry and location of interdomain contacts suggest that decreasing pH along the secretory pathway coordinates the disulfide-linked assembly of VWF multimers with their tubular packaging."

In contrast to all previously characterized homotrimeric TNF family members, the mouse GITRL crystal structure reveals a previously unrecognized dimeric assembly that is stabilized via a unique &quot;domain-swapping&quot; interaction. Consistent with its crystal structure, mouse GITRL exists as a stable dimer in solution. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies confirmed the determinants responsible for dimerization and support a previously unrecognized receptor-recognition surface for mouse GITRL that has not been observed for any other TNF family members. Taken together, the unique structural and biochemical behavior of mouse GITRL, along with the unusual domain organization of murine GITR, support a previously unrecognized mechanism for signaling within the TNF superfamily."

Contrary to the current paradigm that all ligands in the TNFSF are trimeric, mGITRL associates as dimer through a unique C terminus tethering arm. Analytical ultracentrifuge studies revealed that in solution, the recombinant mGITRL exists as monomers at low concentrations and as dimers at high concentrations. Biochemical studies confirmed that the mGITRL dimer is biologically active. Removal of the three terminal residues in the C terminus resulted in enhanced receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation than by the wild-type receptor complex. However, deletion of the tethering C-terminus arm led to reduced activity. Our studies suggest that the mGITRL may undergo a dynamic population shift among different oligomeric forms via C terminus-mediated conformational changes. We hypothesize that specific oligomeric forms of GITRL may be used as a means to differentially control GITR receptor signaling in diverse cells."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Visualization of AP-1 NF-kappaB ternary complexes in living cells by using a BiFC-based FRET.,"Protein-protein interactions are essential for maintaining cell structure and for executing almost all cellular processes. Determination of where and how each protein interacts with its partners provides significant insight into proteins' cellular roles. Although several assays, such as FRET and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), have been developed and widely used for visualization and identification of protein interactions in living cells, there is no simple and convenient assay to visualize and identify multiple protein complexes in living cells. Because many signaling molecules often function as ternary complexes, availability of an assay for visualization and identification of ternary complexes will significantly expand the repertoire of protein interaction studies in living cells. By using the Fos-Jun-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) ternary complex as a model and the fluorescent proteins Cerulean and Venus, two mutant proteins of CFP and YFP with better folding and less environment sensitivity, as a donor and acceptor, respectively, we have combined a Venus-based BiFC system with Cerulean to develop a BiFC-based FRET (BiFC-FRET) assay for visualization of ternary complexes in living cells with a conventional three-filter FRET setup. We also have applied the BiFC-FRET to identify a ternary complex formed between Fos-Jun heterodimers and the NF-kappaB subunit, p65. This finding reveals a cross-talk between AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Thus, the BiFC-FRET represents a convenient assay for identification and visualization of ternary complexes in living cells."

U.S.A.,7505876,2008,The TLR3 signaling complex forms by cooperative receptor dimerization.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate immune responses by recognizing pathogen-associated molecules, but the molecular basis for recognition is poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how receptor-ligand interactions lead to the initiation of downstream signaling. Here, we describe the mechanism by which TLR3 recognizes its ligand, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and forms an active signaling complex. We show that dsRNA binds saturably, specifically, and reversibly to a defined ligand-binding site (or sites) on the TLR3 ectodomain (TLR3ecd). Binding affinities increase with both buffer acidity and ligand size. Purified TLR3ecd protein is exclusively monomeric in solution, but through a highly cooperative process, it forms dimers when bound to dsRNA, and multiple TLR3ecd dimers bind to long dsRNA strands. The smallest dsRNA oligonucleotides that form stable complexes with TLR3ecd (40-50 bp) each bind one TLR3ecd dimer, and these are also the smallest oligonucleotides that efficiently activate TLR3 in cells. We conclude that TLR3 assembles on dsRNA as stable dimers and that the minimal signaling unit is one TLR3 dimer."

We now demonstrate that both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-mediated Jak/STAT-dependent astroglial differentiation is impaired due to EZH2-dependent epigenetic silencing of BMP receptor 1B (BMPR1B) in a subset of glioblastoma TICs. Forced expression of BMPR1B either by transgene expression or demethylation of the promoter restores their differentiation capabilities and induces loss of their tumorigenicity. We propose that deregulation of the BMP developmental pathway in a subset of glioblastoma TICs contributes to their tumorigenicity both by desensitizing TICs to normal differentiation cues and by converting otherwise cytostatic signals to proproliferative signals."

The host-cell target of V2, however, remains unknown. Here we show that V2 interacts directly with SlSGS3, the tomato homolog of the Arabidopsis SGS3 protein (AtSGS3), which is known to be involved in the RNA-silencing pathway. SlSGS3 genetically complemented an AtSGS3 mutation and restored RNA silencing, indicating that SlSGS3 is indeed a functional homolog of AtSGS3. A point mutant of V2 that is unable to bind SlSGS3 also lost its ability to suppress RNA silencing, suggesting a correlation between the V2-SlSGS3 interaction in planta and the suppressor activity of V2."

Here we report the identification and characterization of an HP1-interacting protein (Hip). Hip interacts with HP1 in vitro and is associated with HP1 in vivo. This interaction is mediated by at least three independent but similar HP1-binding modules of the Hip protein. Hip and HP1 completely colocalize in the pericentric heterochromatin, and both haplo- and triplo-dosage mutations act as dominant suppressors of position effect variegation. These findings identify a player in heterochromatinization and suggest that Hip cooperates with HP1 in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing."
19629046,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2008,Mechanism of activation of the Formin protein Daam1.,"The Formin proteins are central players in mediating cytoskeletal reorganization and are epistatically positioned in a pathway downstream of Rho activation. These proteins exist in the cytoplasm in an autoinhibited state, which is mediated by intramolecular interactions between the amino-terminal GTPase binding domain (GBD) that encompasses the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and the carboxyl-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). It has been proposed that the binding of Rho within the GBD releases this molecule from autoinhibition by disrupting the DID/DAD interactions. Here we report that Daam1 is not significantly activated by Rho binding but rather by its interaction with Dishevelled (Dvl). Removal of the DAD domain disrupts interactions between Dvl and Daam1, and the binding of Dvl to Daam1 disrupts the interaction between the GBD and DAD that mediates Daam1 autoinhibition. Mutations within or removal of the DAD converts Daam1 into an active protein that can induce Rho activation. We further demonstrate that Dvl synergizes with Daam1 to regulate gastrulation during Xenopus embryogenesis and that expression of activated Daam1 can rescue impaired convergent extension movements resulting from deregulated noncanonical Wnt signaling. Our studies together define the importance of a carboxyl-terminal binding partner, Dvl, that leads to the activation of Daam1."

Besides providing nuclear shape and mechanical stability, lamins are required for chromatin organization, transcription regulation, DNA replication, nuclear assembly, nuclear positioning, and apoptosis. Mutations in human lamins cause many different heritable diseases, affecting various tissues and causing early aging. Although many of these mutations result in nuclear deformation, their effects on lamin filament assembly are unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans has a single evolutionarily conserved lamin protein, which can form stable 10-nm-thick filaments in vitro. To gain insight into the molecular basis of lamin filament assembly and the effects of laminopathic mutations on this process, we investigated mutations in conserved residues of the rod and tail domains that are known to cause various laminopathies in human. We show that 8 of 14 mutant lamins present WT-like assembly into filaments or paracrystals, whereas 6 mutants show assembly defects. Correspondingly, expressing these mutants in transgenic animals shows abnormal distribution of Ce-lamin, abnormal nuclear shape or change in lamin mobility. These findings help in understanding the role of individual residues and domains in laminopathy pathology and, eventually, promote the development of therapeutic interventions."

Here we show that CaMKII constitutively associates with and modulates voltage-gated calcium (Ca(V))2.1 channels that conduct P/Q type Ca(2+) currents and initiate transmitter release. Both exogenous and brain-specific inhibitors of CaMKII accelerate voltage-dependent inactivation, cause a negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, and reduce Ca(2+)-dependent facilitation of Ca(V)2.1 channels. The modulatory effects of CaMKII are reduced by a peptide that prevents binding to Ca(V)2.1 channels but not by a peptide that blocks catalytic activity, suggesting that binding rather than phosphorylation is responsible for modulation. Our results reveal a signaling complex formed by Ca(V)2.1 channels and CaMKII that regulates P/Q-type Ca(2+) current in neurons. We propose an &quot;effector checkpoint&quot; model for the control of Ca(2+) channel fitness for function that depends on association with CaMKII, SNARE proteins, and other effectors of Ca(2+) signals. This regulatory mechanism would be important in presynaptic nerve terminals, where Ca(V)2.1 channels initiate synaptic transmission and CaMKII has noncatalytic effects on presynaptic plasticity."

We have determined that the acidic carboxyl terminus of TFIIEalpha (TFIIEalpha(336-439)) directly binds the amino-terminal PH domain of p62/Tfb1 with nanomolar affinity. NMR mapping and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the TFIIEalpha binding site on p62/Tfb1 is identical to the binding site for the second transactivation domain of p53 (p53 TAD2). In addition, we demonstrate that TFIIEalpha(336-439) is capable of competing with p53 for a common binding site on p62/Tfb1 and that TFIIEalpha(336-439) and the diphosphorylated form (pS46/pT55) of p53 TAD2 have similar binding constants. NMR structural studies reveal that TFIIEalpha(336-439) contains a small domain (residues 395-433) folded in a novel betabetaalphaalphaalpha topology. NMR mapping studies demonstrate that two unstructured regions (residues 377-393 and residues 433-439) located on either side of the folded domain appear to be required for TFIIEalpha(336-439) binding to p62/Tfb1 and that these two unstructured regions are held close to each other in three-dimensional space by the novel structured domain. We also demonstrate that, like p53, TFIIEalpha(336-439) can activate transcription in vivo. These results point to an important interplay between the general transcription factor TFIIEalpha and the tumor suppressor protein p53 in regulating transcriptional activation that may be modulated by the phosphorylation status of p53."
19629177,1,Cell,413066,2007,Architecture of a coat for the nuclear pore membrane.,"The symmetric core of the nuclear pore complex can be considered schematically as a series of concentric cylinders. A peripheral cylinder coating the pore membrane contains the previously characterized, elongated heptamer that harbors Sec13-Nup145C in its middle section. Strikingly, Sec13-Nup145C crystallizes as a hetero-octamer in two space groups. Oligomerization of Sec13-Nup145C was confirmed biochemically. Importantly, the numerous interacting surfaces in the hetero-octamer are evolutionarily highly conserved, further underlining the physiological relevance of the oligomerization. The hetero-octamer forms a slightly curved, yet rigid rod of sufficient length to span the entire height of the proposed membrane-adjacent cylinder. In concordance with the dimensions and symmetry of the nuclear pore complex core, we suggest that the cylinder is constructed of four antiparallel rings, each ring being composed of eight heptamers arranged in a head-to-tail fashion. Our model proposes that the hetero-octamer would vertically traverse and connect the four stacked rings."
19629191,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Cooperative control of striated muscle mass and metabolism by MuRF1 and MuRF2.,"The muscle-specific RING finger proteins MuRF1 and MuRF2 have been proposed to regulate protein degradation and gene expression in muscle tissues. We have tested the in vivo roles of MuRF1 and MuRF2 for muscle metabolism by using knockout (KO) mouse models. Single MuRF1 and MuRF2 KO mice are healthy and have normal muscles. Double knockout (dKO) mice obtained by the inactivation of all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles developed extreme cardiac and milder skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice was maintained throughout the murine life span and was associated with chronically activated muscle protein synthesis. During ageing (months 4-18), skeletal muscle mass remained stable, whereas body fat content did not increase in dKO mice as compared with wild-type controls. Other catabolic factors such as MAFbox/atrogin1 were expressed at normal levels and did not respond to or prevent muscle hypertrophy in dKO mice. Thus, combined inhibition of MuRF1/MuRF2 could provide a potent strategy to stimulate striated muscles anabolically and to protect muscles from sarcopenia during ageing."
19630101,0,J. Virol.,113724,2008,Vaccinia virus A34 glycoprotein determines the protein composition of the extracellular virus envelope.,"The outer envelope of the extracellular form of vaccinia virus contains five virus-encoded proteins, F13, A33, A34, A56, and B5, that, with the exception of A56, are implicated in virus egress or infectivity. A34, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is involved in the induction of actin tails, the release of enveloped virus from the surfaces of infected cells, and the disruption of the virus envelope after ligand binding prior to virus entry. To investigate interactions between A34 and other envelope proteins, a recombinant vaccinia virus (vA34R(HA)) expressing an epitope-tagged version of A34 (A34(HA)) was constructed by appending an epitope from influenza virus hemagglutinin to the C terminus of A34. Complexes of A34(HA) with B5 and A36, but not with A33 or F13, were detected in vA34R(HA)-infected cells. A series of vaccinia viruses expressing mutated versions of the B5 protein was used to investigate the domain(s) of B5 required for interaction with A34. Both the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains of B5 were dispensable for binding to A34. Most of the extracellular domain of B5, which contains four short consensus repeats homologous to complement control proteins, was sufficient for A34 interaction, indicating that both proteins interact through their ectodomains. Immunofluorescence experiments on cells infected with A34-deficient virus indicated that A34 is required for efficient targeting of B5, A36, and A33 into wrapped virions. Consistent with this observation, the envelope of A34-deficient virus contained normal amounts of F13 but decreased amounts of A33 and B5 with respect to the parental WR virus. These results point to A34 as a major determinant in the protein composition of the vaccinia virus envelope."

Chem.,2985121R,2008,Ubiquitination and degradation of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 by WD40 repeat/SOCS box protein WSB-1.,"Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a member of the nuclear protein kinase family, which induces both p53- and CtBP-mediated apoptosis. Levels of HIPK2 were increased by UV irradiation and cisplatin treatment, thereby implying the degradation of HIPK2 in cells under normal conditions. Here, we indicate that HIPK2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the WD40-repeat/SOCS box protein WSB-1, a process that is blocked under DNA damage conditions. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted to identify the proteins that interact with HIPK2. WSB-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was characterized as an HIPK2-interacting protein. The coexpression of WSB-1 resulted in the degradation of HIPK2 via its C-terminal region. Domain analysis of WSB-1 showed that WD40-repeats and the SOCS box were required for its interaction with and degradation of HIPK2, respectively. In support of the degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1, HIPK2 was polyubiquitinated by WSB-1 in vitro and in vivo. The knockdown of endogenous WSB-1 with the expression of short hairpin RNA against WSB-1 increases the stability of endogenous HIPK2 and resulted in the accumulation of HIPK2. The ubiquitination and degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1 was inhibited completely via the administration of DNA damage reagents, including Adriamycin and cisplatin. These findings effectively illustrate the regulatory mechanisms by which HIPK2 is maintained at a low level, by WSB-1 in cells under normal conditions, and stabilized by genotoxic stresses."

This complex in general associates with actin fibers at its cytoplasmic side, organizing the adherens junction (AJ). In epithelial cells, the AJ encircles the cells near their apical surface and forms the &quot;zonula adherens&quot; or &quot;adhesion belt.&quot; The mechanism as to how the cadherin-catenin complex and F-actin cooperate to generate these junctional structures, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that EPLIN (epithelial protein lost in neoplasm; also known as Lima-1), an actin-binding protein, couples with alpha-catenin and, in turn, links the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin. Without EPLIN, this linkage was unable to form. When EPLIN had been depleted in epithelial cells, the adhesion belt was disorganized and converted into zipper-like junctions in which actin fibers were radially arranged. However, nonjunctional actin fibers were not particularly affected by EPLIN depletion. As EPLIN is known to have the ability to suppress actin depolymerization, our results suggest that EPLIN functions to link the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin and simultaneously stabilizes this population of actin fibers, resulting in the establishment of the adhesion belt."

Although each paralog contains a conserved GxxxG dimerization motif, we show here that the syndecan-1 TMD dimerizes weakly, the syndecan-3 and syndecan-4 TMDs each dimerize strongly, and the syndecan-2 TMD dimerizes very strongly. These markedly different levels of self-association suggest that paralog TMDs play different roles in directing functional interactions of each full-length syndecan family member. We further show that each syndecan TMD forms detergent-resistant heteromeric complexes with other paralogs, and that these interactions exhibit selectivity. Although heteromeric interactions among full-length syndecan paralogs have not been reported, we argue that the distinct hierarchy of protein-protein interactions mediated by the syndecan TMDs may give rise to considerable complexity in syndecan function. The demonstration that TMD homodimerization and heterodimerization can be mediated by GxxxG motifs and modulated by sequence context has implications for the signaling mechanisms of other cell surface receptors, including the integrins and the erbB family."

In the heart, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD), mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, requires assembly of AKAP9 (Yotiao) with the I(Ks) potassium channel alpha subunit (KCNQ1). KCNQ1 mutations that disrupt this complex cause type 1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1), one of the potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndromes. Here, we report identification of (i) regions on Yotiao critical to its binding to KCNQ1 and (ii) a single putative LQTS-causing mutation (S1570L) in AKAP9 (Yotiao) localized to the KCNQ1 binding domain in 1/50 (2%) subjects with a clinically robust phenotype for LQTS but absent in 1,320 reference alleles. The inherited S1570L mutation reduces the interaction between KCNQ1 and Yotiao, reduces the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of the channel, eliminates the functional response of the I(Ks) channel to cAMP, and prolongs the action potential in a computational model of the ventricular cardiocyte. These reconstituted cellular consequences of the inherited S1570L-Yotiao mutation are consistent with delayed repolarization of the ventricular action potential observed in the affected siblings. Thus, we have demonstrated a link between genetic perturbations in AKAP and human disease in general and AKAP9 and LQTS in particular."

Yet only approximately one-half of cancers have p53 loss-of-function mutations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism for p53 inactivation by apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), a protein induced in multiple cancer cells. The direct binding in the nucleus of ARC to the p53 tetramerization domain inhibits p53 tetramerization. This exposes a nuclear export signal in p53, triggering Crm1-dependent relocation of p53 to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of endogenous ARC in breast cancer cells results in spontaneous tetramerization of endogenous p53, accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, and activation of endogenous p53 target genes. In primary human breast cancers with nuclear ARC, p53 is almost always WT. Conversely, nearly all breast cancers with mutant p53 lack nuclear ARC. We conclude that nuclear ARC is induced in cancer cells and negatively regulates p53."

Here, we report that pontin, a component of chromatin-remodeling complexes, is SUMO-modified, and that SUMOylation of pontin is an active control mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of pontin on androgen-receptor target genes in prostate cancer cells. Biochemical purification of pontin-containing complexes revealed the presence of the Ubc9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme that underlies its function as an activator. Intriguingly, 5alpha-dihydroxytestosterone treatments significantly increased the SUMOylation of pontin, and SUMOylated pontin showed further activation of a subset of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription and led to an increase in proliferation and growth of prostate cancer cells. These data clearly define a functional model and provide a link between SUMO modification and prostate cancer progression."
19632179,0,Mol. Cell.

As a result, Wrch1 resides mainly in the active, GTP-loaded conformation under normal cellular conditions. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of Wrch1 in fibroblasts resulted in an altered cell morphology visible as a formation of filopodia, a loss of stress fibers, and a reduction in focal adhesions. Here, we show that Wrch1 binds to the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2. The interaction required Wrch1 to be in a GTP conformation and also required an intact N-terminal proline-rich extension as well as an intact effector loop. Wrch1 requires Pyk2 in imposing the cytoskeletal effects, seen as the formation of filopodia, since treatment of cells with a Pyk2-specific small interfering RNA abrogated this response. Interestingly, we found that the presence and activity of Src were needed for the formation of a Wrch1-Pyk2 complex as well as for the Wrch1-induced formation of filopodia. We propose a model in which Pyk2 and Src function to coordinate the Wrch1-dependent effects on cytoskeletal dynamics."

Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation activates NF-kappaB through RICK, a caspase-recruitment domain-containing kinase. However, the mechanism by which RICK activates NF-kappaB in response to Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation is unknown. Here we show that RICK is conjugated with lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains at lysine 209 (K209) located in its kinase domain upon Nod1 or Nod2 stimulation and by induced oligomerization of RICK. Polyubiquitination of RICK at K209 was essential for RICK-mediated IKK activation and cytokine/chemokine secretion. However, RICK polyubiquitination did not require the kinase activity of RICK or alter the interaction of RICK with NEMO, a regulatory subunit of IkappaB kinase (IKK). Instead, polyubiquitination of RICK was found to mediate the recruitment of TAK1, a kinase that was found to be essential for Nod1-induced signaling. Thus, RICK polyubiquitination links TAK1 to IKK complexes, a critical step in Nod1/Nod2-mediated NF-kappaB activation."

The A complex is localized to sites of DNA damage through the UIM domains of RAP80, which bind K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. In this study, we identified an FHA domain RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF8, and an E2-conjugating enzyme known to form K63-polyubiquitin chains, Ubc13, each of which is required to recruit the Brca1 A complex to sites of DNA damage. Rnf8 localizes to sites of DNA damage through an FHA-domain-containing region. We found that Rap80 contains an Abraxas interaction domain [AIR (Abraxas-interacting region)], required for association of Rap80 with Abraxas, Brca1, and Brcc36. Abraxas and Brcc36 associate through coiled-coil domains on each protein. These data suggest a model through which Ubc13 and Rnf8 are recruited to sites of DNA damage through DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation of a chromatin-associated protein and generate polyubiquitin chains that then recruit Rap80 and the entire Brca1 A complex to DNA-damage foci. This sequential E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment constitutes a ubiquitin ligase cascade required for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling."
19632993,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Among MMP-9-expressing cell types, including cancer cells and tumor-associated leukocytes, inflammatory neutrophils appear to provide an important source of MMP-9 for tumor angiogenesis. However, delivery of MMP-9 by neutrophils has not been mechanistically linked to its catalytic activity at the angiogenic site. By using a modified angiogenic model, allowing for a direct analysis of exogenously added cells and their products in collagen onplants grafted on the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo, we demonstrate that intact human neutrophils and their granule contents are highly angiogenic. Furthermore, purified neutrophil MMP-9, isolated from the released granules as a zymogen (proMMP-9), constitutes a distinctly potent proangiogenic moiety inducing angiogenesis at subnanogram levels. The angiogenic response induced by neutrophil proMMP-9 required activation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-free zymogen and the catalytic activity of the activated enzyme. That the high angiogenic potency of neutrophil proMMP-9 is associated with its unique TIMP-free status was confirmed when a generated and purified stoichiometric complex of neutrophil proMMP-9 with TIMP-1 failed to induce angiogenesis. Recombinant human proMMP-9, operationally free of TIMP-1, also induced angiogenesis at subnanomolar levels, but lost its proangiogenic potential when stoichiometrically complexed with TIMP-1. Similar proMMP-9/TIMP-1 complexes, but naturally produced by human monocytic U937 cells and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, did not stimulate angiogenesis. These findings provide biochemical evidence that infiltrating neutrophils, in contrast to other cell types, deliver a potent proangiogenic moiety, i.e., the unencumbered TIMP-free MMP-9."

Coactivator proteins function prominently in these pathways as the conduit to the basic transcriptional machinery. Here we present a high-throughput cell-based screening strategy, termed the &quot;coactivator trap,&quot; to study the functional interactions of coactivators with transcription factors. We applied this strategy to the cAMP signaling pathway, which utilizes two families of coactivators, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/p300 family and the recently identified transducers of regulated CREB activity family (TORCs1-3). In addition to identifying numerous known interactions of these coactivators, this analysis identified NONO (p54(nrb)) as a TORC-interacting protein. RNA interference experiments demonstrate that NONO is necessary for cAMP-dependent activation of CREB target genes in vivo. Furthermore, TORC2 and NONO complex on cAMP-responsive promoters, and NONO acts as a bridge between the CREB/TORC complex and RNA polymerase II.

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein MRAP forms antiparallel homodimers.,"The melanocortin-2 (MC2) receptor accessory protein (MRAP) is required for trafficking of the G protein-coupled MC2 receptor to the plasma membrane. The mechanism of action and structure of MRAP, which has a single transmembrane domain, are unknown. Here, we show that MRAP displays a previously uncharacterized topology. Epitopes on both the N- and C-terminal ends of MRAP were localized on the external face of CHO cells at comparable levels. Using antibodies raised against N- and C-terminal MRAP peptides, we demonstrated that both ends of endogenous MRAP face the outside in adrenal cells. Nearly half of MRAP was glycosylated at the single endogenous N-terminal glycosylation site, and over half was glycosylated when the natural glycosylation site was replaced by one in the C-terminal domain. A mutant MRAP with potential glycosylation sites on both sides of the membrane was singly but not doubly glycosylated, suggesting that MRAP is not monotopic. Coimmunoprecipitation of differentially tagged MRAPs established that MRAP is a dimer. By selectively immunoprecipitating cell surface MRAP in one or the other orientation, we showed that MRAP homodimers are antiparallel and form a stable complex with MC2 receptor. In the absence of MRAP, MC2 receptor was trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum, but with MRAP, the MC2 receptor was glycosylated and localized on the plasma membrane, where it signaled in response to ACTH. MRAP acted specifically, because it did not increase surface expression of other melanocortin, beta2-adrenergic, or TSH-releasing hormone receptors. MRAP is the first eukaryotic membrane protein identified with an antiparallel homodimeric structure."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,The tumor suppressor Fhit acts as a repressor of beta-catenin transcriptional activity.,"The Fra3B locus on chromosome 3p14.2 targeting the fragile histidine triad (Fhit) gene represents one of the most common fragile sites of the human genome and is associated with early preneoplastic and malignant disorders in multiple human tumors. Fhit was classified as a tumor suppressor; however, the molecular mechanisms of its function are not well established. Here, we report that Fhit associates with the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1/T cell factor/beta-catenin complex by directly binding to beta-catenin, a major player in the canonical Wnt pathway that is deregulated in numerous forms of human cancer. In binding to the beta-catenin C-terminal domain, Fhit represses transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1, axin2, MMP-14, and survivin. Knockdown of Fhit reversed this effect, whereas this reversal was not detectable when beta-catenin was knocked down simultaneously. The Fhit enzymatic activity as a diadenosine-polyphosphate hydrolase is not required for the down-regulation of beta-catenin-mediated transcription as examined with an enzymatic inactive Fhit-H96N protein. ChIPs revealed recruitment of Fhit/beta-catenin complexes to target gene promoters. In soft agar assays Fhit and beta-catenin are involved in regulation of anchorage-independent growth. These observations assign to the tumor suppressor Fhit an unexpected role in the regulation of beta-catenin-mediated gene transcription."
19633658,0,Structure,101087697,2007,Transformation efficiency of RasQ61 mutants linked to structural features of the switch regions in the presence of Raf.,"Transformation efficiencies of Ras mutants at residue 61 range over three orders of magnitude, but the in vitro GTPase activity decreases 10-fold for all mutants. We show that Raf impairs the GTPase activity of RasQ61L, suggesting that the Ras/Raf complex differentially modulates transformation. Our crystal structures show that, in transforming mutants, switch II takes part in a network of hydrophobic interactions burying the nucleotide and precatalytic water molecule. Our results suggest that Y32 and a water molecule bridging it to the gamma-phosphate in the wild-type structure play a role in GTP hydrolysis in lieu of the Arg finger in the absence of GAP. The bridging water molecule is absent in the transforming mutants, contributing to the burying of the nucleotide. We propose a mechanism for intrinsic hydrolysis in Raf-bound Ras and elucidate structural features in the Q61 mutants that correlate with their potency to transform cells."
19633711,0,Structure,101087697,2007,The NMDA receptor NR1 C1 region bound to calmodulin: structural insights into functional differences between homologous domains.,"Calmodulin (CaM) regulates tetrameric N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) by binding tightly to the C0 and C1 regions of its NR1 subunit. A crystal structure (2HQW; 1.96 A) of calcium-saturated CaM bound to NR1C1 (peptide spanning 875-898) showed that NR1 S890, whose phosphorylation regulates membrane localization, was solvent protected, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif was solvent exposed. NR1 F880 filled the CaM C-domain pocket, whereas T886 was closest to the N-domain pocket. This 1-7 pattern was most similar to that in the CaM-MARCKS complex. Comparison of CaM-ligand wrap-around conformations identified a core tetrad of CaM C-domain residues (FLMM(C)) that contacted all ligands consistently. An identical tetrad of N-domain residues (FLMM(N)) made variable sets of contacts with ligands. This CaM-NR1C1 structure provides a foundation for designing mutants to test the role of CaM in NR1 trafficking as well as insights into how the homologous CaM domains have different roles in molecular recognition."

We report the crystal structures of the TK homotetramer from Thermotoga maritima in four different states: its apo-form, a binary complex with thymidine, as well as the ternary structures with the two substrates (thymidine/AppNHp) and the reaction products (TMP/ADP). In combination with fluorescence spectroscopy and mutagenesis experiments, our results demonstrate that ATP binding is linked to a substantial reorganization of the enzyme quaternary structure, leading to a transition from a closed, inactive conformation to an open, catalytic state. We hypothesize that these structural changes are relevant to enzyme function in situ as part of the catalytic cycle and serve an important role in regulating enzyme activity by amplifying the effects of feedback inhibitor binding."
19635902,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,Interaction between SGT1 and cytosolic/nuclear HSC70 chaperones regulates Arabidopsis immune responses.,"The conserved eukaryotic protein SGT1 (for Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) has characteristics of an HSP90 (for heat shock protein 90 kD) cochaperone and in plants regulates hormone responses and Resistance gene-triggered immunity. We affinity-purified SGT1-interacting proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf extracts and identified by mass spectrometry cytosolic heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) chaperones as the major stable SGT1 interactors. Arabidopsis SGT1a and SGT1b proteins associate with HSC70 in vivo and distribute with HSC70 in the cytosol and nucleus. An intact C-terminal SGT1-specific (SGS) domain that is required for all known SGT1b functions in immunity and development is needed for HSC70 interaction and for the nuclear accumulation of SGT1b. Interaction assays of transiently expressed proteins or their domains in Nicotiana benthamiana point to a role of SGT1 as a HSC70 cofactor. Expression of two HSC70 isoforms is upregulated by pathogen challenge, and while loss of function of individual cytosolic HSC70 genes has no defense phenotype, HSC70-1 overexpression disables resistance to virulent and avirulent pathogens. Moreover, mutations in SGT1b lead to a similar degree of heat shock tolerance as deregulation of HSC70-1. We conclude that an HSC70-SGT1 chaperone complex is important for multiple plant environmental responses and that the evolutionarily conserved SGS domain of SGT1 is a key determinant of the HSC70-SGT1 association."
19636411,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Ku recruits XLF to DNA double-strand breaks.,"XRCC4-like factor (XLF)--also known as Cernunnos--has recently been shown to be involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is the main pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. XLF is likely to enhance NHEJ by stimulating XRCC4-ligase IV-mediated joining of DSBs. Here, we report mechanistic details of XLF recruitment to DSBs. Live cell imaging combined with laser micro-irradiation showed that XLF is an early responder to DSBs and that Ku is essential for XLF recruitment to DSBs. Biochemical analysis showed that Ku-XLF interaction occurs on DNA and that Ku stimulates XLF binding to DNA. Unexpectedly, XRCC4 is dispensable for XLF recruitment to DSBs, although photobleaching analysis showed that XRCC4 stabilizes the binding of XLF to DSBs. Our observations showed the direct involvement of XLF in the dynamic assembly of the NHEJ machinery and provide mechanistic insights into DSB recognition."
19637916,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Molecular basis of the C-terminal tail-to-tail assembly of the sarcomeric filament protein myomesin.,"Sarcomeric filament proteins display extraordinary properties in terms of protein length and mechanical elasticity, requiring specific anchoring and assembly mechanisms. To establish the molecular basis of terminal filament assembly, we have selected the sarcomeric M-band protein myomesin as a prototypic filament model. The crystal structure of the myomesin C-terminus, comprising a tandem array of two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains My12 and My13, reveals a dimeric end-to-end filament of 14.3 nm length. Although the two domains share the same fold, an unexpected rearrangement of one beta-strand reveals how they are evolved into unrelated functions, terminal filament assembly (My13) and filament propagation (My12). The two domains are connected by a six-turn alpha-helix, of which two turns are void of any interactions with other protein parts. Thus, the overall structure of the assembled myomesin C-terminus resembles a three-body beads-on-the-string model with potentially elastic properties. We predict that the found My12-helix-My13 domain topology may provide a structural template for the filament architecture of the entire C-terminal Ig domain array My9-My13 of myomesin."
19637932,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,14-3-3 proteins recognize a histone code at histone H3 and are required for transcriptional activation.,"Interphase phosphorylation of S10 at histone H3 is linked to transcriptional activation of a specific subset of mammalian genes like HDAC1. Recently, 14-3-3 proteins have been described as detectors for this phosphorylated histone H3 form. Here, we report that 14-3-3 binding is modulated by combinatorial modifications of histone H3. S10 phosphorylation is necessary for an interaction, but additional H3K9 or H3K14 acetylation increases the affinity of 14-3-3 for histone H3. Histone H3 phosphoacetylation occurs concomitant with K9 methylation in vivo, suggesting that histone phosphorylation and acetylation can synergize to overcome repressive histone methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins to the HDAC1 gene in an H3S10ph-dependent manner. Recruitment of 14-3-3 to the promoter is enhanced by additional histone H3 acetylation and correlates with dissociation of the repressive binding module HP1gamma. Finally, siRNA-mediated loss of 14-3-3 proteins abolishes the transcriptional activation of HDAC1. Together our data indicate that 14-3-3 proteins are crucial mediators of histone phosphoacetylation signals."
19638241,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,The 44-kDa Pim-1 kinase phosphorylates BCRP/ABCG2 and thereby promotes its multimerization and drug-resistant activity in human prostate cancer cells.,"We previously showed that the 44-kDa serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 (Pim-1L) can protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs (Xie, Y., Xu, K., Dai, B., Guo, Z., Jiang, T., Chen, H., and Qiu, Y. (2006) Oncogene 25, 70-78). To further explore the mechanisms of Pim-1L-mediated resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in prostate cancer cells, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify cellular proteins that were associated with Pim-1L, and we found the ABC transporter BCRP/ABCG2 as one of the potential interacting partners of Pim-1L. We also showed that the expression level of Pim-1L and BCRP was up-regulated in mitoxantrone and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Pim-1L was co-localized with BCRP on the plasma membrane and induced phosphorylation of BCRP at threonine 362. Knocking-down Pim-1L expression in the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells abolished multimer formation of endogenous BCRP and resensitized the resistant cells to chemotherapeutic drugs suggesting that BCRP phosphorylation induced by Pim-1L was essential for its functionality. This is further corroborated by our finding that the plasma membrane localization and drug-resistant activity of BCRP were compromised by T362A mutation. Our data suggest that Pim-1L may protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis, at least in part, through regulation of transmembrane drug efflux pump. These findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach by disrupting Pim-1 signaling to reverse BCRP-mediated multidrug resistance."
19638343,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Monomeric myosin V uses two binding regions for the assembly of stable translocation complexes.,"Myosin-motors are conserved from yeast to human and transport a great variety of cargoes. Most plus-end directed myosins, which constitute the vast majority of all myosin motors, form stable dimers and interact constitutively with their cargo complexes. To date, little is known about regulatory mechanisms for cargo-complex assembly. In this study, we show that the type V myosin Myo4p binds to its cargo via two distinct binding regions, the C-terminal tail and a coiled-coil domain-containing fragment. Furthermore, we find that Myo4p is strictly monomeric at physiologic concentrations. Because type V myosins are thought to require dimerization for processive movement, a mechanism must be in place to ensure that oligomeric Myo4p is incorporated into cargo-translocation complexes. Indeed, we find that artificial dimerization of the Myo4p C-terminal tail promotes stabilization of myosin-cargo complexes, suggesting that full-length Myo4p dimerizes in the cocomplex as well. We also combined the Myo4p C-terminal tail with the coiled-coil region, lever arm, and motor domain from a different myosin to form constitutively dimeric motor proteins. This heterologous motor successfully translocates its cargo in vivo, suggesting that wild-type Myo4p may also function as a dimer during cargo-complex transport."
19638405,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Control of mitotic exit by PP2A regulation of Cdc25C and Cdk1.,"Inactivation of maturation-promoting factor [(MPF) Cdk1/Cyclin B] is a key event in the exit from mitosis. Although degradation of Cyclin B is important for MPF inactivation, recent studies indicate that Cdk1 phosphorylation and inactivation occur before Cyclin B degradation and, therefore, also may be important steps in the exit from mitosis. Cdk1 activity is controlled by the Cdc25C phosphatase, which is turned on at the G(2)/M transition to catalyze Cdk1 activation. PP2A:B56delta is a negative regulator of Cdc25C during interphase. We show here that PP2A:B56delta also regulates Cdc25C at mitosis. Failure of PP2A:B56delta to dephosphorylate Cdc25C at mitosis results in prolonged hyperphosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C, causing persistent dephosphorylation and, hence, activation of Cdk1. This constitutive activation of Cdc25C and Cdk1 leads to a delayed exit from mitosis. Consistent with Cdk1 as a major biological target of B56delta, stable knockdown and germ-line mouse KO of B56delta leads to compensatory transcriptional up-regulation of Wee1 kinase to oppose the Cdc25C activity and permit cell survival. These observations place PP2A:B56delta as a key upstream regulator of Cdk1 activity upon exit from mitosis."
19638411,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Recruitment of conjugative DNA transfer substrate to Agrobacterium type IV secretion apparatus.,"Bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) belongs to a growing class of evolutionarily conserved transporters that translocate DNA and proteins into a wide variety of organisms including bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Archetypal is the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/D4 T4SS that transfers oncogenic T-DNA to various eukaryotic cells, which is transferred as a nucleoprotein T-complex with VirD2 as the pilot protein. As a derivative of plasmid conjugation systems, the VirB/D4 T4SS can also transfer certain mobilizable plasmids and bacterial proteins like VirE2 and VirF, although it is unknown how the membrane-bound T4SS recruits different transfer substrates. Here, we show that a cytoplasmic VirD2-binding protein (VBP) is involved in the recruitment of the T-complex to the energizing components of the T4SS, including VirD4, VirB4, and VirB11. VBP is also important for the recruitment of a conjugative plasmid to a different transfer system independent of VirB/D4. These data indicate that VBP functions as a previously unrecognized recruiting protein that helps couple nucleoprotein substrates to the appropriate transport sites for conjugative DNA transfers. VBP has three functionally redundant homologs, and similar homologs can be found in different bacterial genomes, suggesting a previously uncharacterized class of proteins involved in conjugative DNA transfers."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,"Structure, inhibitor, and regulatory mechanism of Lyp, a lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase implicated in autoimmune diseases.","The lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase (Lyp) has generated enormous interest because a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene (PTPN22) encoding Lyp produces a gain-of-function mutant phosphatase that is associated with several autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, Lyp represents a potential target for a broad spectrum of autoimmune disorders. Unfortunately, no Lyp inhibitor has been reported. In addition, little is known about the structure and biochemical mechanism that directly regulates Lyp function. Here, we report the identification of a bidentate salicylic acid-based Lyp inhibitor I-C11 with excellent cellular efficacy. Structural and mutational analyses indicate that the inhibitor binds both the active site and a nearby peripheral site unique to Lyp, thereby furnishing a solid foundation upon which inhibitors with therapeutic potency and selectivity can be developed. Moreover, a comparison of the apo- and inhibitor-bound Lyp structures reveals that the Lyp-specific region S(35)TKYKADK(42), which harbors a PKC phosphorylation site, could adopt either a loop or helical conformation. We show that Lyp is phosphorylated exclusively at Ser-35 by PKC both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that the status of Ser-35 phosphorylation may dictate the conformational state of the insert region and thus Lyp substrate recognition. We demonstrate that Ser-35 phosphorylation impairs Lyp's ability to inactivate the Src family kinases and down-regulate T cell receptor signaling. Our data establish a mechanism by which PKC could attenuate the cellular function of Lyp, thereby augmenting T cell activation."

Chem.,2985121R,2008,Aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 affects fatty acid synthesis by regulating the stability of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha in breast cancer cells.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 (AKR1B10), a novel protein overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, may facilitate cancer cell growth by detoxifying intracellular reactive carbonyls. This study presents a novel function of AKR1B10 in tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (RAO-3), regulating fatty acid synthesis. In RAO-3 cells, Sephacryl-S 300 gel filtration and DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography demonstrated that AKR1B10 exists in two distinct forms, monomers (approximately 40 kDa) bound to DEAE-Sepharose column and protein complexes (approximately 300 kDa) remaining in flow-through. Co-immunoprecipitation with AKR1B10 antibody and protein mass spectrometry analysis identified that AKR1B10 associates with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACCA), a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. This association between AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation with ACCA antibody and pulldown assays with recombinant AKR1B10 protein. Intracellular fluorescent studies showed that AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm of RAO-3 cells. More interestingly, small interfering RNA-mediated AKR1B10 knock down increased ACCA degradation through ubiquitination-proteasome pathway and resulted in &gt;50% decrease of fatty acid synthesis in RAO-3 cells. These data suggest that AKR1B10 is a novel regulator of the biosynthesis of fatty acid, an essential component of the cell membrane, in breast cancer cells."
19638589,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,PRR3 Is a vascular regulator of TOC1 stability in the Arabidopsis circadian clock.,"The pseudoresponse regulators (PRRs) participate in the progression of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis thaliana. The founding member of the family, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), is an essential component of the transcriptional network that constitutes the core mechanism of the circadian oscillator. Recent data suggest a role in circadian regulation for all five members of the PRR family; however, the molecular function of TOC1 or any other PRRs remains unknown. In this work, we present evidence for the involvement of PRR3 in the regulation of TOC1 protein stability. PRR3 was temporally coexpressed with TOC1 under different photoperiods, yet its tissue expression was only partially overlapping with that of TOC1, as PRR3 appeared restricted to the vasculature. Decreased expression of PRR3 resulted in reduced levels of TOC1 protein, while overexpression of PRR3 caused an increase in the levels of TOC1, all without affecting the amount of TOC1 transcript. PRR3 was able to bind to TOC1 in yeast and in plants and to perturb TOC1 interaction with ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which targets TOC1 for proteasome-dependent degradation. Together, our results indicate that PRR3 might function to modulate TOC1 stability by hindering ZTL-dependent TOC1 degradation, suggesting the existence of local regulators of clock activity and adding to the growing importance of posttranslational regulation in the design of circadian timing mechanisms in plants."
19638971,0,Stem Cells,9304532,2008,Connexin expression and functional analysis of gap junctional communication in mouse embryonic stem cells.,"Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) has been suggested to be necessary for cellular proliferation and differentiation. We wanted to investigate the function of GJIC in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using pharmacological inhibitors or a genetic approach to inhibit the expression of connexins, that is, the subunit proteins of gap junction channels. For this purpose, we have analyzed all known connexin genes in mouse ES cells but found only three of them, Cx31, Cx43, and Cx45, to be expressed as proteins. We have demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that Cx31 and Cx43, as well as Cx43 and Cx45, probably form heteromeric gap junction channels, whereas Cx31 and Cx45 do not. The pharmacological inhibitors reduced GJIC between ES cells to approximately 3% and initiated apoptosis, suggesting an antiapoptotic effect of GJIC. In contrast to these results, reduction of GJIC to approximately 5% by decreased expression of Cx31 or Cx45 via RNA interference in homozygous Cx43-deficient ES cells did not lead to apoptosis. Additional studies suggested that apoptotic death of ES cells and adult stem cells reported in the literature is likely due to a cytotoxic side effect of the inhibitors and not due to a decrease of GJIC. Using the connexin expression pattern in mouse ES cells, as determined in this study, multiple connexin-deficient ES cells can now be genetically engineered in which the level of GJIC is further decreased, to clarify whether the differentiation of ES cells is qualitatively or quantitatively compromised."
19638981,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,The inhibition of polo kinase by matrimony maintains G2 arrest in the meiotic cell cycle.,"Many meiotic systems in female animals include a lengthy arrest in G2 that separates the end of pachytene from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB). However, the mechanisms by which a meiotic cell can arrest for long periods of time (decades in human females) have remained a mystery. The Drosophila Matrimony (Mtrm) protein is expressed from the end of pachytene until the completion of meiosis I. Loss-of-function mtrm mutants result in precocious NEB. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Mtrm physically interacts with Polo kinase (Polo) in vivo, and multidimensional protein identification technology mass spectrometry analysis reveals that Mtrm binds to Polo with an approximate stoichiometry of 1:1. Mutation of a Polo-Box Domain (PBD) binding site in Mtrm ablates the function of Mtrm and the physical interaction of Mtrm with Polo. The meiotic defects observed in mtrm/+ heterozygotes are fully suppressed by reducing the dose of polo+, demonstrating that Mtrm acts as an inhibitor of Polo. Mtrm acts as a negative regulator of Polo during the later stages of G2 arrest. Indeed, both the repression of Polo expression until stage 11 and the inactivation of newly synthesized Polo by Mtrm until stage 13 play critical roles in maintaining and properly terminating G2 arrest. Our data suggest a model in which the eventual activation of Cdc25 by an excess of Polo at stage 13 triggers NEB and entry into prometaphase."

Mutations in WNK1-4 cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II-a form of hypertension. WNKs have been linked to the STE20 kinases and ion carriers, but the underlying molecular mechanisms by which WNKs regulate cellular processes in whole animals are unknown. The Caenorhabditis elegans WNK-like kinase WNK-1 interacts with and phosphorylates germinal centre kinase (GCK)-3--a STE20-like kinase--which is known to inactivate CLH-3, a CIC chloride channel. The wnk-1 or gck-3 deletion mutation causes an Exc phenotype, a defect in the tubular extension of excretory canals. Expression of the activated form of GCK-3 or the clh-3 deletion mutation can partly suppress wnk-1 or gck-3 defects, respectively. These results indicate that WNK-1 controls the tubular formation of excretory canals by activating GCK-3, resulting in downregulation of CIC channel activity."

Our studies indicated that HPV activates capases-3, -7, and -9 upon differentiation, whereas minimal activation was observed in differentiating normal keratinocytes. Activation occurred in the absence of significant levels of apoptosis, suggesting a potential role for caspases in the viral life cycle. In support of this, the addition of caspase inhibitors significantly impaired differentiation-dependent viral genome amplification. A conserved caspase cleavage motif was identified in the replication protein E1 ((46)DxxD(49)) that was targeted in vitro by both recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-7. Mutation of this site inhibited amplification of viral genomes, indicating that caspase cleavage is necessary for the productive viral life cycle. Our study demonstrates that HPV activates caspases upon differentiation to facilitate productive viral replication and represents a way by which HPV controls viral gene function in differentiating cells."

Using a human mammary MCF7-derived AREc32 reporter cell line, we now report that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and other retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) agonists, markedly reduces the ability of Nrf2 to mediate induction of ARE-driven genes by cancer chemopreventive agents including the metabolite of butylated hydroxyanisole, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). The basal and tBHQ-inducible expression of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 genes, which are regulated by Nrf2, was also repressed by ATRA in AREc32 cells. Antagonists of RARalpha augmented induction of ARE-driven gene expression by tBHQ, as did knockdown of RARalpha by using RNAi. The expression of the ARE-gene battery was increased in the small intestine of mice fed on a vitamin A-deficient diet, and this increase was repressed by administration of ATRA. By contrast, in the small intestine of Nrf2 null mice, the expression of ARE-driven genes was not affected by vitamin A status. In MCF7 cells, ATRA did not block the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 but reduced the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE enhancer as a consequence of forming a complex with RARalpha. These data suggest that cross-talk between Nrf2 and RARalpha could markedly influence the sensitivity of cells to electrophiles and oxidative stressors and, as a consequence, to carcinogenesis."

Peptidyl growth factors enhance Ca2+-evoked release, an effect that may underlie important adaptive responses such as the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by growth factors. Here, we show that activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays an essential role in nerve growth factor (NGF) enhancement of Ca2+-evoked release in PC12 neuroendocrine cells. Moreover, JNK associated with phosphorylated synaptotagmin-4 (Syt 4), a key mediator of NGF enhancement of Ca2+-evoked release in this system. NGF treatment led to phosphorylation of endogenous Syt 4 at Ser135 and translocation of Syt 4 from immature to mature secretory vesicles in a JNK-dependent manner. Furthermore, mutation of Ser135 abrogated enhancement of Ca2+-evoked release by Syt 4. These results provide a molecular basis for the effect of growth factors on Ca2+-mediated secretion."
19641032,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2008,Structure and functional analysis of the IGF-II/IGF2R interaction.,"Embryonic development and normal growth require exquisite control of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In mammals the extracellular region of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor has gained an IGF-II-binding function and is termed type II IGF receptor (IGF2R). IGF2R sequesters IGF-II; imbalances occur in cancers and IGF2R is implicated in tumour suppression. We report crystal structures of IGF2R domains 11-12, 11-12-13-14 and domains 11-12-13/IGF-II complex. A distinctive juxtaposition of these domains provides the IGF-II-binding unit, with domain 11 directly interacting with IGF-II and domain 13 modulating binding site flexibility. Our complex shows that Phe19 and Leu53 of IGF-II lock into a hydrophobic pocket unique to domain 11 of mammalian IGF2Rs. Mutagenesis analyses confirm this IGF-II 'binding-hotspot', revealing that IGF-binding proteins and IGF2R have converged on the same high-affinity site."

Neural recognition molecule Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1) has been shown to regulate oriented growth of apical dendrites in the mouse caudal cortex. Here we show that CHL1 directly associates with NB-3, a member of the F3/contactin family of neural recognition molecules, and enhances its cell surface expression. Similar to CHL1, NB-3 exhibits high-caudal to low-rostral expression in the deep layer neurons of the neocortex. NB-3-deficient mice show abnormal apical dendrite projections of deep layer pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex. Both CHL1 and NB-3 interact with protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) and regulate its activity. Moreover, deep layer pyramidal neurons of PTPalpha-deficient mice develop misoriented, even inverted, apical dendrites. We propose a signaling complex in which PTPalpha mediates CHL1 and NB-3-regulated apical dendrite projection in the developing caudal cortex."

We previously showed that the membrane-cytoskeleton linker ezrin plays a major role in HGF-induced morphogenic effects. Here we identified a novel partner of phosphorylated ezrin, the Fes kinase, that acts downstream of ezrin in HGF-mediated cell scattering. We found that Fes interacts directly, through its SH2 domain, with ezrin phosphorylated at tyrosine 477. We show that in epithelial cells, activated Fes localizes either to focal adhesions or cell-cell contacts depending on cell confluency. The recruitment and the activation of Fes to the cell-cell contacts in confluent cells depend on its interaction with ezrin. When this interaction is impaired, Fes remains in focal adhesions and as a consequence the cells show defective spreading and scattering in response to HGF stimulation. Altogether, these results provide a novel mechanism whereby ezrin/Fes interaction at cell-cell contacts plays an essential role in HGF-induced cell scattering and implicates Fes in the cross-talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion."
19641493,0,Cell,413066,2007,Integrating patterning signals: Wnt/GSK3 regulates the duration of the BMP/Smad1 signal.,"BMP receptors determine the intensity of BMP signals via Smad1 C-terminal phosphorylations. Here we show that a finely controlled cell biological pathway terminates this activity. The duration of the activated pSmad1(Cter) signal was regulated by sequential Smad1 linker region phosphorylations at conserved MAPK and GSK3 sites required for its polyubiquitinylation and transport to the centrosome. Proteasomal degradation of activated Smad1 and total polyubiquitinated proteins took place in the centrosome. Inhibitors of the Erk, p38, and JNK MAPKs, as well as GSK3 inhibitors, prolonged the duration of a pulse of BMP7. Wnt signaling decreased pSmad1(GSK3) antigen levels and redistributed it from the centrosome to cytoplasmic LRP6 signalosomes. In Xenopus embryos, it was found that Wnts induce epidermis and that this required an active BMP-Smad pathway. Epistatic experiments suggested that the dorsoventral (BMP) and anteroposterior (Wnt/GSK3) patterning gradients are integrated at the level of Smad1 phosphorylations during embryonic pattern formation."

The vault shell self-assembles from 96 copies of major vault protein and encapsulates two other proteins and a small RNA. We crystallized rat liver vaults and several recombinant vaults, all among the largest non-icosahedral particles to have been crystallized. The best crystals thus far were formed from empty vaults built from a cysteine-tag construct of major vault protein (termed cpMVP vaults), diffracting to about 9-A resolution. The asymmetric unit contains a half vault of molecular mass 4.65 MDa. X-ray phasing was initiated by molecular replacement, using density from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Phases were improved by density modification, including concentric 24- and 48-fold rotational symmetry averaging. From this, the continuous cryo-EM electron density separated into domain-like blocks. A draft atomic model of cpMVP was fit to this improved density from 15 domain models. Three domains were adapted from a nuclear magnetic resonance substructure. Nine domain models originated in ab initio tertiary structure prediction. Three C-terminal domains were built by fitting poly-alanine to the electron density. Locations of loops in this model provide sites to test vault functions and to exploit vaults as nanocapsules."

The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (DeltaGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of DeltaGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that DeltaGBD-mDia2-induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Epidermal growth factor receptor juxtamembrane region regulates allosteric tyrosine kinase activation.,"Structural studies of the extracellular and tyrosine kinase domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB-1) provide considerable insight into facets of the receptor activation mechanism, but the contributions of other regions of ErbB-1 have not been ascertained. This study demonstrates that the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region plays a vital role in the kinase activation mechanism. In the experiments described herein, the entire ErbB-1 intracellular domain (ICD) has been expressed in mammalian cells to explore the significance of the JM region in kinase activity. Deletion of the JM region (DeltaJM) results in a severe loss of ICD tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that this region is required for maximal activity of the tyrosine kinase domain. Coexpression of DeltaJM and dimerization-deficient kinase domain ICD mutants revealed that the JM region is indispensable for allosteric kinase activation and productive monomer interactions within a dimer. Studies with the intact receptor confirmed the role of the JM region in kinase activation. Within the JM region, Thr-654 is a known protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site that modulates kinase activity in the context of the intact ErbB-1 receptor; yet, the mechanism is not known. Whereas a T654A mutation promotes increased ICD tyrosine phosphorylation, the phosphomimetic T654D mutant generates a 50% reduction in ICD tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar to the DeltaJM mutants, the T654D mutant ICD failed to interact with a wild-type monomer. This study reveals an integral role for the intracellular JM region of ErbB-1 in allosteric kinase activation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,"CERK1, a LysM receptor kinase, is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis.","Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) for the detection of various potential pathogens in innate immune systems of both plants and animals. We recently showed that chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP), plasma membrane glycoprotein with LysM motifs, functions as a cell surface receptor for chitin elicitor in rice. The predicted structure of CEBiP does not contain any intracellular domains, suggesting that an additional component(s) is required for signaling through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Here, we identified a receptor-like kinase, designated CERK1, which is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis. The KO mutants for CERK1 completely lost the ability to respond to the chitin elicitor, including MAPK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and gene expression. Disease resistance of the KO mutant against an incompatible fungus, Alternaria brassicicola, was partly impaired. Complementation with the WT CERK1 gene showed cerk1 mutations were responsible for the mutant phenotypes. CERK1 is a plasma membrane protein containing three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain with autophosphorylation/myelin basic protein kinase activity, suggesting that CERK1 plays a critical role in fungal MAMP perception in plants."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Silencing of OB-RGRP in mouse hypothalamic arcuate nucleus increases leptin receptor signaling and prevents diet-induced obesity.,"Obesity is a major public health problem and is often associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Leptin is the crucial adipostatic hormone that controls food intake and body weight through the activation of specific leptin receptors (OB-R) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). However, in most obese patients, high circulating levels of leptin fail to bring about weight loss. The prevention of this &quot;leptin resistance&quot; is a major goal for obesity research. We report here a successful prevention of diet-induced obesity (DIO) by silencing a negative regulator of OB-R function, the OB-R gene-related protein (OB-RGRP), whose transcript is genetically linked to the OB-R transcript. We provide in vitro evidence that OB-RGRP controls OB-R function by negatively regulating its cell surface expression. In the DIO mouse model, obesity was prevented by silencing OB-RGRP through stereotactic injection of a lentiviral vector encoding a shRNA directed against OB-RGRP in the ARC. This work demonstrates that OB-RGRP is a potential target for obesity treatment. Indeed, regulators of the receptor could be more appropriate targets than the receptor itself. This finding could serve as the basis for an approach to identifying potential new therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases, including obesity."

Therefore, protein-protein interaction inhibition (2P2I) is endowed with great therapeutic potential despite the initial belief that 2P2I was refractory to small-molecule intervention. Improved knowledge of complex molecular binding surfaces has recently stimulated renewed interest for 2P2I, especially after identification of &quot;hot spots&quot; and first inhibitory compounds. However, the combination of target complexity and lack of starting compound has thwarted experimental results and created intellectual barriers. Here we combined virtual and experimental screening when no previously known inhibitors can be used as starting point in a structure-based research program that targets an SH3 binding surface of the HIV type I Nef protein. High-throughput docking and application of a pharmacophoric filter on one hand and search for analogy on the other hand identified drug-like compounds that were further confirmed to bind Nef in the micromolar range (isothermal titration calorimetry), to target the Nef SH3 binding surface (NMR experiments), and to efficiently compete for Nef-SH3 interactions (cell-based assay, GST pull-down). Initial identification of these compounds by virtual screening was validated by screening of the very same library of compounds in the cell-based assay, demonstrating that a significant enrichment factor was attained by the in silico screening. To our knowledge, our results identify the first set of drug-like compounds that functionally target the HIV-1 Nef SH3 binding surface and provide the basis for a powerful discovery process that should help to speed up 2P2I strategies and open avenues for new class of antiviral molecules."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Assembly and structural properties of glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand: Implications for function.,"Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand (GITRL), a recently identified member of the TNF family, binds to its receptor GITR on both effector and regulatory T cells and generates positive costimulatory signals implicated in a wide range of T cell functions. Structural analysis reveals that the human GITRL (hGITRL) ectodomain self-assembles into an atypical expanded homotrimer with sparse monomer-monomer interfaces. Consistent with the small intersubunit interfaces, hGITRL exhibits a relatively weak tendency to trimerize in solution and displays a monomer-trimer equilibrium not reported for other TNF family members. This unique assembly behavior has direct implications for hGITRL-GITR signaling, because enforced trimerization of soluble hGITRL ectodomain results in an approximately 100-fold increase in its receptor binding affinity and also in enhanced costimulatory activity. The apparent reduction in affinity that is the consequence of this dynamic equilibrium may represent a mechanism to realize the biologically optimal level of signaling through the hGITRL-GITR pathway, as opposed to the maximal achievable level."

Small molecule obatoclax (GX15-070), which is predicted to occupy a hydrophobic pocket within the BH3 binding groove of BCL-2, antagonizes these members and induces apoptosis, dependent on BAX and BAK. Reconstitution in yeast confirmed that obatoclax acts on the pathway and overcomes BCL-2-, BCL-XL-, BCL-w-, and MCL-1-mediated resistance to BAX or BAK. The compound potently interfered with the direct interaction between MCL-1 and BAK in intact mitochondrial outer membrane and inhibited the association between MCL-1 and BAK in intact cells. MCL-1 has been shown to confer resistance to the BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-w-selective antagonist ABT-737 and to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In both cases, this resistance was overcome by obatoclax. These findings support a rational clinical development opportunity for the compound in cancer indications or treatments where MCL-1 contributes to resistance to cell killing."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Structure of the Nitrosomonas europaea Rh protein.,"Amt/MEP/Rh proteins are a family of integral membrane proteins implicated in the transport of NH3, CH(2)NH2, and CO2. Whereas Amt/MEP proteins are agreed to transport ammonia (NH3/NH4+), the primary substrate for Rh proteins has been controversial. Initial studies suggested that Rh proteins also transport ammonia, but more recent evidence suggests that they transport CO2. Here we report the first structure of an Rh family member, the Rh protein from the chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea. This Rh protein exhibits a number of similarities to its Amt cousins, including a trimeric oligomeric state, a central pore with an unusual twin-His site in the middle, and a Phe residue that blocks the channel for small-molecule transport. However, there are some significant differences, the most notable being the presence of an additional cytoplasmic C-terminal alpha-helix, an increased number of internal proline residues along the transmembrane helices, and a specific set of residues that appear to link the C-terminal helix to Phe blockage. This latter linkage suggests a mechanism in which binding of a partner protein to the C terminus could regulate channel opening. Another difference is the absence of the extracellular pi-cation binding site conserved in Amt/Mep structures. Instead, CO2 pressurization experiments identify a CO2 binding site near the intracellular exit of the channel whose residues are highly conserved in all Rh proteins, except those belonging to the Rh30 subfamily. The implications of these findings on the functional role of the human Rh antigens are discussed."

We have investigated the importance of the nuclear positioning of a gene, its transcription and the consequent export of the nascent mRNA. We show that E(y)2 is a subunit of the SAGA/TFTC-type histone acetyl transferase complex in Drosophila and that E(y)2 concentrates at the nuclear periphery. We demonstrate an interaction between E(y)2 and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and show that SAGA/TFTC also contacts the NPC at the nuclear periphery. E(y)2 forms also a complex with X-linked male sterile 2 (Xmas-2) to regulate mRNA transport both in normal conditions and after heat shock. Importantly, E(y)2 and Xmas-2 knockdown decreases the contact between the heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) gene loci and the nuclear envelope before and after activation and interferes with transcription. Thus, E(y)2 and Xmas-2 together with SAGA/TFTC function in the anchoring of a subset of transcription sites to the NPCs to achieve efficient transcription and mRNA export."

Bioinformatics analyses suggested that PilZ domains bind c-di-GMP and allosterically modulate effector pathways. We have determined a 1.9 A crystal structure of c-di-GMP bound to VCA0042/PlzD, a PilZ domain-containing protein from Vibrio cholerae. Either this protein or another specific PilZ domain-containing protein is required for V. cholerae to efficiently infect mice. VCA0042/PlzD comprises a C-terminal PilZ domain plus an N-terminal domain with a similar beta-barrel fold. C-di-GMP contacts seven of the nine strongly conserved residues in the PilZ domain, including three in a seven-residue long N-terminal loop that undergoes a conformational switch as it wraps around c-di-GMP. This switch brings the PilZ domain into close apposition with the N-terminal domain, forming a new allosteric interaction surface that spans these domains and the c-di-GMP at their interface. The very small size of the N-terminal conformational switch is likely to explain the facile evolutionary diversification of the PilZ domain."
19643963,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,An acetylation/deacetylation cycle controls the export of sterols and steroids from S. cerevisiae.,"Sterol homeostasis in eukaryotic cells relies on the reciprocal interconversion of free sterols and steryl esters. Here we report the identification of a novel reversible sterol modification in yeast, the sterol acetylation/deacetylation cycle. Sterol acetylation requires the acetyltransferase ATF2, whereas deacetylation requires SAY1, a membrane-anchored deacetylase with a putative active site in the ER lumen. Lack of SAY1 results in the secretion of acetylated sterols into the culture medium, indicating that the substrate specificity of SAY1 determines whether acetylated sterols are secreted from the cells or whether they are deacetylated and retained. Consistent with this proposition, we find that acetylation and export of the steroid hormone precursor pregnenolone depends on its acetylation by ATF2, but is independent of SAY1-mediated deacetylation. Cells lacking Say1 or Atf2 are sensitive against the plant-derived allylbenzene eugenol and both Say1 and Atf2 affect pregnenolone toxicity, indicating that lipid acetylation acts as a detoxification pathway. The fact that homologues of SAY1 are present in the mammalian genome and functionally substitute for SAY1 in yeast indicates that part of this pathway has been evolutionarily conserved."

Here we show that the major eisosome component Pil1 in vivo is a target of the long-chain base (LCB, the biosynthetic precursors to sphingolipids)-signaling pathway mediated by the Pkh-kinases. Eisosomes disassemble if Pil1 is hyperphosphorylated (i) upon overexpression of Pkh-kinases, (ii) upon reducing LCB concentrations by inhibiting serine-palmitoyl transferase in lcb1-mutant cells or by poisoning the enzyme with myriocin, and (iii) upon mimicking hyperphosphorylation in pil1-mutant cells. Conversely, more Pil1 assembles into eisosomes if Pil1 is hypophosphorylated (i) upon reducing Pkh-kinase activity in pkh1 pkh2-mutant cells, (ii) upon activating Pkh-kinases by addition of LCBs, and (iii) upon mimicking hypophosphorylation in pil1-mutant cells. The resulting enlarged eisosomes show altered organization. Other data suggest that Pkh signaling and sphingolipids are important for endocytosis. Taken together with our previous results that link eisosomes to endocytosis, these observations suggest that Pkh-kinase signaling relayed to Pil1 may help regulate endocytic events to modulate the organization of the plasma membrane."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Chronic stimulation of Nod2 mediates tolerance to bacterial products.,"The Toll-like receptor (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod) families of proteins are critical for bacterial recognition, and, acutely, this frequently leads to proinflammatory responses. Polymorphisms in Nod2 (CARD 15) are associated with an increased likelihood of developing Crohn's disease. However, it is not yet clear how Nod2 dysfunctions lead to defects in human intestinal immune homeostasis. Studies to date have focused on functions after acute, rather than chronic, Nod2 stimulation. However, the intestine is an environment of chronic bacterial product exposure with tolerance to luminal flora. We therefore hypothesized that long-term Nod2 stimulation contributes to down-regulation of inflammatory responses from innate immune receptors. We found that pretreatment with muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a ligand for Nod2, significantly decreased production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-1beta upon Nod2, TLR4, and TLR2 restimulation in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages from a large cohort of individuals. Importantly, TNF-alpha-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines remained intact in these same cells. MDP-stimulated macrophages from Crohn's disease-relevant Leu1007insC Nod2 homozygote individuals were deficient in their ability to cross-tolerize to subsequent treatment with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. We show that acute Nod2 stimulation induced IRAK-1 activation, and that chronic MDP treatment down-regulated IRAK-1 activation upon Nod2 or TLR4 restimulation. In a subset of individuals, chronic Nod2 stimulation induced expression of the IRAK-1 inhibitory protein IRAK-M. Significantly, intestinal macrophages exhibit tolerance to MDP per production of inflammatory cytokines. These results illustrate a role for chronic stimulation of Nod2 in mediating tolerance to bacterial products."

The significance of Rh proteins derives from their presence in the human red blood cell membrane, where they constitute the second most important group of antigens used in transfusion medicine after the ABO group. Rh proteins are related to the ammonium transport (Amt) protein family and there is considerable evidence that, like Amt proteins, they function as ammonia channels. We have now solved the structure of a rare bacterial homologue (from Nitrosomonas europaea) of human Rh50 proteins at a resolution of 1.3 A. The protein is a trimer, and analysis of its subunit interface strongly argues that all Rh proteins are likely to be homotrimers and that the human erythrocyte proteins RhAG and RhCE/D are unlikely to form heterooligomers as previously proposed. When compared with structures of bacterial Amt proteins, NeRh50 shows several distinctive features of the substrate conduction pathway that support the concept that Rh proteins have much lower ammonium affinities than Amt proteins and might potentially function bidirectionally."

This latter conformer is believed to constitute the main component of the infectious TSE agent. In contrast to high-resolution data for the PrP(C) monomer, structures of the pathogenic PrP(Sc) or synthetic PrP(Sc)-like aggregates remain elusive. Here we have used site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy to probe the molecular architecture of the recombinant PrP amyloid, a misfolded form recently reported to induce transmissible disease in mice overexpressing an N-terminally truncated form of PrP(C). Our data show that, in contrast to earlier, largely theoretical models, the con formational conversion of PrP(C) involves major refolding of the C-terminal alpha-helical region. The core of the amyloid maps to C-terminal residues from approximately 160-220, and these residues form single-molecule layers that stack on top of one another with parallel, in-register alignment of beta-strands. This structural insight has important implications for understanding the molecular basis of prion propagation, as well as hereditary prion diseases, most of which are associated with point mutations in the region found to undergo a refolding to beta-structure."

RAG2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) near its C terminus (RAG2-PHD) that recognizes histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me) and influences V(D)J recombination. We report here crystal structures of RAG2-PHD alone and complexed with five modified H3 peptides. Two aspects of RAG2-PHD are unique. First, in the absence of the modified peptide, a peptide N-terminal to RAG2-PHD occupies the substrate-binding site, which may reflect an autoregulatory mechanism. Second, in contrast to other H3K4me3-binding PHD domains, RAG2-PHD substitutes a carboxylate that interacts with arginine 2 (R2) with a Tyr, resulting in binding to H3K4me3 that is enhanced rather than inhibited by dimethylation of R2. Five residues involved in histone H3 recognition were found mutated in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patients. Disruption of the RAG2-PHD structure appears to lead to the absence of T and B lymphocytes, whereas failure to bind H3K4me3 is linked to Omenn Syndrome. This work provides a molecular basis for chromatin-dependent gene recombination and presents a single protein domain that simultaneously recognizes two distinct histone modifications, revealing added complexity in the read-out of combinatorial histone modifications."

Although a variety of coactivators and corepressors of AF-2 have been identified, less is known of the mechanism of action of AF-1. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate a cDNA coding for a protein that binds specifically to the AF-1 region of human ERalpha. This cDNA codes for the transcription factor basal transcription factor 3 (BTF3). The specificity of the interaction between BTF3 and ERalpha has been confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Transient transfection experiments reveal that overexpression of BTF3 modulates the transcriptional response of reporter genes to ERalpha. BTF3 interacts with ERalpha that has been activated either by 17beta-estradiol (ligand-dependent activation) or by epidermal growth factor (ligand-independent activation). The effects of BTF3 on the reporter genes requires the presence of ERalpha containing an active AF-1 function. BTF3 may be a component of the mechanism by which the AF-1 function of ERalpha stimulates gene transcription."

We report here that nucleotide-excision repair (NER) may also play an important role in EBV lytic DNA replication. Firstly, the EBV BGLF4 kinase interacts with xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC), the critical DNA damage-recognition factor of NER, in yeast and in vitro, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Simultaneously, XPC was shown, by indirect immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, to interact and colocalize with BGLF4 in EBV-positive NA cells undergoing lytic viral replication. In addition, the efficiency of EBV DNA replication was reduced about 30-40 % by an XPC small interfering RNA. Expression of BGLF4 enhances cellular DNA-repair activity in p53-defective H1299/bcl2 cells in a host-cell reactivation assay. This enhancement was not observed in the XPC-mutant cell line XP4PA-SV unless complemented by ectopic XPC, suggesting that BGLF4 may stimulate DNA repair in an XPC-dependent manner. Overall, we suggest that the interaction of BGLF4 and XPC may be involved in DNA replication and repair and thereby enhance the efficiency of viral DNA replication."

We have now reanalyzed our x-ray data on EmrE. The corrected structures in complex with a transport substrate are highly similar to the electron microscopy structure.

Comparison of the nucleotide-free conformations of MsbA reveals a flexible hinge formed by extracellular loops 2 and 3. This hinge allows the nucleotide-binding domains to disassociate while the ATP-binding half sites remain facing each other. The binding of the nucleotide causes a packing rearrangement of the transmembrane helices and changes the accessibility of the transporter from cytoplasmic (inward) facing to extracellular (outward) facing. The inward and outward openings are mediated by two different sets of transmembrane helix interactions. Altogether, the conformational changes between these structures suggest that large ranges of motion may be required for substrate transport."
19646954,0,Cell,413066,2007,Structural basis for signal-sequence recognition by the translocase motor SecA as determined by NMR.,"Recognition of signal sequences by cognate receptors controls the entry of virtually all proteins to export pathways. Despite its importance, this process remains poorly understood. Here, we present the solution structure of a signal peptide bound to SecA, the 204 kDa ATPase motor of the Sec translocase. Upon encounter, the signal peptide forms an alpha-helix that inserts into a flexible and elongated groove in SecA. The mode of binding is bimodal, with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions mediating recognition. The same groove is used by SecA to recognize a diverse set of signal sequences. Impairment of the signal-peptide binding to SecA results in significant translocation defects. The C-terminal tail of SecA occludes the groove and inhibits signal-peptide binding, but autoinhibition is relieved by the SecB chaperone. Finally, it is shown that SecA interconverts between two conformations in solution, suggesting a simple mechanism for polypeptide translocation."
19647739,0,Cell,413066,2007,p31comet blocks Mad2 activation through structural mimicry.,"The status of spindle checkpoint signaling depends on the balance of two opposing dynamic processes that regulate the highly unusual two-state behavior of Mad2. In mitosis, a Mad1-Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic Mad2 to kinetochores through Mad2 dimerization and converts Mad2 to a conformer amenable to Cdc20 binding, thereby facilitating checkpoint activation. p31(comet) inactivates the checkpoint through binding to Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2, thereby preventing Mad2 activation and promoting the dissociation of the Mad2-Cdc20 complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Mad2-p31(comet) complex. The C-terminal region of Mad2 that undergoes rearrangement in different Mad2 conformers is a major structural determinant for p31(comet) binding, explaining the specificity of p31(comet) toward Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2. p31(comet) adopts a fold strikingly similar to that of Mad2 and binds at the dimerization interface of Mad2. Thus, p31(comet) exploits the two-state behavior of Mad2 to block its activation by acting as an &quot;anti-Mad2.&quot;"
19648269,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,SM-protein-controlled ER-associated degradation discriminates between different SNAREs.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a specialized activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that is involved in clearing the ER of aberrant proteins and regulating the levels of specific ER-resident proteins. Here we show that the yeast ER-SNARE Ufe1, a syntaxin (Qa-SNARE) involved in ER membrane fusion and retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, is prone to degradation by an ERAD-like mechanism. Notably, Ufe1 is protected against degradation through binding to Sly1, a known SNARE regulator of the Sec1-Munc18 (SM) protein family. This mechanism is specific for Ufe1, as the stability of another Sly1 partner, the Golgi Qa-SNARE Sed5, is not influenced by Sly1 interaction. Thus, our findings identify Sly1 as a discriminating regulator of SNARE levels and indicate that Sly1-controlled ERAD might regulate the balance between different Qa-SNARE proteins."
19649247,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Regulation of flowering time by the protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT10.,"In plants, histone H3 lysine methyltransferases are important in gene silencing and developmental regulation; however, the roles of histone H4 methylation in plant development remain unclear. Recent studies found a type II histone arginine methyltransferase, AtPRTM5, which is involved in promoting growth and flowering. Here, we purified a dimerized plant-specific histone H4 methyltransferase, plant histone arginine methyltransferase 10 (PHRMT10), from cauliflower. Arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine methyltransferase 10 (AtPRMT10)--the Arabidopsis homologue of PHRMT10--was shown to be a type I PRMT, which preferentially asymmetrically methylated histone H4R3 in vitro. Genetic disruption of AtPRMT10 resulted in late flowering by upregulating FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcript levels. In addition, we show that AtPRMT10 functions genetically separate from AtPRMT5, but that each acts to fine-tune expression of FLC. This work adds an extra layer of complexity to flowering-time regulation and also sheds light on the importance of asymmetric arginine methylation in plant development."
19649248,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2008,Tetratricopeptide repeat proteins Tom70 and Tom71 mediate yeast mitochondrial morphogenesis.,"The maintenance of correct mitochondrial shape requires numerous proteins that act on the surface or inside of the organelle. Although the soluble F-box protein Mfb1 was recently found to associate peripherally with mitochondria and to regulate organelle connectivity in budding yeast, how it localizes to mitochondria is unknown. Here, we show that two tetratricopeptide repeat proteins-the general preprotein import receptor Tom70 (a component of translocase of the outer membrane) and its paralogue Tom71-are required for Mfb1 mitochondrial localization. Mitochondria in cells lacking Tom70 and Tom71 form short tubules and aggregates, aberrant morphologies similar to those observed in the mfb1-null mutant. In addition, Mfb1 interacts with Tom71 in vivo, and binds to mitochondria through Tom70 in vitro. Our data indicate an unexpected role for Tom70 in recruitment of soluble proteins to the mitochondrial surface, and indicate that Tom71 has a specialized role in Mfb1-mediated mitochondrial morphogenesis."
19649272,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,In vitro analyses of the production and activity of secondary small interfering RNAs in C. elegans.,"In the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play important roles as intermediates. Primary siRNAs are produced from trigger dsRNAs by an RNaseIII-related enzyme called Dicer; in some organisms, secondary siRNAs are also produced by processes involving RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), which act on target mRNAs. Using a cell-free assay system prepared from Caenorhabditis elegans, we analyzed the production and activity of secondary siRNAs. In this cell-free system, RdRP activity acts on mRNA-derived templates to produce small RNAs. The RRF-1 complex is predominantly responsible for the RdRP activity, and synthesizes secondary-type siRNA molecules in a Dicer-independent manner. Notably, secondary-type siRNAs induce a prominent Slicer activity to cleave target mRNAs far more effectively than primary-type siRNAs. An Argonaute protein, CSR-1, is responsible for the Slicer activity induced by secondary-type siRNAs. Secondary rather than primary siRNAs may play a major role in the destabilization of target transcripts during RNAi in C. elegans."

Poxviruses replicate in cytoplasmic foci known as DNA factories. Here we show that a virus-encoded transcription factor, viral mRNA, cellular RNA-binding protein heterodimer G3BP/Caprin-1 (p137), translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G, and ribosomal proteins are concentrated in the same subdomains of cytoplasmic DNA factories. Furthermore, a cell coinfected with two recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing a virus core protein fused to cyan or yellow fluorescent protein displayed separate cyan and yellow factories, indicating that each factory formed from a single genome and was the site of transcription and translation as well as DNA replication. Hijacking of the host translation apparatus within the factory likely enhances the efficiency of virus replication and contributes to the suppression of host protein synthesis, thereby facilitating poxvirus subjugation of the cell."
19649296,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,IL-1 receptor accessory protein is essential for IL-33-induced activation of T lymphocytes and mast cells.,"Lack of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) abrogates responses to IL-33 and IL-1 in the mouse thymoma clone EL-4 D6/76 cells. Reconstitution with full-length IL-1RAcP is sufficient to restore responsiveness to IL-33 and IL-1. IL-33 activates IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1, cJun-N-terminal kinase, and the NF-kappaB pathway in an IL-1RAcP-dependent manner and results in IL-2 release. IL-33 is able to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived (BMD) mast cells, indicating that IL-33 may have a proinflammatory potential like its relatives IL-1 and IL-18, in addition to its Th2-skewing properties in the adaptive response described previously. Blocking of murine IL-1RAcP with the neutralizing antibody 4C5 inhibits response of mouse thymoma cells and BMD mast cells to IL-33. The interaction of either membrane-bound or soluble forms of IL-1RAcP and IL-33Ralpha-chain depends on the presence of IL-33, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays. These data demonstrate that IL-1RAcP is indispensable for IL-33 signaling. Furthermore, they suggest that IL-1RAcP is used by more than one alpha-chain of the IL-1 receptor family and thus may resemble a common beta-chain of that family."
19649319,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Identification of JmjC domain-containing UTX and JMJD3 as histone H3 lysine 27 demethylases.,"Covalent modifications of histones, such as acetylation and methylation, play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Histone lysine methylation has been implicated in both gene activation and repression, depending on the specific lysine (K) residue that becomes methylated and the state of methylation (mono-, di-, or trimethylation). Methylation on K4, K9, and K36 of histone H3 has been shown to be reversible and can be removed by site-specific demethylases. However, the enzymes that antagonize methylation on K27 of histone H3 (H3K27), an epigenetic mark important for embryonic stem cell maintenance, Polycomb-mediated gene silencing, and X chromosome inactivation have been elusive. Here we show the JmjC domain-containing protein UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome), as well as the related JMJD3 (jumonji domain containing 3), specifically removes methyl marks on H3K27 in vitro. Further, the demethylase activity of UTX requires a catalytically active JmjC domain. Finally, overexpression of UTX and JMJD3 leads to reduced di- and trimethylation on H3K27 in cells, suggesting that UTX and JMJD3 may function as H3K27 demethylases in vivo. The identification of UTX and JMJD3 as H3K27-specific demethylases provides direct evidence to indicate that similar to methylation on K4, K9, and K36 of histone H3, methylation on H3K27 is also reversible and can be dynamically regulated by site-specific histone methyltransferases and demethylases."
19650646,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Crystal structure of measles virus hemagglutinin provides insight into effective vaccines.,"Measles still remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Measles virus (MV) vaccines are highly successful, but the mechanism underlying their efficacy has been unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the MV attachment protein, hemagglutinin, responsible for MV entry. The receptor-binding head domain exhibits a cubic-shaped beta-propeller structure and forms a homodimer. N-linked sugars appear to mask the broad regions and cause the two molecules forming the dimer to tilt oppositely toward the horizontal plane. Accordingly, residues of the putative receptor-binding site, highly conserved among MV strains, are strategically positioned in the unshielded area of the protein. These conserved residues also serve as epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, ensuring the serological monotype, a basis for effective MV vaccines. Our findings suggest that sugar moieties in the MV hemagglutinin critically modulate virus-receptor interaction as well as antiviral antibody responses, differently from sugars of the HIV gp120, which allow for immune evasion."
19651049,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid inhibits PDK1 activation and suppresses experimental asthma by inducing T cell apoptosis.,"3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA), a compound generated during tryptophan metabolism initiated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, is known to induce T cell death, but its molecular target is not known. Here we report that HAA inhibits NF-kappaB activation upon T cell antigen receptor engagement by specifically targeting PDK1. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by HAA leads to dysfunction and cell death of activated Th2 cells, which in turn suppresses experimental asthma. Inhibition of NF-kappaB and induction of apoptosis is specific to CD4 T cells because HAA does not inhibit NF-kappaB activation or induce cell death upon Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation in dendritic cells. Thus, HAA is a natural inhibitor that restrains T cell expansion and activation."
19651142,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Evolution of heteromeric nitrilase complexes in Poaceae with new functions in nitrile metabolism.,"Members of the nitrilase 4 (NIT4) family of higher plants catalyze the conversion of beta-cyanoalanine to aspartic acid and asparagine, a key step in cyanide detoxification. Grasses (Poaceae) possess two different NIT4 homologs (NIT4A and NIT4B), but none of the recombinant Poaceae enzymes analyzed showed activity with beta-cyanoalanine, whereas protein extracts of the same plants clearly posses this activity. Sorghum bicolor contains three NIT4 isoforms SbNIT4A, SbNIT4B1, and SbNIT4B2. Individually, each isoform does not possess enzymatic activity whereas the heteromeric complexes SbNIT4A/B1 and SbNIT4A/B2 hydrolyze beta-cyanoalanine with high activity. In addition, the SbNIT4A/B2 complex accepts additional substrates, the best being 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. Corresponding NIT4A and NIT4B isoforms from other Poaceae species can functionally complement the sorghum isoforms in these complexes. Site-specific mutagenesis of the active site cysteine residue demonstrates that hydrolysis of beta-cyanoalanine is catalyzed by the NIT4A isoform in both complexes whereas hydrolysis of 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile occurs at the NIT4B2 isoform. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetonitrile was shown to be an in vitro breakdown product of the cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin, a main constituent in S. bicolor. The results indicate that the SbNIT4A/B2 heterocomplex plays a key role in an endogenous turnover of dhurrin proceeding via 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile and thereby avoiding release of toxic hydrogen cyanide. The operation of this pathway would enable plants to use cyanogenic glycosides as transportable and remobilizable nitrogenous storage compounds. Through combinatorial biochemistry and neofunctionalizations, the small family of nitrilases has gained diverse biological functions in nitrile metabolism."
19651599,0,Cell,413066,2007,RNF8 transduces the DNA-damage signal via histone ubiquitylation and checkpoint protein assembly.,"DNA-damage signaling utilizes a multitude of posttranslational modifiers as molecular switches to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Here we show that RNF8, a FHA/RING domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in the early DNA-damage response. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the FHA domain structure at 1.35 A. We have shown that RNF8 facilitates the accumulation of checkpoint mediator proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1 to the damaged chromatin, on one hand through the phospho-dependent FHA domain-mediated binding of RNF8 to MDC1, on the other hand via its role in ubiquitylating H2AX and possibly other substrates at damage sites. Moreover, RNF8-depleted cells displayed a defective G2/M checkpoint and increased IR sensitivity. Together, our study implicates RNF8 as a novel DNA-damage-responsive protein that integrates protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling and plays a critical role in the cellular response to genotoxic stress."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Structural basis for regulation of bifunctional roles in replication initiator protein.,"DNA replication initiator protein RepE stringently regulates F plasmid replication by its two distinct molecular association states. A predominant dimer functions as an autogenous repressor, whereas monomers act as replication initiators, and the dimer requires actions of the DnaK molecular chaperone system for monomerization. The structure of the monomeric form is known, whereas the dimeric structure and structural details of the dimer-to-monomer conversion have been unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of the RepE dimer in complex with the repE operator DNA. The dimerization interface is mainly formed by intermolecular beta-sheets with several key interactions of charged residues. The conformations of the internal N- and C-terminal domains are conserved between the dimer and monomer, whereas the relative domain orientations are strikingly different, allowing for an efficient oligomeric transition of dual-functional RepE. This domain relocation accompanies secondary structural changes in the linker connecting the two domains, and the linker is included in plausible DnaK/DnaJ-binding regions. These findings suggest an activation mechanism for F plasmid replication by RepE monomerization, which is induced and mediated by the DnaK system."
19651981,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,A distinct mechanism regulating a pollen-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rop in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Rop/Rac small GTPases are central to diverse developmental and cellular activities in plants, playing an especially important role in polar growth of pollen tubes. Although it is established that a class of plant-specific RopGEFs promotes the activity of Rop/Rac through the catalytic PRONE (Plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger) domain, not much is known about how RopGEF function is controlled to allow a spatiotemporally regulated Rop activity. To understand such a process in pollen, we performed functional analysis with a pollen-specific RopGEF, AtRopGEF12. Overexpression of AtRopGEF12 had minimal phenotypic effects, whereas overexpression of a C-terminally truncated version disturbed tube growth, suggesting that the C terminus was inhibitory to GEF function. In contrast to non-pollen-expressed RopGEFs, pollen-expressed RopGEFs have conserved C termini. A phospho-mimicking mutation at an invariant serine within the C terminus of AtRopGEF12 resulted in loss of the C-terminal inhibition, suggesting that phosphorylation regulates GEF activity in vivo. The PRONE domain of AtRopGEF12 (PRONE12) was not sufficient to induce isotropic tube growth. We used mbSUS to show that AtRopGEF12 interacts with an Arabidopsis pollen receptor kinase AtPRK2a through its C terminus, and BiFC to show that they interact in pollen tubes. Coexpression of AtRopGEF12 and AtPRK2a caused isotropic growth reminiscent of that seen upon overexpression of a constitutively active (CA) Rop. Coexpression of AtPRK2a with an N-terminally truncated AtRopGEF12 did not induce isotropic growth, indicating a positive role for the N-terminal domain. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the noncatalytic domains of pollen-specific/enriched RopGEFs regulate PRONE function, leading to polarized pollen tube growth."

PCC6803.,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play crucial roles in protein function for a variety of biological processes. Data from large-scale PPI screening has contributed to understanding the function of a large number of predicted genes from fully sequenced genomes. Here, we report the systematic identification of protein interactions for the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. Using a modified high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assay, we screened 1825 genes selected primarily from (i) genes of two-component signal transducers of Synechocystis, (ii) Synechocystis genes whose homologues are conserved in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and (iii) genes of unknown function on the Synechocystis chromosome. A total of 3236 independent two-hybrid interactions involving 1920 proteins (52% of the total protein coding genes) were identified and each interaction was evaluated using an interaction generality (IG) measure, as well as the general features of interacting partners. The interaction data obtained in this study should provide new insights and novel strategies for functional analyses of genes in Synechocystis, and, additionally, genes in other cyanobacteria and plant genes of cyanobacterial origin."

Here we report our identification of an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ protein, ANCCA/pro2000, endowed with a bromodomain that is strongly induced by estrogen in human breast cancer cells and is a direct target of protooncogene ACTR/AIB1/SRC-3. We found that ANCCA associates directly with estrogen-bound estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ACTR. It is selectively recruited, upon estrogen stimulation, to a subset of ERalpha target genes including cyclin D1, c-myc, and E2F1 and is required for their estrogen-induced expression as well as breast cancer cell proliferation. Further studies indicate that ANCCA binds and hydrolyzes ATP and is critical for recruitment of coregulator CBP and histone hyperacetylation at the ER target chromatin. Moreover, mutations at the ATP binding motifs rendered ANCCA defective as a coactivator in mediating estrogen induction of gene expression. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected layer of regulatory mechanism in hormone signaling mediated by ANCCA and suggest that hormone-induced assembly of transcriptional coregulator complexes at chromatin is a process facilitated by AAA+ ATPase proteins."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Structure of PlcR: Insights into virulence regulation and evolution of quorum sensing in Gram-positive bacteria.,"Gram-positive bacteria use a wealth of extracellular signaling peptides, so-called autoinducers, to regulate gene expression according to population densities. These &quot;quorum sensing&quot; systems control vital processes such as virulence, sporulation, and gene transfer. Using x-ray analysis, we determined the structure of PlcR, the major virulence regulator of the Bacillus cereus group, and obtained mechanistic insights into the effects of autoinducer binding. Our structural and phylogenetic analysis further suggests that all of those quorum sensors that bind directly to their autoinducer peptide derive from a common ancestor and form a single family (the RNPP family, for Rap/NprR/PlcR/PrgX) with conserved features. As a consequence, fundamentally different processes in different bacterial genera appear regulated by essentially the same autoinducer recognition mechanism. Our results shed light on virulence control by PlcR and elucidate origin and evolution of multicellular behavior in bacteria."

One example of such a network in Escherichia coli is the signal transduction cascade from the EvgS/EvgA system to the PhoQ/PhoP system, where activation of the EvgS/EvgA system promotes expression of PhoP-activated genes. As a factor connecting this signal transduction cascade, we have identified a small inner membrane protein (65 aa), B1500. Expression of the b1500 gene is directly regulated by the EvgS/EvgA system, and b1500 expression from a heterologous promoter simultaneously activated the expression of mgtA and other PhoP regulon genes. This activation was PhoQ/PhoP-dependent and EvgS/EvgA-independent. Furthermore, deletion of b1500 from an EvgS-activated strain suppressed mgtA expression. B1500 is localized in the inner membrane, and bacterial two-hybrid data showed that B1500 formed a complex with the sensor PhoQ. These results indicate that the small membrane protein, B1500, connected the signal transduction between EvgS/EvgA and PhoQ/PhoP systems by directly interacting with PhoQ, thus activating the PhoQ/PhoP system."

During assembly of the yeast mitochondrial fission complex, the outer membrane protein Fis1 recruits the dynamin-related GTPase Dnm1 to mitochondria. Fis1 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and interacts with Dnm1 via the molecular adaptors Mdv1 and Caf4. By using crystallographic analysis of adaptor-Fis1 complexes, we show that these adaptors use two helices to bind to both the concave and convex surfaces of the Fis1 TPR domain. Fis1 therefore contains two interaction interfaces, a binding mode that, to our knowledge, has not been observed previously for TPR domains. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that both binding interfaces are important for binding of Mdv1 and Caf4 to Fis1 and for mitochondrial fission activity in vivo. Our results reveal how Fis1 recruits the mitochondrial fission complex and will facilitate efforts to manipulate mitochondrial fission."

SOCS assemble as SH2 domain substrate recognition modules in ElonginB/C-cullin ubiquitin ligases. In accordance, SOCS4 reduces STAT3 signaling from EGFR through increased receptor degradation. Variable C-termini in SOCS4-SOCS7 exclude these family members from a SOCS2-type domain arrangement in which a strictly conserved C terminus determines domain packing. The structure of the SOCS4-ElonginC-ElonginB complex reveals a distinct SOCS structural class. The N-terminal ESS helix functionally replaces the CIS/SOCS1-SOCS3 family C terminus in a distinct SH2-SOCS box interface that facilitates further interdomain packing between the extended N- and C-terminal regions characteristic for this subfamily. Using peptide arrays and calorimetry the STAT3 site in EGFR (pY(1092)) was identified as a high affinity SOCS4 substrate (K(D) = 0.5 microM) revealing a mechanism for EGFR degradation. SOCS4 also bound JAK2 and KIT with low micromolar affinity, whereas SOCS2 was specific for GH-receptor."

A Cep3p dimer recruits a Skp1p-Ctf13p heterodimer and contacts two sites on CDEIII. We report here the crystal structure, determined at 2.8 A resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering, of a truncated Cep3p (Cep3p [47-608]), comprising all but an N-terminal, Zn(2)Cys(6)-cluster, DNA-binding module. Cep3p has a well-ordered structure throughout essentially all of its polypeptide chain, unlike most yeast transcription factors, including those with Zn(2)Cys(6) clusters, such as Gal4p. This difference may reflect an underlying functional distinction: whereas any particular transcription factor must adapt to a variety of upstream activating sites, Cep3p scaffolds kinetochore assembly on centromeres uniformly configured on all 16 yeast chromosomes. We have, using the structure of Cep3p (47-608) and the known structures of Zn(2)Cys(6)-cluster domains, modeled the interaction of Cep3p with CDEIII."

These protein-bound organelles catalyze HCO3- dehydration and photosynthetic CO2 fixation. In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 these reactions involve the beta-class carbonic anhydrase (CA), CcaA, and Form 1B ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The surrounding shell is thought to be composed of proteins encoded by the ccmKLMN operon, although little is known about how structural and catalytic proteins integrate to form a functional carboxysome. Using biochemical activity assays and molecular approaches we have identified a catalytic, multiprotein HCO3- dehydration complex (BDC) associated with the protein shell of Synechocystis carboxysomes. The complex was minimally composed of a CcmM73 trimer, CcaA dimer, and CcmN. Larger native complexes also contained RbcL, RbcS, and two or three immunologically identified smaller forms of CcmM (62, 52, and 36 kDa). Yeast two-hybrid analyses indicated that the BDC was associated with the carboxysome shell through CcmM73-specific protein interactions with CcmK and CcmL. Protein interactions between CcmM73 and CcaA, CcmM73 and CcmN, or CcmM73 and itself required the N-terminal gamma-CA-like domain of CcmM73. The specificity of the CcmM73-CcaA interaction provided both a mechanism to integrate CcaA into the fabric of the carboxysome shell and a means to recruit this enzyme to the BDC during carboxysome biogenesis. Functionally, CcaA was the catalytic core of the BDC. CcmM73 bound H14CO3- but was unable to catalyze HCO3- dehydration, suggesting that it may potentially regulate BDC activity."

Influenza virus reverse-genetics systems facilitate the study of the structure and function of viral factors. In contrast, less is known about host factors involved in the replication process. Here, we developed a replication and transcription system of the negative-strand RNA genome of the influenza virus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which depends on viral RNAs, viral RNA polymerases, and nucleoprotein (NP). Disruption of SUB2 encoding an orthologue of human RAF-2p48/UAP56, a previously identified viral RNA synthesis stimulatory host factor, resulted in reduction of the viral RNA synthesis rate. Using a genome-wide set of yeast single-gene deletion strains, we found several host factor candidates affecting viral RNA synthesis. We found that among them, Tat-SF1, a mammalian homologue of yeast CUS2, was a stimulatory host factor in influenza virus RNA synthesis. Tat-SF1 interacted with free NP, but not with NP associated with RNA, and facilitated formation of RNA-NP complexes.

The structure of a subcomplex comprising the C-terminal N7-methyl-transferase (MT) domain of the large D1 subunit, the stimulatory D12 subunit and bound S-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHcy) has been determined at 2.7 A resolution and reveals several novel features of the poxvirus capping enzyme. The structure shows for the first time the critical role played by the proteolytically sensitive N-terminus of the MT domain in binding the methyl donor and in catalysis. In addition, the poxvirus enzyme has a completely unique mode of binding of the adenosine moiety of AdoHcy, a feature that could be exploited for design of specific anti-poxviral compounds. The structure of the poxvirus-specific D12 subunit suggests that it was originally an RNA cap 2'O-MT that has evolved to a catalytically inactive form that has been retained for D1 stabilisation and MT activity enhancement through an allosteric mechanism."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Dimerization of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor potentiates hormone-dependent receptor phosphorylation.,"The G protein-coupled thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor forms homodimers. Regulated receptor dimerization increases TRH-induced receptor endocytosis. These studies test whether dimerization increases receptor phosphorylation, which could potentiate internalization. Phosphorylation at residues 355-365, which is critical for internalization, was measured with a highly selective phospho-site-specific antibody. Two strategies were used to drive receptor dimerization. Dimerization of a TRH receptor-FK506-binding protein (FKBP) fusion protein was stimulated by a dimeric FKBP ligand. The chemical dimerizer caused a large increase in TRH-dependent phosphorylation within 1 min, whereas a monomeric FKBP ligand had no effect. The dimerizer did not alter phoshorylation of receptors lacking the FKBP domain. Dimerization of receptors containing an N-terminal HA epitope also was induced with anti-HA antibody. Anti-HA IgG strongly increased TRH-induced phosphorylation, whereas monomeric Fab fragments had no effect. Anti-HA antibody did not alter phosphorylation in receptors lacking an HA tag. Furthermore, two phosphorylation-defective TRH receptors functionally complemented one another and permitted phosphorylation. Receptors with a D71A mutation in the second transmembrane domain do not signal, whereas receptors with four Ala mutations in the 355-365 region signal normally but lack phosphorylation sites. When D71A- and 4Ala-TRH receptors were expressed alone, neither underwent TRH-dependent phosphorylation. When they were expressed together, D71A receptor was phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases in response to TRH. These results suggest that the TRH receptor is phosphorylated preferentially when it is in dimers or when preexisting receptor dimers are driven into microaggregates. Increased receptor phosphorylation may amplify desensitization."

We identified a genomic deletion (0.4 Mb) involving the entire GRIA3 (encoding iGluR3) by using an X-array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and four missense variants (G833R, M706T, R631S, and R450Q) in functional domains of iGluR3 by sequencing 400 males with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Three variants were found in males with moderate MR and were absent in 500 control males. Expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that G833R resulted in a 78% reduction of iGluR3 due to protein misfolding. Whole-cell recording studies of iGluR3 homomers in HEK293 cells revealed that neither iGluR3-M706T (S2 domain) nor iGluR3-R631S (near channel core) had substantial channel function, whereas R450Q (S1 domain) was associated with accelerated receptor desensitization. When forming heteromeric receptors with iGluR2 in HEK293 cells, all four iGluR3 variants had altered desensitization kinetics. Our study provides the genetic and functional evidence that mutant iGluR3 with altered kinetic properties is associated with moderate cognitive impairment in humans."
19654879,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Mechanism of degradation of CPEB during Xenopus oocyte maturation.,"CPEB, a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein, plays an important role in translational control of maternal mRNAs in early animal development. During Xenopus oocyte maturation, CPEB undergoes a Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation that is required for proper entry into meiosis II. However, the precise mechanism of CPEB degradation, including the identity of the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligase, is not known. Here, we show that the SCF(beta-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets CPEB for degradation during Xenopus oocyte maturation. beta-TrCP, the F-box protein of SCF(beta-TrCP), specifically binds to a sequence (190)TSGFSS(195) (termed here the TSG motif) of CPEB, thereby targeting CPEB for degradation. beta-TrCP binding depends on phosphorylation of Thr-190, Ser-191, and Ser-195 in the TSG motif. Among these residues, Ser-191 is phosphorylated by the Polo-like kinase Plx1, which binds CPEB at a specific Thr-125 residue prephosphorylated by Cdc2. Finally, Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of other multiple Ser residues, previously implicated in CPEB degradation, is required for both Thr-125 phosphorylation and beta-TrCP binding, presumably causing conformational changes of CPEB. We propose that Cdc2 and Plx1 sequentially phosphorylate CPEB and target it for SCF(beta-TrCP)-dependent degradation in Xenopus oocytes. We suggest that many other proteins carrying the TSG-like motif may be targeted by SCF(beta-TrCP)."

We have studied the morphology and electrical conduction of fibrils made of an elastin-related polypeptide, poly(ValGlyGlyLeuGly). These amyloid-like nanofibrils, with a diameter ranging from 20 to 250 nm, result from self-assembly in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Their morphological properties and conductivity have been investigated by atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and two-terminal transport experiments at the micro- and nanoscales. We demonstrate that the nanofibrils can sustain significant electrical conduction in the solid state at ambient conditions and have remarkable stability. We also show intrinsic blue-green fluorescence of the nanofibrils by confocal microscopy analyses. These results indicate that direct (label-free) excitation can be used to investigate the aggregation state or the polymorphism of amyloid-like fibrils (and possibly of other proteinaceous material) and open up interesting perspectives for the use of peptide-based nanowire structures, with tunable physical and chemical properties, for a wide range of nanobiotechnological and bioelectronic applications."
19656571,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,Functional definition of outer membrane proteins involved in preprotein import into mitochondria.,"The role of plant mitochondrial outer membrane proteins in the process of preprotein import was investigated, as some of the principal components characterized in yeast have been shown to be absent or evolutionarily distinct in plants. Three outer membrane proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria were studied: TOM20 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), METAXIN, and mtOM64 (outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD). A single functional Arabidopsis TOM20 gene is sufficient to produce a normal multisubunit translocase of the outer membrane complex. Simultaneous inactivation of two of the three TOM20 genes changed the rate of import for some precursor proteins, revealing limited isoform subfunctionalization. Inactivation of all three TOM20 genes resulted in severely reduced rates of import for some but not all precursor proteins. The outer membrane protein METAXIN was characterized to play a role in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins and likely plays a role in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. An outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD (mtOM64) with high sequence similarity to a chloroplast import receptor was shown to interact with a variety of precursor proteins. All three proteins have domains exposed to the cytosol and interacted with a variety of precursor proteins, as determined by pull-down and yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. Furthermore, inactivation of one resulted in protein abundance changes in the others, suggesting functional redundancy. Thus, it is proposed that all three components directly interact with precursor proteins to participate in early stages of mitochondrial protein import."
19656848,1,Cell,413066,2007,Functional specificity of a Hox protein mediated by the recognition of minor groove structure.,"The recognition of specific DNA-binding sites by transcription factors is a critical yet poorly understood step in the control of gene expression. Members of the Hox family of transcription factors bind DNA by making nearly identical major groove contacts via the recognition helices of their homeodomains. In vivo specificity, however, often depends on extended and unstructured regions that link Hox homeodomains to a DNA-bound cofactor, Extradenticle (Exd). Using a combination of structure determination, computational analysis, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that Hox proteins recognize specific Hox-Exd binding sites via residues located in these extended regions that insert into the minor groove but only when presented with the correct DNA sequence. Our results suggest that these residues, which are conserved in a paralog-specific manner, confer specificity by recognizing a sequence-dependent DNA structure instead of directly reading a specific DNA sequence."
19656881,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2007,PTP1B contributes to the oncogenic properties of colon cancer cells through Src activation.,"Src-specific activity has been reported to be elevated in a high percentage of colon cancer cell lines and tumors, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we report that, in the seven cancer cell lines tested, Src-specific activity was elevated (5.2- to 18.7-fold) relative to normal colon cells (FHC). This activation of Src correlated with reduced phosphorylation at Y530 of Src, whereas there was no significant change in the level of phosphorylation at Y419. The membrane tyrosine phosphatase activity for a Src family-specific phosphopeptide substrate FCP (Fyn COOH-terminal peptide phosphorylated by Csk) was greatly increased in the cancer cells and was attributed to PTP1B in most of the cell lines. Membrane PTP1B protein levels were also greatly increased. Overexpression of PTP1B increased Src specific activity in colon cancer cells by reducing phosphorylation at Y530 of Src. It also increased anchorage-independent cell growth and this increase was blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2 and Src small interfering RNA (siRNA). Down-regulating PTP1B activity by PTP1B inhibitor CinnGEL 2Me or knocking down PTP1B using siRNA also reduced Src kinase activity and colony formation ability of colon cancer cells. PTP1B siRNA reduced tumor growth in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. This study suggests that (a) PTP1B can act as an important activator of Src in colon cancer cells via dephosphorylation at Y530 of Src and (b) elevated levels of PTP1B can increase tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells by activating Src."

A key virulence factor of H. pylori is the Cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a type IV secretion system. HP0525 is an essential component of the Cag system and acts as an inner membrane associated ATPase. HP0525 forms double hexameric ring structures, with the C-terminal domains (CTDs) forming a closed ring and the N-terminal domains (NTDs) forming a dynamic, open ring. Here, the crystal structure of HP0525 in complex with a fragment of HP1451, a protein of previously unknown function, is reported. The HP1451 construct consists of two domains similar to nucleic acid-binding domains. Two HP1451 molecules bind to the HP0525 NTDs on opposite sides of the hexamer, locking it in the closed form and forming a partial lid over the HP0525 chamber. From the structure, it is suggested that HP1451 acts as an inhibitory factor of HP0525 to regulate Cag-mediated secretion, a suggestion confirmed by results of in vitro ATPase assay and in vivo pull-down experiments."

In the mammalian bloodstream, antigenic variation of the VSG coat is the parasite's means to evade the immune response, while procyclin is necessary for effective establishment of trypanosome infection in the fly. Moreover, the exceptionally high efficiency of mono-allelic VSG expression is essential to bloodstream trypanosomes since its silencing caused rapid cell-cycle arrest in vitro and clearance of parasites from infected mice. Here we describe a novel protein complex that recognizes class I promoters and is indispensable for class I transcription; it consists of a dynein light chain and six polypeptides that are conserved only among trypanosomatid parasites. In accordance with an essential transcriptional function of the complex, silencing the expression of a key subunit was lethal to bloodstream trypanosomes and specifically affected the abundance of rRNA and VSG mRNA. The complex was dubbed class I transcription factor A."
19656910,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,RIP140 directs histone and DNA methylation to silence Ucp1 expression in white adipocytes.,"Nuclear receptors control the function of cells by regulating transcription from specific gene networks. The establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene marks is fundamental to the regulation of gene transcription and the control of cell function. RIP140 is a corepressor for nuclear receptors that suppresses transcription from a broad programme of metabolic genes and thereby controls energy homoeostasis in vivo. Here we show by analysis of Ucp1, a gene which is typically expressed in brown but not white adipocytes, that RIP140 is essential for both DNA and histone methylation to maintain gene repression. RIP140 expression promotes the assembly of DNA and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) on the Ucp1 enhancer and leads to methylation of specific CpG residues and histones as judged by bisulphite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our results suggest that RIP140 serves as a scaffold for both DNA and HMT activities to inhibit gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Analysis of sigma32 mutants defective in chaperone-mediated feedback control reveals unexpected complexity of the heat shock response.,"Protein quality control is accomplished by inducing chaperones and proteases in response to an altered cellular folding state. In Escherichia coli, expression of chaperones and proteases is positively regulated by sigma32. Chaperone-mediated negative feedback control of sigma32 activity allows this transcription factor to sense the cellular folding state. We identified point mutations in sigma32 altered in feedback control. Surprisingly, such mutants are resistant to inhibition by both the DnaK/J and GroEL/S chaperones in vivo and also show dramatically increased stability. Further characterization of the most defective mutant revealed that it has almost normal binding to chaperones and RNA polymerase and is competent for chaperone-mediated inactivation in vitro. We suggest that the mutants identify a regulatory step downstream of chaperone binding that is required for both inactivation and degradation of sigma32."
19657022,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Drosophila TRP channels require a protein with a distinctive motif encoded by the inaF locus.,"In both vertebrates and invertebrates, ion channels of the TRP superfamily are known to be influenced by a variety of accessory factors, but the list of interacting proteins is acknowledged to be incomplete. Although previous work showed that Drosophila TRP function is disrupted by mutations in the inaF locus, the mechanism of this effect has remained obscure. Here we show that a previously overlooked small protein, INAF-B, is encoded by the locus and fulfills its critical role in retinal physiology. The 81-aa INAF-B gene product is an integral membrane protein that colocalizes to rhabdomeres along with TRP channels. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the two proteins participate in a complex, and blotting experiments show that neither protein survives in the absence of the other. Both proteins are normally part of a large supramolecular assembly, the signalplex, but their interaction persists even in the absence of the scaffold for this structure. The inaF locus encodes three other proteins, each of which has diverged from INAF-B except for a 32-aa block of residues that encompasses a transmembrane domain. This conserved sequence defines an inaF motif, representatives of which are found in proteins from organisms as diverse as nematodes, fish, and humans. Given the role of INAF-B, these proteins are good candidates for interacting partners of other members of the TRP superfamily."
19657367,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,"SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2, a B-box protein in Arabidopsis that activates transcription and positively regulates light-mediated development.","CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) are two major regulators of light signaling in plants. Here, we identify SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2 (STH2) as a gene that interacts genetically with both of these key regulators. STH2 encodes a B-box-containing protein that interacts physically with HY5 in yeast and in plant cells. Whereas STH2 is uniformly nuclear by itself, it shows a COP1-dependent localization to speckles when coexpressed with COP1. We identified two independent T-DNA insertion lines in STH2. Both alleles are hyposensitive to blue, red, and far-red light. The sth2 mutant, like hy5, shows an enhanced number of lateral roots and accumulates less anthocyanin. Analysis of double mutants between sth2 and hy5 indicates that STH2 has both HY5-dependent and -independent functions. Furthermore, besides partially suppressing the hypocotyl phenotype of dark-grown cop1 alleles, sth2 also suppresses the reduced number of lateral roots and high anthocyanin levels in light-grown cop1 alleles. Interestingly, we found that STH2 can activate transcription. Transient transfection assays in protoplasts using a LUC reporter driven by the chalcone isomerase promoter show that the B-boxes in STH2 and a functional G-box element in the promoter are required for this activity. In conclusion, we have identified STH2, a B-box protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis and report that the B-box domain plays a direct role in activating transcription in plants."
19657387,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2007,A role for F-actin in hexokinase-mediated glucose signaling.,"HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has dual roles in glucose (Glc) signaling and in Glc phosphorylation. The cellular context, though, for HXK1 function in either process is not well understood. Here we have shown that within normal experimental detection limits, AtHXK1 is localized continuously to mitochondria. Two mitochondrial porin proteins were identified as capable of binding to overexpressed HXK1 protein, both in vivo and in vitro. We also found that AtHXK1 can be associated with its structural homolog, F-actin, based on their coimmunoprecipitation from transgenic plants that overexpress HXK1-FLAG or from transient expression assays, and based on their localization in leaf cells after cryofixation. This association might be functionally important because Glc signaling in protoplast transient expression assays is compromised by disruption of F-actin. We also demonstrate that Glc treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings rapidly and reversibly disrupts fine mesh actin filaments. The possible roles of actin in HXK-dependent Glc signaling are discussed."

Chem.,2985121R,2007,"53BP2S, interacting with insulin receptor substrates, modulates insulin signaling.","It is well known that insulin receptor substrates (IRS) act as a mediator for signal transduction of insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and several cytokines. To identify proteins that interact with IRS and modulate IRS-mediated signals, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with IRS-1 as bait. Out of 109 cDNA-positive clones identified from a human placental cDNA library, two clones encoded 53BP2, p53-binding protein 2 (53BP2S), a short form splicing variant of the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 that possesses Src homology region 3 domain, and ankyrin repeats domain, and had been reported to interact with p53, Bcl-2, and NF-kappaB. Interaction of 53BP2S with IRS-1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The Src homology region 3 domain and ankyrin repeats domain of 53BP2S were responsible for its interaction with IRS-1, whereas the phosphotyrosine binding domain and a central domain (amino acid residues 750-861) of IRS-1 were required for its interaction with 53BP2S. In CHO-C400 cells, expression of 53BP2S reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with a concomitant enhancement of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the amount of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and activation of Akt was enhanced by 53BP2S expression. Although 53BP2S also enhanced Akt activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin-induced glucose transporter 4 translocation was markedly inhibited in accordance with reduction of insulin-induced AS160 phosphorylation. Together these data demonstrate that 53BP2S interacts and modulates the insulin signals mediated by IRSs."

However, prominent atherosclerosis, which has been observed in LDL receptor (LDLR)-knockout mice, has diminished the significance of LDLR as a cause of atherosclerosis, while elaborate studies have focused on the receptors for denatured LDL. Here we report that native LDL (nLDL) activates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR1) but not VEGFR2 through LDLR and is as potent as VEGF in macrophage migration. Binding and co-endocytosis of VEGFR1 and LDLR were enhanced by nLDL, which is concomitant with ubiquitination-mediated degradation of VEGFR1. We propose that LDLR-mediated use of VEGFR1 by nLDL could be a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerotic disorders."
19660124,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Phosphorylation at Ser244 by CK1 determines nuclear localization and substrate targeting of PKD2.,"Protein kinase D2 (PKD2), a member of the PKD family of serine/threonine kinases, is localized in various subcellular compartments including the nucleus where the kinase accumulates upon activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. We define three critical post-translational modifications required for nuclear accumulation of PKD2 in response to activation of the CCK2 receptor (CCK2R): phosphorylation at Ser706 and Ser710 within the activation loop by PKC eta leading to catalytic activity and phosphorylation at Ser244 within the zinc-finger domain, which is crucial for blocking nuclear export of active PKD2 by preventing its interaction with the Crm-1 export machinery. We identify CK1delta and epsilon as upstream activated kinases by CCK2R that phosphorylate PKD2 at Ser244. Moreover, nuclear accumulation of active PKD2 is a prerequisite for efficient phosphorylation of its nuclear substrate, HDAC7. Only nuclear, active PKD2 mediates CCK2R-induced HDAC7 phosphorylation and Nur77 expression. Thus, we define a novel, compartment-specific signal transduction pathway downstream of CCK2R that phosphorylates PKD2 at three specific sites, results in nuclear accumulation of the active kinase and culminates in efficient phosphorylation of nuclear PKD2 substrates in human gastric cancer cells."

We have investigated NF-kappaB during the cell cycle and find that its ability to regulate the G1-phase expression of key proto-oncogenes is subject to regulation by the integrated activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha, IKKbeta, Akt and Chk1. The coordinated binding of NF-kappaB subunits to the Cyclin D1, c-Myc and Skp2 promoters is dynamic with distinct changes in promoter occupancy and RelA(p65) phosphorylation occurring through G1, S and G2 phases, concomitant with a switch from coactivator to corepressor recruitment. Akt activity is required for IKK-dependent phosphorylation of NF-kappaB subunits in G1 and G2 phases, where Chk1 is inactive. However, in S-phase, Akt is inactivated, while Chk1 phosphorylates RelA and associates with IKKalpha, inhibiting the processing of the p100 (NF-kappaB2) subunit, which also plays a critical role in the regulation of these genes. These data reveal a complex regulatory network integrating NF-kappaB with the DNA-replication checkpoint and the expression of critical regulators of cell proliferation."
19660432,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Protein requirements for sister telomere association in human cells.,"Previous studies in human cells indicate that sister telomeres have distinct requirements for their separation at mitosis. In cells depleted for tankyrase 1, a telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, sister chromatid arms and centromeres separate normally, but telomeres remain associated and cells arrest in mitosis. Here, we use biochemical and genetic approaches to identify proteins that might mediate the persistent association at sister telomeres. We use immunoprecipitation analysis to show that the telomeric proteins, TRF1 (an acceptor of PARsylation by tankyrase 1) and TIN2 (a TRF1 binding partner) each bind to the SA1 ortholog of the cohesin Scc3 subunit. Sucrose gradient sedimentation shows that TRF1 cosediments with the SA1-cohesin complex. Depletion of the SA1 cohesin subunit or the telomeric proteins (TRF1 and TIN2) restores the normal resolution of sister telomeres in mitosis in tankyrase 1-depleted cells. Moreover, depletion of TRF1 and TIN2 or SA1 abrogates the requirement for tankyrase 1 in mitotic progression. Our studies indicate that sister telomere association in human cells is mediated by a novel association between a cohesin subunit and components of telomeric chromatin."

Here we show that a major subgroup of PMD mutations that map into the extracellular loop region of PLP/DM20 leads to the failure of oligodendrocytes to form the correct intramolecular disulfide bridges. This leads to abnormal protein cross-links and endoplasmic reticulum retention and activates the unfolded protein response. Importantly, surface expression of mutant PLP/DM20 can be restored and the unfolded protein response can be reverted by the removal of two cysteines. Thus, covalent protein cross-links emerge as a cause, rather than as a consequence, of endoplasmic reticulum retention."

The biological activities of HMGA1 proteins are highly regulated by their post-translational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Recently, it was found that the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), a newly identified serine/threonine kinase, co-immunoprecipitated with, and phosphorylated, HMGA1 proteins. However, the sites and the biological significance of the phosphorylation have not been elucidated. Here, we found that HIPK2 phosphorylates HMGA1a at Ser-35, Thr-52, and Thr-77, and HMGA1b at Thr-41 and Thr-66. In addition, we demonstrated that cdc2, which is known to phosphorylate HMGA1 proteins, could induce the phosphorylation of HMGA1 proteins at the same Ser/Thr sites. The two kinases, however, exhibited different site preferences for the phosphorylation: The preference for HIPK2 phosphorylation followed the order of Thr-77 &gt; Thr-52 &gt; Ser-35, whereas the order for cdc2 phosphorylation was Thr-52 &gt; Thr-77 &gt; Ser-35. Moreover, we found that the HIPK2-phosphorylated HMGA1a reduced the binding affinity of HMGA1a to human germ line promoter, and the drop in binding affinity induced by HIPK2 phosphorylation was lower than that introduced by cdc2 phosphorylation, which is consistent with the notion that the second AT-hook in HMGA1a is more important for DNA binding than the third AT-hook."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Defined DNA sequences promote the assembly of a bacterial protein into distinct amyloid nanostructures.,"RepA, the replication initiator protein of Pseudomonas pPS10 plasmid, is made of two winged-helix (WH) domains. RepA dimers undergo a structural transformation upon binding to origin DNA sequences (iterons), resulting in monomerization and alpha-helix into beta-strand conversion. This affects the N-terminal domain (WH1) and generates a metastable intermediate. Here it is shown that the interaction of short dsDNA oligonucleotides, including iteron or operator RepA targets, with the isolated WH1 domain promotes the assembly of different nanostructures. These range from irregular aggregates to amyloid spheroids and fibers. Their intrinsic order inversely correlates with the extent of the transformation induced by each DNA sequence on RepA. However, DNA is not a constituent of the assembled fibers, in agreement with the protein-only principle for amyloid structure. Thus, the RepA-WH1 domain on DNA binding mimics the behavior of the mammalian prion protein. The stretch of amino acids responsible for WH1 aggregation has been identified, leading to the design of mutants with enhanced or reduced amyloidogenicity and the synthesis of a peptide that assembles into a cross-beta structure. RepA amyloid assemblies could have a role in the negative regulation of plasmid replication. This article underlines the potential of specific nucleic acid sequences in promoting protein amyloidogenesis at nearly physiological conditions."

In this article, we show that the actin-binding protein cortactin regulates the potassium channel Kv1.2 and thereby provides a direct link between actin dynamics and membrane excitability. In previous reports, we showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated suppression of Kv1.2 ionic current occurs by endocytosis of the channel protein. Pull-down assays using recombinant-purified cortactin and Kv1.2 demonstrated that their interaction is direct and reduced by tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2. This finding suggests a link between cortactin and Kv1.2 endocytosis. Here, we confirm that relationship and identify the molecular mechanisms involved. We use FRET to demonstrate that Kv1.2 and cortactin interact in vivo. By manipulating the cortactin-binding site within Kv1.2, we confirm that cortactin proximity influences channel function. We used flow cytometry in conjunction with cortactin gene replacement to identify C-terminal tyrosines, the fourth repeat actin-binding domain, and the N-terminal Arp2/3-binding region, as critical to Kv1.2 regulation. Surprisingly, cortactin's dynamin-binding Src homology 3 domain is not required for Kv1.2 endocytosis, despite that process being dynamin-dependent. These findings predict that cortactin-mediated actin remodeling in excitable cells is not only important for cell structure, but may directly impact membrane excitability."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,The crystal structure of the complex of PII and acetylglutamate kinase reveals how PII controls the storage of nitrogen as arginine.,"Photosynthetic organisms can store nitrogen by synthesizing arginine, and, therefore, feedback inhibition of arginine synthesis must be relieved in these organisms when nitrogen is abundant. This relief is accomplished by the binding of the PII signal transduction protein to acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK), the controlling enzyme of arginine synthesis. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the complex between NAGK and PII of Synechococcus elongatus, at 2.75-A resolution. We prove the physiological relevance of the observed interactions by site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. The complex consists of two polar PII trimers sandwiching one ring-like hexameric NAGK (a trimer of dimers) with the threefold axes of these molecules aligned. The binding of PII favors a narrow ring conformation of the NAGK hexamer that is associated with arginine sites having low affinity for this inhibitor. Each PII subunit contacts one NAGK subunit only. The contacts map in the inner circumference of the NAGK ring and involve two surfaces of the PII subunit. One surface is on the PII body and interacts with the C-domain of the NAGK subunit, helping widen the arginine site found on the other side of this domain. The other surface is at the distal region of a protruding large loop (T-loop) that presents a novel compact shape. This loop is inserted in the interdomain crevice of the NAGK subunit, contacting mainly the N-domain, and playing key roles in anchoring PII on NAGK, in activating NAGK, and in complex formation regulation by MgATP, ADP, 2-oxoglutarate, and by phosphorylation of serine-49."
19661712,1,Cell,413066,2007,Cordon-bleu is an actin nucleation factor and controls neuronal morphology.,"Despite the wealth of different actin structures formed, only two actin nucleation factors are well established in vertebrates: the Arp2/3 complex and formins. Here, we describe a further nucleator, cordon-bleu (Cobl). Cobl is a brain-enriched protein using three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domains for actin binding. Cobl promotes nonbundled, unbranched filaments. Filament formation relies on barbed-end growth and requires all three Cobl WH2 domains and the extended linker L2. We suggest that the nucleation power of Cobl is based on the assembly of three actin monomers in cross-filament orientation. Cobl localizes to sites of high actin dynamics and modulates cell morphology. In neurons, induction of both neurites and neurite branching is dramatically increased by Cobl expression-effects that critically depend on Cobl's actin nucleation ability. Correspondingly, Cobl depletion results in decreased dendritic arborization. Thus, Cobl is an actin nucleator controlling neuronal morphology and development."

The overall fold of the molecule is that of an alpha(6)/alpha(6) barrel. It is a two-domain protein, and the Cbl is bound at the interface of the domains in a base-on conformation. Surprisingly, two full-length molecules, each comprising an alpha- and a beta-domain and one Cbl, and two truncated molecules with only an alpha- domain are present in the same asymmetric unit. The environment around Cbl is dominated by uncharged residues, and the sixth coordinate position of Co(2+) is empty. A detailed comparison between the IF-B12 complex and another Cbl transport protein complex, trans-Cbl-B12, has been made. The pH effect on the binding of Cbl analogues in transport proteins is analyzed. A possible basis for the lack of interchangeability of human and rat IF receptors is presented."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,"The SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase regulates calcineurin signaling through degradation of phosphorylated Rcn1, an inhibitor of calcineurin.","The highly conserved RCN family of proteins regulates the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin, which is required for the expression of genes involved in Ca(2+)-dependent processes, such as the control of memory, apoptosis, T cell activation, cell cycle, Ca(2+)-homeostasis, and skeletal and cardiac muscle growth and differentiation. However, RCNs regulate calcineurin through two paradoxical actions: they act as feedback inhibitors of calcineurin, whereas their phosphorylation stimulates calcineurin. Here we show that phosphorylation of yeast RCN, Rcn1, triggers degradation through the SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitin ligase complex. Degradation of phosphorylated Rcn1 is required to mitigate inhibition of calcineurin by Rcn1 and results in activation of calcineurin activity in response to Ca(2+) as well as in reactivation of calcineurin in response to changes in Ca(2+) concentration. The SCF(Cdc4)-dependent degradation required phosphorylation of Rcn1 by Mck1, a member of the GSK3 family of protein kinases, and was promoted by Ca(2+). However, such degradation was counteracted by dephosphorylation of Rcn1, which was promoted by Ca(2+)-stimulated calcineurin. Thus, calcineurin activity is fine-tuned to Ca(2+) signals by mechanisms that have opposite functions. Our results identify the molecular mechanism of Rcn1 phosphorylation-induced stimulation of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. The results provide insight into the mechanism involved in maintaining proper responses to Ca(2+) signals."

Here, physiological and biochemical tests demonstrate interactions between 14-3-3s and the well-established mechanisms that govern light sensing and photoperiodic flowering control. Plants featuring homozygous disruption of 14-3-3 isoforms upsilon and mu display defects in light sensing and/or response. Mutant plants flower late and exhibit long hypocotyls under red light, with little effect under blue or far-red light. The long hypocotyl phenotype is consistent with a role for 14-3-3 upsilon and mu in phytochrome B signaling. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays indicate that 14-3-3 upsilon and mu proteins physically interact with CONSTANS, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway. Together, these data indicate a potential role for specific 14-3-3 isoforms in affecting photoperiodic flowering via interaction with CONSTANS, possibly as integrators of light signals sensed through the phytochrome system."

Here, we describe the identification of MIDGET (MID) as a novel component of topoisomerase VI. We show that mid mutants show the same phenotype as rhl1, rhl2, and top6B mutants and that MID protein physically interacts with RHL1. The phenotypic analysis revealed new phenotypes, indicating that topoisomerase VI is involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional silencing. In addition, genetic evidence is provided suggesting that the ATR-dependent DNA damage repair checkpoint is activated in mid mutants, and CYCB1;1 is ectopically activated. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of CYCB1;2 can rescue the endoreduplication defects in mid mutants, suggesting that in mid mutants, a specific checkpoint is activated preventing further progression of endoreduplication cycles."

AtRGS1 is a seven-transmembrane, RGS domain-containing protein that is a putative membrane receptor for d-glucose. Here we show, by using FRET, that d-glucose alters the interaction between the AtGPA1 and AtRGS1 in vivo. AtGPA1 is a unique heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit that is constitutively GTP-bound given its high spontaneous nucleotide exchange coupled with slow GTP hydrolysis. Analysis of a point mutation in AtRGS1 that abrogates GTPase-accelerating activity demonstrates that the regulation of AtGPA1 GTP hydrolysis mediates sugar signal transduction during Arabidopsis development, in contrast to animals where nucleotide exchange is the limiting step in the heterotrimeric G protein nucleotide cycle."

For example, depending on the cellular context, the cdk inhibitors can affect cell proliferation, cell motility, apoptosis, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and transcription. Thus, to determine how a protein contributes to tumorigenesis, we need to evaluate which functions are required in the developing tumor. Here we demonstrate that the RCAS/TvA system, originally developed to introduce oncogenes into somatic cells of mice, can be adapted to allow us to define the contribution that different functional domains make to tumor development. Studying the development of growth-factor-induced oligodendroglioma, we identified a critical role for the Cy elements in p21, and we showed that cyclin D1T286A, which accumulates in the nucleus of p21-deficient cells and binds to cdk4, could bypass the requirement for p21 during tumor development. These genetic results suggest that p21 acts through the cyclin D1-cdk4 complex to support tumor growth, and establish the utility of using a somatic cell modeling system for defining the contribution proteins make to tumor development."
19665993,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Malt1 ubiquitination triggers NF-kappaB signaling upon T-cell activation.,"Triggering of antigen receptors on lymphocytes is critical for initiating adaptive immune response against pathogens. T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement induces the formation of the Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex that is essential for activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms that link CBM complex formation to IKK activation remain unclear. Here we report that Malt1 is polyubiquitinated upon T-cell activation. Ubiquitin chains on Malt1 provide a docking surface for the recruitment of the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKgamma. TRAF6 associates with Malt1 in response to T-cell activation and can function as an E3 ligase for Malt1 in vitro and in vivo, mediating lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of Malt1. Multiple lysine residues in the C-terminus of Malt1 serve as acceptor sites for the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. Malt1 mutants that lack C-terminal ubiquitin acceptor lysines are impaired in rescuing NF-kappaB signaling and IL-2 production in Malt1-/- T cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that induced Malt1 ubiquitination is critical for the engagement of CBM and IKK complexes, thereby directing TCR signals to the canonical NF-kappaB pathway."
19666002,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,The proteasome maturation protein POMP facilitates major steps of 20S proteasome formation at the endoplasmic reticulum.,"The quality control of proteins mediated by the plasticity of the proteasome system is regulated by the timely and flexible formation of this multisubunit proteolytic enzyme complex. Adaptable biogenesis of the 20S proteasome core complex is therefore of vital importance for adjusting to changing proteolytic requirements. However, the molecular mechanism and the cellular sites of mammalian proteasome formation are still unresolved. By using precursor complex-specific antibodies, we now show that the main steps in 20S core complex formation take place at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thereby, the proteasome maturation protein (POMP)--an essential factor of mammalian proteasome biogenesis--interacts with ER membranes, binds to alpha1-7 rings, recruits beta-subunits stepwise and mediates the association of mammalian precursor complexes with the ER. Thus, POMP facilitates the main steps in 20S core complex formation at the ER to coordinate the assembly process and to provide cells with freshly formed proteasomes at their site of function."
19666033,1,J. Gen. Virol.,77340,2007,Protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 is a target of the E6 oncoprotein of high-risk genital human papillomaviruses.,"The E6 proteins of high-risk genital human papillomaviruses (HPV), such as HPV types 16 and 18, possess a conserved C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which mediates interaction with some cellular PDZ domain proteins. The binding of E6 usually results in their ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The ability of E6 to bind to PDZ domain proteins correlates with the oncogenic potential. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, GST pull-down experiments and coimmunoprecipitations, we identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1/PTPN3) as a novel target of the PDZ-binding motif of E6 of HPV16 and 18. PTPH1 has been suggested to function as tumour suppressor protein, since mutational analysis revealed somatic mutations in PTPH1 in a minor fraction of various human tumours. We show here that HPV16 E6 accelerated the proteasome-mediated degradation of PTPH1, which required the binding of E6 to the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and to PTPH1. The endogenous levels of PTPH1 were particularly low in HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines. The reintroduction of the E2 protein into the HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cell line SiHa, known to lead to a sharp repression of E6 expression and to induce growth suppression, resulted in an increase of the amount of PTPH1. Our data suggest that reducing the level of PTPH1 may contribute to the oncogenic activity of high-risk genital E6 proteins."

Selective RXR ligands, referred to as rexinoids, are already used or are being developed for cancer therapy and have promise for the treatment of metabolic diseases. However, important side effects remain associated with existing rexinoids. Here we describe the rational design and functional characterization of a spectrum of RXR modulators ranging from partial to pure antagonists and demonstrate their utility as tools to probe the implication of RXRs in cell biological phenomena. One of these ligands renders RXR activity particularly sensitive to coactivator levels and has the potential to act as a cell-specific RXR modulator. A combination of crystallographic and fluorescence anisotropy studies reveals the molecular details accounting for the agonist-to-antagonist transition and provides direct experimental evidence for a correlation between the pharmacological activity of a ligand and its impact on the structural dynamics of the activation helix H12. Using RXR and its cognate ligands as a model system, our correlative analysis of 3D structures and dynamic data provides an original view on ligand actions and enables the establishment of mechanistic concepts, which will aid in the development of selective nuclear receptor modulators."
19666518,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2008,Spontaneous assembly of photosynthetic supramolecular complexes as mediated by the intrinsically unstructured protein CP12.,"CP12 is a protein of 8.7 kDa that contributes to Calvin cycle regulation by acting as a scaffold element in the formation of a supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in photosynthetic organisms. NMR studies of recombinant CP12 (isoform 2) of Arabidopsis thaliana show that CP12-2 is poorly structured. CP12-2 is monomeric in solution and contains four cysteines, which can form two intramolecular disulfides with midpoint redox potentials of -326 and -352 mV, respectively, at pH 7.9. Site-specific mutants indicate that the C-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between CP12-2 and GAPDH (isoform A(4)), whereas the N-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between this binary complex and PRK. In the presence of NAD, oxidized CP12-2 interacts with A(4)-GAPDH (K(D) = 0.18 microm) to form a binary complex of 170 kDa with (A(4)-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)(2) stoichiometry, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and multiangle light scattering analysis. PRK is a dimer and by interacting with this binary complex (K(D) = 0.17 microm) leads to a 498-kDa ternary complex constituted by two binary complexes and two PRK dimers, i.e. ((A(4)-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)(2)-(PRK))(2). Thermodynamic parameters indicate that assembly of both binary and ternary complexes is exoergonic although penalized by a decrease in entropy that suggests an induced folding of CP12-2 upon binding to partner proteins. The redox dependence of events leading to supramolecular complexes is consistent with a role of CP12 in coordinating the reversible inactivation of chloroplast enzymes A(4)-GAPDH and PRK during darkness in photosynthetic tissues."

This regulation of protein activity allows more diversity in the control of gene expression. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was originally identified as a regulator of IFN-alpha/beta, and its expression is induced by viral infection or IFN stimulation. Accumulating evidence supports the theory that IRF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor and represses the transformed phenotype. Here we report that the level of SUMOylated IRF-1 is elevated in tumors. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments disclose that the SUMOylation sites of IRF-1 are identical to the major ubiquitination sites. Consequently, SUMOylated IRF-1 displays enhanced resistance to degradation. SUMOylation of IRF-1 attenuates its transcription activity, and SUMOylated IRF-1 inhibits apoptosis by repression of its transcriptional activity. These data support a mechanism whereby SUMOylation of IRF-1 inactivates its tumor suppressor function, which facilitates resistance to the immune response."

Analysis of the V. para genome revealed a type III secretion system effector, VopL, encoding three Wiskott-Aldrich homology 2 domains that are interspersed with three proline-rich motifs. Infection of HeLa cells with V. para induces the formation of long actin fibers in a VopL-dependent manner. Transfection of VopL promotes the assembly of actin stress fibers. In vitro, recombinant VopL potently induces assembly of actin filaments that grow at their barbed ends, independent of eukaryotic factors. Vibrio VopL is predicted to be a bacterial virulence factor that disrupts actin homeostasis during an enteric infection of the host."

In yeast, the Rrp44 protein constitutively associates with the CE and provides the sole source of processive 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity. Here we present EM reconstructions of the core and Rrp44-bound exosome complexes. The two-lobed Rrp44 protein binds to the RNase PH domain side of the exosome and buttresses the bottom of the exosome-processing chamber. The Rrp44 C-terminal body part containing an RNase II-type active site is anchored to the exosome through a conserved set of interactions mainly to the Rrp45 and Rrp43 subunit, whereas the Rrp44 N-terminal head part is anchored to the Rrp41 subunit and may function as a roadblock to restrict access of RNA to the active site in the body region. The Rrp44-exosome (RE) architecture suggests an active site sequestration mechanism for strict control of 3' exoribonuclease activity in the RE complex."

Influenza type B virus almost exclusively infects humans and contributes to the annual &quot;flu&quot; sickness. Here we report the structures of influenza B virus HA in complex with human and avian receptor analogs, respectively. These structures provide a structural basis for the different receptor-binding properties of influenza A and B virus HA molecules and for the ability of influenza B virus HA to distinguish human and avian receptors. The structure of influenza B virus HA with avian receptor analog also reveals how mutations in the region of residues 194 to 196, which are frequently observed in egg-adapted and naturally occurring variants, directly affect the receptor binding of the resultant virus strains. Furthermore, these structures of influenza B virus HA are compared with known structures of influenza A virus HAs, which suggests the role of the residue at 222 as a key and likely a universal determinant for the different binding modes of human receptor analogs by different HA molecules."

We have developed a novel system in which progression of phenotypes in a mouse model of pancreatic islet cell tumorigenesis can be used to measure the effects of genes introduced by cell-type-specific infection with retroviral vectors. In this system, bitransgenic mice, in which the rat insulin promoter (RIP) drives expression of both the SV40 T antigen (RIP-Tag) and the receptor for subgroup A avian leukosis virus (RIP-tva), are infected with avian viral vectors carrying cDNAs encoding candidate progression factors. Like RIP-Tag mice, RIP-Tag; RIP-tva bitransgenic mice develop isolated carcinomas by approximately 14 wk of age, after progression through well-defined stages that are similar to aspects of human tumor progression, including hyperplasia, angiogenesis, adenoma, and invasive carcinoma. When avian retroviral vectors carrying a green fluorescent protein marker were introduced into RIP-Tag; RIP-tva mice by intra-cardiac injection at the hyperplastic or early dysplastic stage of tumorigenesis, approximately 20% of the TVA-positive cells were infected and expressed green fluorescent proteins as measured by flow cytometry. Similar infection with vectors carrying cDNA encoding either of two progression factors, a dominant-negative version of cadherin 1 (dnE-cad) or Bcl-xL, accelerated the formation of islet tumors with invasive properties and pancreatic lymph node metastasis. To begin studying the mechanism by which Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, promotes invasion and metastasis, RIP-Tag; RIP-tva pancreatic islet tumor cells were infected in vitro with RCASBP-Bcl-xL. Although no changes were observed in rates of proliferation or apoptosis, Bcl-xL altered cell morphology, remodeled the actin cytoskeleton, and down-regulated cadherin 1; it also induced cell migration and invasion, as evaluated using two-chamber transwell assays. In addition, myosin Va was identified as a novel Bcl-xL-interacting protein that might mediate the effects of Bcl-xL on tumor cell migration and invasion."

Several types of posttranslational modifications are clearly involved in controlling the distribution of AQP2 between intracellular vesicles and the apical plasma membrane. Little is known, however, about the protein interactions that govern the trafficking of AQP2 between these organelles. MAL is a detergent-resistant membrane-associated protein implicated in apical sorting events. We wondered, therefore, whether MAL plays a role in the regulated trafficking of AQP2 between intracellular vesicles and the apical surface. We find that AQP2 and MAL are coexpressed in epithelial cells of the kidney collecting duct. These two proteins interact, both in the native kidney and when expressed by transfection in cultured cells. The S256-phosphorylated form of AQP2 appears to interact more extensively with MAL than does the water channel protein not phosphorylated at this serine. We find that MAL is not involved in detergent-resistant membrane association or apical delivery of AQP2 in LLC-PK(1) renal epithelial cells. Instead, MAL increases the S256 phosphorylation and apical surface expression of AQP2. Furthermore, internalization experiments show that MAL induces surface expression of AQP2 by attenuating its internalization. Thus, the involvement of MAL in the cell surface retention of apical membrane proteins could play an important role in regulated absorption and secretion in transporting epithelia."

The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD and myogenin (Myog) direct the development of skeletal muscle and are thought to be dominant over the program of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. Myocardin (Myocd) is a serum response factor (SRF) coactivator that promotes SMC differentiation through transcriptional stimulation of SRF-dependent smooth muscle genes. Here we show by lineage-tracing studies that Myocd is expressed transiently in skeletal muscle progenitor cells of the somite, and a majority of skeletal muscle is derived from Myocd-expressing cell lineages. However, rather than activating skeletal muscle-specific gene expression, Myocd functions as a transcriptional repressor of Myog, inhibiting skeletal muscle differentiation while activating SMC-specific genes. This repressor function of Myocd is complex, involving histone deacetylase 5 silencing of the Myog promoter and Myocd's physical contact with MyoD, which undermines MyoD DNA binding and transcriptional synergy with MEF2. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for Myocd in repressing the skeletal muscle differentiation program and suggest that this transcriptional coregulator acts as a bifunctional molecular switch for the smooth versus skeletal muscle phenotypes."

Polyphosphate or ATP promote oligomerization of the enzyme in vitro. The DdPPK1 products are heterogeneous in chain length and shorter than those of E. coli. The unique DdPPK1 N-terminal domain was shown to be necessary for its enzymatic activity, cellular localization, and physiological functions.

Here, we generated mice carrying a floxed EGFR allele to inactivate the EGFR in fetal and adult liver. Perinatal deletion of EGFR in hepatocytes resulted in decreased body weight, whereas deletion in the adult liver did not affect body mass. Although liver function was not affected, after partial hepatectomy mice lacking EGFR in the liver showed increased mortality accompanied by increased levels of serum transaminases indicating liver damage. Liver regeneration was delayed in the mutants because of reduced hepatocyte proliferation. Analysis of cell cycle progression in EGFR-deficient livers indicated a defective G(1)-S phase entry with delayed transcriptional activation and reduced protein expression of cyclin D1 followed by reduced cdk2 and cdk1 expression. Impaired liver regeneration was accompanied by compensatory up-regulation of TNFalpha in the serum and prolonged activation of c-Jun. Moreover, p38alpha and NF-kappaB activation was reduced in regenerating mutant livers, indicating an impaired stress response after hepatectomy. Our studies demonstrate that EGFR is a critical regulator of hepatocyte proliferation in the initial phases of liver regeneration."

In response to an external stimulus, the complex is activated, resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IkappaB proteins. This event triggers the nuclear import of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which activates the transcription of genes that regulate a variety of fundamental biological processes, including immune response, cell survival, and development. Here, we define an essential role for IKK2 in normal mitotic progression and the maintenance of spindle bipolarity. Chemical and genetic perturbation of IKK2 promotes the formation of multipolar spindles and chromosome missegregation. Depletion of IKK2 results in the deregulation of Aurora A protein stability and coincident hyperactivation of a putative Aurora A substrate, the mitotic motor KIF11. These data support a function for IKK2 as an antagonist of Aurora A signaling during mitosis. Additionally, our results indicate a direct role for IKK2 in the maintenance of genome stability and underscore the potential for oncogenic consequences in targeting this kinase for therapeutic intervention."

Here we report the existence of a salt-inducible kinase-1 (SIK1) that associates constitutively with the NK regulatory complex and is responsible for increases in its catalytic activity following small elevations in intracellular sodium concentrations. Increases in intracellular sodium are paralleled by elevations in intracellular calcium through the reversible Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, leading to the activation of SIK1 (Thr-322 phosphorylation) by a calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase. Activation of SIK1 results in the dephosphorylation of the NK alpha-subunit and an increase in its catalytic activity. A protein phosphatase 2A/phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1) complex, which constitutively associates with the NK alpha-subunit, is activated by SIK1 through phosphorylation of PME-1 and its dissociation from the complex. These observations illustrate the existence of a distinct intracellular signaling network, with SIK1 at its core, which is triggered by a monovalent cation (Na(+)) and links sodium permeability to its active transport."
19667130,0,Structure,101087697,2007,Structural and functional characterization of the human protein kinase ASK1.,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) plays an essential role in stress and immune response and has been linked to the development of several diseases. Here, we present the structure of the human ASK1 catalytic domain in complex with staurosporine. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and crystallographic analysis showed that ASK1 forms a tight dimer (K(d) approximately 0.2 microM) interacting in a head-to-tail fashion. We found that the ASK1 phosphorylation motifs differ from known ASK1 phosphorylation sites but correspond well to autophosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry. Reporter gene assays showed that all three identified in vitro autophosphorylation sites (Thr813, Thr838, Thr842) regulate ASK1 signaling, but site-directed mutants showed catalytic activities similar to wild-type ASK1, suggesting a regulatory mechanism independent of ASK1 kinase activity. The determined high-resolution structure of ASK1 and identified ATP mimetic inhibitors will provide a first starting point for the further development of selective inhibitors."
19667172,0,PLoS Genet.,101239074,2007,The interplay of RecA-related proteins and the MND1-HOP2 complex during meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recognize each other, align, and exchange genetic information. This process requires the action of RecA-related proteins Rad51 and Dmc1 to catalyze DNA strand exchanges. The Mnd1-Hop2 complex has been shown to assist in Dmc1-dependent processes. Furthermore, higher eukaryotes possess additional RecA-related proteins, like XRCC3, which are involved in meiotic recombination. However, little is known about the functional interplay between these proteins during meiosis. We investigated the functional relationship between AtMND1, AtDMC1, AtRAD51, and AtXRCC3 during meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate the localization of AtMND1 to meiotic chromosomes, even in the absence of recombination, and show that AtMND1 loading depends exclusively on AHP2, the Arabidopsis Hop2 homolog. We provide evidence of genetic interaction between AtMND1, AtDMC1, AtRAD51, and AtXRCC3. In vitro assays suggest that this functional link is due to direct interaction of the AtMND1-AHP2 complex with AtRAD51 and AtDMC1. We show that AtDMC1 foci accumulate in the Atmnd1 mutant, but are reduced in number in Atrad51 and Atxrcc3 mutants. This study provides the first insights into the functional differences of AtRAD51 and AtXRCC3 during meiosis, demonstrating that AtXRCC3 is dispensable for AtDMC1 focus formation in an Atmnd1 mutant background, whereas AtRAD51 is not. These results clarify the functional interactions between key players in the strand exchange processes during meiotic recombination. Furthermore, they highlight a direct interaction between MND1 and RAD51 and show a functional divergence between RAD51 and XRCC3."

Biol.,101186374,2007,prp8 mutations that cause human retinitis pigmentosa lead to a U5 snRNP maturation defect in yeast.,"Prp8 protein (Prp8p) is a highly conserved pre-mRNA splicing factor and a component of spliceosomal U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Although it is ubiquitously expressed, mutations in the C terminus of human Prp8p cause the retina-specific disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The biogenesis of U5 snRNPs is poorly characterized. We present evidence for a cytoplasmic precursor U5 snRNP in yeast that lacks the mature U5 snRNP component Brr2p and depends on a nuclear localization signal in Prp8p for its efficient nuclear import. The association of Brr2p with the U5 snRNP occurs within the nucleus. RP mutations in Prp8p in yeast result in nuclear accumulation of the precursor U5 snRNP, apparently as a consequence of disrupting the interaction of Prp8p with Brr2p. We therefore propose a novel assembly pathway for U5 snRNP complexes that is disrupted by mutations that cause human RP."

Cell Proteomics,101125647,2008,The in vivo brain interactome of the amyloid precursor protein.,"Despite intense research efforts, the physiological function and molecular environment of the amyloid precursor protein has remained enigmatic. Here we describe the application of time-controlled transcardiac perfusion cross-linking, a method for the in vivo mapping of protein interactions in intact tissue, to study the interactome of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). To gain insights into the specificity of reported protein interactions the study was extended to the mammalian amyloid precursor-like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2). To rule out sampling bias as an explanation for differences in the individual datasets, a small scale quantitative iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation)-based comparison of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 interactomes was carried out. An interactome map was derived that confirmed eight previously reported interactions of APP and revealed the identity of more than 30 additional proteins that reside in spatial proximity to APP in the brain. Subsequent validation studies confirmed a physiological interaction between APP and leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain-containing protein 1, demonstrated a strong influence of Ig domain-containing protein 1 on the proteolytic processing of APP, and consolidated similarities in the biology of APP and p75."
19668204,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Structural and functional analyses of methyl-lysine binding by the malignant brain tumour repeat protein Sex comb on midleg.,"Sex comb on midleg (Scm) is a member of the Polycomb group of proteins involved in the maintenance of repression of Hox and other developmental control genes in Drosophila. The two malignant brain tumour (MBT) repeats of Scm form a domain that preferentially binds to monomethylated lysine residues either as a free amino acid or in the context of peptides, while unmodified or di- or trimethylated lysine residues are bound with significantly lower affinity. The crystal structure of a monomethyl-lysine-containing histone tail peptide bound to the MBT repeat domain shows that the methyl-lysine side chain occupies a binding pocket in the second MBT repeat formed by three conserved aromatic residues and one aspartate. Insertion of the monomethylated side chain into this pocket seems to be the main contributor to the binding affinity. Functional analyses in Drosophila show that the MBT domain of Scm and its methyl-lysine-binding activity are required for repression of Hox genes."
19668229,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Vinculin binding in its closed conformation by a helix addition mechanism.,"Vinculin links integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton by binding to talin. Vinculin is held in an inactive, closed-clamp conformation through hydrophobic interactions between its head and tail domains, and vinculin activation has long been thought to be dependent upon severing the head-tail interaction. Talin, alpha-actinin, and the invasin IpaA of Shigella flexneri sever vinculin's head-tail interaction by inserting an alpha-helix into vinculin's N-terminal four-helical bundle, provoking extensive conformational changes by a helical bundle conversion mechanism; these alterations in vinculin structure displace its tail domain, allowing vinculin to bind to its other partners. IpaA harbors two juxtaposed alpha-helical vinculin-binding sites (VBS) in its C-terminus. Here, we report that the lower affinity VBS of IpaA can also bind to the adjacent C-terminal four-helical bundle of vinculin's head domain through a helix addition mechanism. These hydrophobic interactions do not alter the conformation of this helical bundle, and the architecture of the complex suggests that IpaA can simultaneously interact with both of the four-helical bundle domains of vinculin's N-terminus to stabilize vinculin-IpaA interactions."
19668263,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The pro-apoptotic kinase Mst1 and its caspase cleavage products are direct inhibitors of Akt1.,"Akt kinases mediate cell growth and survival. Here, we report that a pro-apoptotic kinase, Mst1/STK4, is a physiological Akt1 interaction partner. Mst1 was identified as a component of an Akt1 multiprotein complex isolated from lipid raft-enriched fractions of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Endogenous Mst1, along with its paralog, Mst2, acted as inhibitors of endogenous Akt1. Surprisingly, mature Mst1 as well as both of its caspase cleavage products, which localize to distinct subcellular compartments and are not structurally homologous, complexed with and inhibited Akt1. cRNAs encoding full-length Mst1, and N- and C-terminal caspase Mst1 cleavage products, reverted an early lethal phenotype in zebrafish development induced by expression of membrane-targeted Akt1. Mst1 and Akt1 localized to identical subcellular sites in human prostate tumors. Mst1 levels declined with progression from clinically localized to hormone refractory disease, coinciding with an increase in Akt activation with transition from hormone naïve to hormone-resistant metastases. These results position Mst1/2 within a novel branch of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and suggest an important role in cancer progression."
19668337,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Interaction of tau protein with the dynactin complex.,"Tau is an axonal microtubule-associated protein involved in microtubule assembly and stabilization. Mutations in Tau cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and tau aggregates are present in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. The mechanisms leading from tau dysfunction to neurodegeneration are still debated. The dynein-activator complex dynactin has an essential role in axonal transport and mutations in its gene are associated with lower motor neuron disease. We show here for the first time that the N-terminal projection domain of tau binds to the C-terminus of the p150 subunit of the dynactin complex. Tau and dynactin show extensive colocalization, and the attachment of the dynactin complex to microtubules is enhanced by tau. Mutations of a conserved arginine residue in the N-terminus of tau, found in patients with FTDP-17, affect its binding to dynactin, which is abnormally distributed in the retinal ganglion cell axons of transgenic mice expressing human tau with a mutation in the microtubule-binding domain. These findings, which suggest a direct involvement of tau in axonal transport, have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of tauopathies."

In this study, we report that Cited2 is required for mouse fetal liver development. Cited2(-/-) fetal liver displays hypoplasia with higher incidence of cell apoptosis, and exhibits disrupted cell-cell contact, disorganized sinusoidal architecture, as well as impaired lipid metabolism and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the physical and functional interaction of Cited2 with liver-enriched transcription factor HNF4alpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further confirmed the recruitment of Cited2 onto the HNF4alpha-responsive promoters and the reduced HNF4alpha binding to its target gene promoters in the absence of Cited2. Taken together, this study suggests that fetal liver defects in mice lacking Cited2 result, at least in part, from its defective coactivation function for HNF4alpha."
19671129,0,Biol. Reprod.,207224,2008,Identification and characterization of RHOA-interacting proteins in bovine spermatozoa.,"In somatic cells, RHOA mediates actin dynamics through a GNA13-mediated signaling cascade involving RHO kinase (ROCK), LIM kinase (LIMK), and cofilin. RHOA can be negatively regulated by protein kinase A (PRKA), and it interacts with members of the A-kinase anchoring (AKAP) family via intermediary proteins. In spermatozoa, actin polymerization precedes the acrosome reaction, which is necessary for normal fertility. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the GNA13-mediated RHOA signaling pathway may be involved in acrosome reaction in bovine caudal sperm, and whether AKAPs may be involved in its targeting and regulation. GNA13, RHOA, ROCK2, LIMK2, and cofilin were all detected by Western blot in bovine caudal sperm. Overlay, immunoprecipitation, and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified several RHOA-interacting proteins, including proacrosin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, tubulin, aldolase C, and AKAP4. Using overlay and pulldown techniques, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of AKAP3 increases its interaction with the RHOA-interacting proteins PRKAR2 (the type II regulatory subunit of PRKA, formerly RII) and ropporin (ROPN1, a PRKAR2-like protein, or R2D2). Varying calcium concentrations in pulldown assays did not significantly alter binding to R2D2 proteins. These data suggest that the actin-regulating GNA13-mediated RHOA-ROCK-LIMK-cofilin pathway is present in bovine spermatozoa, that RHOA interacts with proteins involved in capacitation and the acrosome reaction, and that RHOA signaling in sperm may be targeted by AKAPs. Finally, AKAP3 binding to PRKAR2 and ROPN1 is regulated by phosphorylation in vitro."

Cell,9201390,2007,Epidermal growth factor increases the interaction between nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K/poly(C) binding protein 1 complex to regulate the gastrin mRNA turnover.,"Gastrin, a gastrointestinal hormone responsible for gastric acid secretion, has been confirmed as a growth factor for gastrointestinal tract malignancies. High expression of gastrin mRNA was observed in pancreatic and colorectal cancer; however, the mechanism is unclear. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was found to increase gastrin mRNA stability, indicating mRNA turnover regulation mechanism is involved in the control of gastrin mRNA expression. Using biotin-labeled RNA probe pull-down assay combined with mass spectrometry analysis, we identified the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and poly(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) bound with the C-rich region in gastrin mRNA 3' untranslated region. Nucleolin bound with the AGCCCU motif and interacted with hnRNP K were also demonstrated. Under EGF treatment, we observed the amount of nucleolin interacting with hnRNP K and gastrin mRNA increased. Using small interfering RNA technology to define their functional roles, we found hnRNP K, PCBP1, and nucleolin were all responsible for stabilizing gastrin mRNA. Moreover, nucleolin plays a crucial role in mediating the increased gastrin mRNA stability induced by EGF signaling. Besides, we also observed hnRNP K/PCBP1 complex bound with the C-rich region in the gastrin mRNA increased nucleolin binding with gastrin mRNA. Finally, a novel binding model was proposed."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Altered phase diagram due to a single point mutation in human gammaD-crystallin.,"The P23T mutant of human gammaD-crystallin (HGD) is associated with cataract. We have previously investigated the solution properties of this mutant, as well as those of the closely related P23V and P23S mutants, and shown that although mutations at site 23 of HGD do not produce a significant structural change in the protein, they nevertheless profoundly alter the solubility of the protein. Remarkably, the solubility of the mutants decreases with increasing temperature, in sharp contrast to the behavior of the native protein. This inverted solubility corresponds to a strong increase in the binding energy with temperature. Here we have investigated the liquid-liquid coexistence curve and the diffusivity of the P23V mutant and find that these solution properties are unaffected by the mutation. This means that the chemical potentials in the solution phase are essentially unaltered. The apparent discrepancy between the interaction energies in the solution phase, as compared with the solid phase, is explicable in terms of highly anisotropic interprotein interactions, which are averaged out in the solution phase but are fully engaged in the solid phase."

The 2.4 A resolution structure of Sse1 with ATP shows that Hsp110s are indeed Hsp70 relatives, and it provides insight into allosteric coupling between sites for ATP and polypeptide-substrate binding in Hsp70s. Subdomain structures are similar in intact Sse1(ATP) and in the separate Hsp70 domains, but conformational dispositions are radically different. Interfaces between Sse1 domains are extensive, intimate, and conservative in sequence with Hsp70s. We propose that Sse1(ATP) may be an evolutionary vestige of the Hsp70(ATP) state, and an analysis of 64 mutant variants in Sse1 and three Hsp70 homologs supports this hypothesis. An atomic-level understanding of Hsp70 communication between ATP and substrate-binding domains follows. Requirements on Sse1 for yeast viability are in keeping with the distinct function of Hsp110s as nucleotide exchange factors."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Variant estrogen receptor-c-Src molecular interdependence and c-Src structural requirements for endothelial NO synthase activation.,"Little is known about the tyrosine kinase c-Src's function in the systemic circulation, in particular its role in arterial responses to hormonal stimuli. In human aortic and venous endothelial cells, c-Src is indispensable for 17beta-estradiol (E2)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway activation, a possible mechanism in E2-mediated vascular protection. Here we show that c-Src supports basal and E2-stimulated NO production and is required for E2-induced vasorelaxation in murine aortas. Only membrane c-Src is structurally and functionally involved in E2-induced eNOS activation. Independent of c-Src kinase activity, c-Src is associated with an N-terminally truncated estrogen receptor alpha variant (ER46) and eNOS in the plasma membrane through its &quot;open&quot; (substrate-accessible) conformation. In the presence of E2, c-Src kinase is activated by membrane ER46 and in turn phosphorylates ER46 for subsequent ER46 and c-Src membrane recruitment, the assembly of an eNOS-centered membrane macrocomplex, and membrane-initiated eNOS activation. Overall, these results provide insights into a critical role for the tyrosine kinase c-Src in estrogen-stimulated arterial responses, and in membrane-initiated rapid signal transduction, for which obligate complex assembly and localization require the c-Src substrate-accessible structure."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Structural basis for antiactivation in bacterial quorum sensing.,"Bacteria can communicate via diffusible signal molecules they generate and release to coordinate their behavior in response to the environment. Signal molecule concentration is often proportional to bacterial population density, and when this reaches a critical concentration, reflecting a bacterial quorum, specific behaviors including virulence, symbiosis, and horizontal gene transfer are activated. Quorum-sensing regulation in many Gram-negative bacteria involves acylated homoserine lactone signals that are perceived through binding to LuxR-type, acylated-homoserine-lactone-responsive transcription factors. Bacteria of the rhizobial group employ the LuxR-type transcriptional activator TraR in quorum sensing, and its activity is further regulated through interactions with the TraM antiactivator. In this study, we have crystallographically determined the 3D structure of the TraR-TraM antiactivation complex from Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234. Unexpectedly, the antiactivator TraM binds to TraR at a site distinct from its DNA-binding motif and induces an allosteric conformational change in the protein, thereby preventing DNA binding. Structural analysis reveals a highly conserved TraR-TraM interface and suggests a mechanism for antiactivation complex formation. This structure may inform alternative strategies to control quorum-sensing-regulated microbial activity including amelioration of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance. In addition, the structural basis of antiactivation presents a regulatory interaction that provides general insights relevant to the field of transcription regulation and signal transduction."
19673012,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,Force-induced unfolding of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix of living cells.,"Whether mechanically unfolded fibronectin (Fn) is present within native extracellular matrix fibrils is controversial. Fn extensibility under the influence of cell traction forces has been proposed to originate either from the force-induced lengthening of an initially compact, folded quaternary structure as is found in solution (quaternary structure model, where the dimeric arms of Fn cross each other), or from the force-induced unfolding of type III modules (unfolding model). Clarification of this issue is central to our understanding of the structural arrangement of Fn within fibrils, the mechanism of fibrillogenesis, and whether cryptic sites, which are exposed by partial protein unfolding, can be exposed by cell-derived force. In order to differentiate between these two models, two fluorescence resonance energy transfer schemes to label plasma Fn were applied, with sensitivity to either compact-to-extended conformation (arm separation) without loss of secondary structure or compact-to-unfolded conformation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies revealed that a significant fraction of fibrillar Fn within a three-dimensional human fibroblast matrix is partially unfolded. Complete relaxation of Fn fibrils led to a refolding of Fn. The compactly folded quaternary structure with crossed Fn arms, however, was never detected within extracellular matrix fibrils. We conclude that the resting state of Fn fibrils does not contain Fn molecules with crossed-over arms, and that the several-fold extensibility of Fn fibrils involves the unfolding of type III modules. This could imply that Fn might play a significant role in mechanotransduction processes."
19673022,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Clustering and synaptic targeting of PICK1 requires direct interaction between the PDZ domain and lipid membranes.,"Protein interacting with c kinase 1 (PICK1) regulates the trafficking of receptors and ion-channels such as AMPA receptors. Traditionally, the PICK1 PDZ domain is regarded as an adaptor capable of binding to receptors trafficked by PICK1, and the lipid-binding BAR domain functions to tether PICK1 directly to membranes. Here, we show that the PICK1 PDZ domain can directly interact with lipid membranes. The PDZ domain and lipid membrane interaction is mediated by both a polybasic amino-acid cluster and a conserved 'Cys-Pro-Cys' motif located away from the peptide ligand-binding groove. Disruption of the PDZ and lipid membrane interaction totally abolished synaptic targeting of PICK1. Although mutation of the CPC motif did not affect the interaction between PICK1 and AMPA receptors, the mutant PICK1 was unable to cluster the GluR2 subunit of the receptor. In neurons, PICK1 containing the same mutation displayed dramatically compromised capacity in the trafficking of AMPA receptors. Taken together, our findings not only uncovered the novel lipid membrane-binding property of the PICK1 PDZ domain, but also provided direct evidence supporting the functional relevance of the PDZ-lipid interaction."

We have shown that bacterial coculture with intestinal epithelial cells modulates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important signaling intermediates, including beta-catenin and the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha. Ubiquitination of these proteins as well as others is catalyzed by the SCF(betaTrCP) ubiquitin ligase, which itself requires regulated modification of the cullin-1 subunit by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Here we show that epithelia contacted by enteric commensal bacteria in vitro and in vivo rapidly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bacterially induced ROS causes oxidative inactivation of the catalytic cysteine residue of Ubc12, the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme, resulting in complete but transient loss of cullin-1 neddylation and consequent effects on NF-kappaB and beta-catenin signaling. Our results demonstrate that commensal bacteria directly modulate a critical control point of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and suggest how enteric commensal bacterial flora influences the regulatory pathways of the mammalian intestinal epithelia."

Here we investigated the role and regulation of the GTPase-activating enzymes (GAPs) Bem2p and Bem3p for Cdc42p activation and actin polarization at bud emergence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bem2p and Bem3p are localized throughout the cytoplasm and the cell cortex in unbudded G1 cells, but accumulate at sites of polarization after bud emergence. Inactivation of Bem2p results in hyperactivation of Cdc42p and polarization toward multiple sites. Bem2p and Bem3p are hyperphosphorylated at bud emergence most likely by the Cdc28p-Cln2p kinase. This phosphorylation appears to inhibit their GAP activity in vivo, as non-phosphorylatable Bem3p mutants are hyperactive and interfere with Cdc42p activation. Taken together, our results indicate that Bem2p and Bem3p may function as global inhibitors of Cdc42p activation during G1, and their inactivation by the Cdc28p/Cln kinase contributes to site-specific activation of Cdc42p at bud emergence."

Previous studies indicated that the herpes simplex virus type 1 U(L)15 protein (pU(L)15) interacts with the pU(L)28 moiety of a pU(L)28-pU(L)33 complex to form the likely viral terminase. In the current study, a novel temperature-sensitive mutant virus was shown to contain a mutation in U(L)33 codon 61 predicted to change threonine to proline. At the nonpermissive temperature, this virus, designated ts8-22, replicated viral DNA and produced capsids that became enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane but failed to form plaques or to cleave or package viral DNA. Incubation at the nonpermissive temperature also precluded coimmunoprecipitation of U(L)33 protein with its normal interaction partners encoded by U(L)28 and U(L)15 in ts8-22-infected cells and with pU(L)28 in transient-expression assays. Moreover, a temperature-sensitive mutation in U(L)15 precluded coimmunoprecipitation of pU(L)15 with the U(L)28 and U(L)33 proteins at the nonpermissive temperature. We conclude that interactions between putative terminase components are tightly linked to successful viral DNA cleavage and packaging."
19675246,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One of the most abundantly expressed proteins of T. gondii is toxofilin, a monomeric actin-binding protein (ABP) involved in invasion. Toxofilin is found in rhoptry and presents an N-terminal signal sequence, consistent with its being secreted during invasion. We report the structure of toxofilin amino acids 69-196 in complex with the host mammalian actin. Toxofilin presents an extended conformation and interacts with an antiparallel actin dimer, in which one of the actins is related by crystal symmetry. Consistent with this observation, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis shows that toxofilin binds two actins in solution. Toxofilin folds into five consecutive helices, which form three relatively independent actin-binding sites. Helices 1 and 2 bind the symmetry-related actin molecule and cover its nucleotide-binding cleft. Helices 3-5 bind the other actin and constitute the primary actin-binding region. Helix 3 interacts in the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3, a common binding site for most ABPs. Helices 4 and 5 wrap around actin subdomain 4, and residue Gln-134 of helix 4 makes a hydrogen-bonding contact with the nucleotide in actin, both of which are unique features among ABPs. Toxofilin dramatically inhibits nucleotide exchange on two actin molecules simultaneously. This effect is linked to the formation of the antiparallel actin dimer because a construct lacking helices 1 and 2 binds only one actin and inhibits nucleotide exchange less potently."

Here, we present a 2.4-A crystal structure of the VacA p55 domain, which has an important role in mediating VacA binding to host cells. The structure is predominantly a right-handed parallel beta-helix, a feature that is characteristic of autotransporter passenger domains but unique among known bacterial protein toxins. Notable features of VacA p55 include disruptions in beta-sheet contacts that result in five beta-helix subdomains and a C-terminal domain that contains a disulfide bond. Analysis of VacA protein sequences from unrelated H. pylori strains, including m1 and m2 forms of VacA, allows us to identify structural features of the VacA surface that may be important for interactions with host receptors. Docking of the p55 structure into a 19-A cryo-EM map of a VacA dodecamer allows us to propose a model for how VacA monomers assemble into oligomeric structures capable of membrane channel formation."

POT1 (protection of telomeres 1), a class of single-stranded-DNA-binding proteins, is a regulator of telomeric length. The Arabidopsis genome contains three POT1 homologues: POT1A, POT1B and POT1C. Using yeast two-hybrid assays to identify components of a potential POT1A complex, we retrieved three interactors: the N-terminus of the telomerase, a protein kinase and a plant-specific protein. Further analysis of the interaction of POT1 proteins with telomerase showed that this interaction is specific to POT1A, suggesting a specific role for this paralogue. The interaction is specific to the N-terminal region of the telomerase, which can be encoded by splicing variants. This interaction indicates possible mechanisms for telomerase regulation by alternative splicing and by POT1 proteins."

Stability of ICN is tightly regulated by the Sel10-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Sel10 can function as a negative regulator of Notch and exhibits activities of a tumor-suppressor protein. This article shows that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) directly interacts with Sel10 and forms a complex in KSHV-infected cells. This results in suppression of ICN ubiquitination and degradation. The carboxyl terminus of LANA interacts with the F-box and WD40 domains of Sel10 and competes with ICN for binding to Sel10. This elevated level of ICN is also critical for maintaining the enhanced proliferation of KSHV-infected tumor cells. These findings describe a mechanism by which the KSHV-encoded LANA protein regulates ubiquitination of ICN mediated by the F-box component of the E3 ligase Sel10, leading to proliferation of the virus-infected cells."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Chymotryptic specificity determinants in the 1.0 A structure of the zinc-inhibited human tissue kallikrein 7.,"hK7 or human stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme belongs to the human tissue kallikrein (hKs) serine proteinase family and is strongly expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis. It participates in skin desquamation but is also implicated in diverse skin diseases and is a potential biomarker of ovarian cancer. We have solved x-ray structures of recombinant active hK7 at medium and atomic resolution in the presence of the inhibitors succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-chloromethyl ketone and Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethyl ketone. The most distinguishing features of hK7 are the short 70-80 loop and the unique S1 pocket, which prefers P1 Tyr residues, as shown by kinetic data. Similar to several other kallikreins, the enzyme activity is inhibited by Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) at low micromolar concentrations. Biochemical analyses of the mutants H99A and H41F confirm that only the metal-binding site at His(99) close to the catalytic triad accounts for the noncompetitive Zn(2+) inhibition type. Additionally, hK7 exhibits large positively charged surface patches, representing putative exosites for prime side substrate recognition."
19679661,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2007,Peroxiredoxin 1 interacts with androgen receptor and enhances its transactivation.,"Although hypoxia is accepted as an important microenvironmental factor influencing tumor progression and treatment response, it is usually regarded as a static global phenomenon. Consequently, less attention is given to the impact of dynamic changes in tumor oxygenation in regulating the behavior of cancer cells. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a critical role in prostate cancer. We previously reported that hypoxia/reoxygenation, an in vitro condition used to mimic an unstable oxygenation climate in a tumor, stimulates AR activation. In the present study, we showed that peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), a member of the peroxiredoxin protein family, acts as a key mediator in this process. We found that the aggressive LN3, C4-2, and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines derived from LNCaP possess constitutively elevated Prx1 compared with parental cells, and display greater AR activation in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Although the cell survival-enhancing property of Prx1 has traditionally been attributed to its antioxidant activity, the reactive oxygen species-scavenging activity of Prx1 was not essential for AR stimulation because Prx1 itself was oxidized and inactivated by hypoxia/reoxygenation. Increased AR transactivation was observed when wild-type Prx1 or mutant Prx1 (C52S) lacking antioxidant activity was introduced into LNCaP cells. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and in vitro pull-down assays corroborated that Prx1 interacts with AR and enhances its transactivation. We also show that Prx1 is capable of sensitizing a ligand-stimulated AR. Based on the above information, we suggest that disrupting the interaction between Prx1 and AR may serve as a fruitful new target in the management of prostate cancer."
19679839,1,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2007,A CDKN2A mutation in familial melanoma that abrogates binding of p16INK4a to CDK4 but not CDK6.,"The CDKN2A locus encodes two distinct proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, both of which are implicated in replicative senescence and tumor suppression in different contexts. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel strain of human diploid fibroblasts (designated Milan HDFs) from an individual who is homozygous for the R24P mutation in p16INK4a. As this mutation occurs in the first exon of INK4a (exon 1alpha), it has no effect on the primary sequence of p14(ARF). Based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the R24P variant is specifically defective for binding to CDK4 but remains able to associate with CDK6. Nevertheless, Milan HDFs behave as if they are p16INK4a deficient, in terms of sensitivity to spontaneous and oncogene-induced senescence, and the R24P variant has little effect on proliferation when ectopically expressed in normal fibroblasts. It can, however, impair the proliferation of U20S cells, presumably because they express more CDK6 than primary fibroblasts. These observations suggest that CDK4 and CDK6 are not functionally redundant and underscore the importance of CDK4 in the development of melanoma."
19680244,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2007,The Ajuba LIM domain protein is a corepressor for SNAG domain mediated repression and participates in nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling.,"The SNAG repression domain is comprised of a highly conserved 21-amino acid sequence, is named for its presence in the Snail/growth factor independence-1 class of zinc finger transcription factors, and is present in a variety of proto-oncogenic transcription factors and developmental regulators. The prototype SNAG domain containing oncogene, growth factor independence-1, is responsible for the development of T cell thymomas. The SNAIL proteins also encode the SNAG domain and play key roles in epithelial mesenchymal differentiation events during development and metastasis. Significantly, these oncogenic functions require a functional SNAG domain. The molecular mechanisms of SNAG domain-mediated transcriptional repression are largely unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy, we identified Ajuba, a multiple LIM domain protein that can function as a corepressor for the SNAG domain. Ajuba interacts with the SNAG domain in vitro and in vivo, colocalizes with it, and enhances SNAG-mediated transcriptional repression. Ajuba shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and may form a novel intracellular signaling system. Using an integrated reporter gene combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation, we observed rapid, SNAG-dependent assembly of a multiprotein complex that included Ajuba, SNAG, and histone modifications consistent with the repressed state. Thus, SNAG domain proteins may bind Ajuba, trapping it in the nucleus where it functions as an adapter or molecular scaffold for the assembly of macromolecular repression complexes at target promoters."
19680266,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,AKAP complex regulates Ca2+ re-uptake into heart sarcoplasmic reticulum.,"The beta-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway regulates heart rate and contractility. Here, we identified a supramolecular complex consisting of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), its negative regulator phospholamban (PLN), the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP18delta and PKA. We show that AKAP18delta acts as a scaffold that coordinates PKA phosphorylation of PLN and the adrenergic effect on Ca(2+) re-uptake. Inhibition of the compartmentalization of this cAMP signalling complex by specific molecular disruptors interferes with the phosphorylation of PLN. This prevents the subsequent release of PLN from SERCA2, thereby affecting the Ca(2+) re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum induced by adrenergic stimuli."
19680286,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,A protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation network regulates a plant potassium channel.,"Potassium (K(+)) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. Plants often adapt to low K(+) conditions by increasing their K(+) uptake capability. Recent studies have led to the identification of a calcium signaling pathway that enables plants to act in this capacity. Calcium is linked to two calcineurin B-like calcium sensors (CBLs) and a target kinase (CBL-interacting protein kinase 23 or CIPK23) that, in turn, appears to phosphorylate and activate the potassium channel, Arabidopsis K(+) transporter 1 (AKT1), responsible for K(+) uptake in roots. Here, we report evidence that this regulatory mechanism is more elaborate than earlier envisaged. The recently described pathway is part of an extensive network whereby several CBLs interact with multiple CIPKs in the activation of the potassium channel, AKT1. The physical interactions among the CBL, CIPK, and AKT1 components provide a mechanism for specifying the members of the CBL and CIPK families functional in AKT1 regulation. The interaction between the CIPKs and AKT1 was found to involve the kinase domain of the CIPK component and the ankyrin repeat domain of the channel. Furthermore, we identified a 2C-type protein phosphatase that physically interacts and inactivates the AKT1 channel. These findings provide evidence that the calcium-sensitive CBL and CIPK families together with 2C-type protein phosphatases form a protein phoshporylation/dephosphorylation network that regulates the AKT1 channel for K(+) transport in plants."
19680557,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,"Amplitude control of protein kinase C by RINCK, a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase.","Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes play a central role in cellular signaling. Levels of PKC control the amplitude of agonist-induced signaling and alterations in these levels are associated with disease states, most notably cancer, yet mechanisms that control the turnover of the protein are poorly understood. Here we identify an E3 ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PKC. Specifically, we identified a RING finger domain-containing protein, RINCK (for RING-finger protein that interacts with C kinase) from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the amino terminus of PKCbeta as bait. RINCK encodes a protein of 581 amino acids that contains a RING finger domain, a B-box, and two coiled-coil regions, the three domains that form the signature motif of the large family of diverse TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using tsA201 cells reveal that RINCK and PKC associate with each other in cells. Studies using fragments of PKCbeta reveal that this interaction is mediated by the C1A domain of PKC. RINCK induces the ubiquitination of PKC both in vitro and in cells. Overexpression of RINCK reduces the levels of PKC in cells, whereas genetic knockdown of endogenous RINCK increases the levels of PKC. This increase was observed for all PKC isozymes examined (including conventional, novel, and atypical). The RINCK-mediated degradation of PKC occurs independently of the classic phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation: genetic depletion of RINCK had no effect on the phorbol ester-mediated down-regulation and, additionally, up-regulated the levels of isozymes that cannot bind phorbol esters. Our data reveal a novel mechanism that provides amplitude control in PKC signaling through ubiquitination catalyzed by RINCK, an E3 ligase that specifically recognizes the C1 domain of PKC isoforms."
19682206,0,Cell,413066,2007,Elucidation of a universal size-control mechanism in Drosophila and mammals.,"Coordination of cell proliferation and cell death is essential to attain proper organ size during development and for maintaining tissue homeostasis throughout postnatal life. In Drosophila, these two processes are orchestrated by the Hippo kinase cascade, a growth-suppressive pathway that ultimately antagonizes the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here we demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site in Yki mediates the growth-suppressive output of the Hippo pathway. Hippo-mediated phosphorylation inactivates Yki by excluding it from the nucleus, whereas loss of Hippo signaling leads to nuclear accumulation and therefore increased Yki activity. We further delineate a mammalian Hippo signaling pathway that culminates in the phosphorylation of YAP, the mammalian homolog of Yki. Using a conditional YAP transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the mammalian Hippo pathway is a potent regulator of organ size, and that its dysregulation leads to tumorigenesis. These results uncover a universal size-control mechanism in metazoan."
19682380,0,Cell,413066,2007,An intracellular serpin regulates necrosis by inhibiting the induction and sequelae of lysosomal injury.,"Extracellular serpins such as antithrombin and alpha1-antitrypsin are the quintessential regulators of proteolytic pathways. In contrast, the biological functions of the intracellular serpins remain obscure. We now report that the C. elegans intracellular serpin, SRP-6, exhibits a prosurvival function by blocking necrosis. Minutes after hypotonic shock, srp-6 null animals underwent a catastrophic series of events culminating in lysosomal disruption, cytoplasmic proteolysis, and death. This newly defined hypo-osmotic stress lethal (Osl) phenotype was dependent upon calpains and lysosomal cysteine peptidases, two in vitro targets of SRP-6. By protecting against both the induction of and the lethal effects from lysosomal injury, SRP-6 also blocked death induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and cation channel hyperactivity. These findings suggest that multiple noxious stimuli converge upon a peptidase-driven, core stress response pathway that, in the absence of serpin regulation, triggers a lysosomal-dependent necrotic cell death routine."
19682432,0,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2008,Characterization of the interaction between the human DNA topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) and the cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45) protein.,"TopBP1 (topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1) is a BRCT [BRCA1 (breast-cancer susceptibility gene 1) C-terminal]-domain-rich protein that is structurally and functionally conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms. It is required for the initiation of DNA replication and for DNA repair and DNA damage signalling. Experiments with fission yeast and Xenopus revealed that the TopBP1 homologues of these organisms are required for chromatin loading of the replication protein Cdc45 (cell division cycle 45). To improve our understanding of the physiological functions of human TopBP1, we investigated the interplay between human TopBP1 and Cdc45 proteins in synchronized HeLa-S3 cells. Using GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we showed a direct interaction between TopBP1 and Cdc45 in vitro and in vivo. The use of deletion mutants in GST pull-down assays identified the first and second as well as the sixth BRCT domains of TopBP1 to be responsible for the functional interaction with Cdc45. Moreover, the interaction between Cdc45 and the first and second BRCT domains of TopBP1 inhibited their transcriptional activation both in yeast and mammalian one-hybrid systems. Both proteins interacted exclusively at the G(1)/S boundary of cell cycle; only weak interaction could be found at the G(2)/M boundary. The overexpression of the sixth BRCT domain led to diminished loading of Cdc45 on to chromatin. These results suggest that human TopBP1 is involved in the formation of the initiation complex of replication in human cells and is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication."
19682929,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Requirement for O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in lymphocytes activation.,"The dynamic modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins with O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) by the O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) is a regulatory post-translational modification that is responsive to various stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that OGT is a central factor for T- and B-lymphocytes activation. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of OGT in T cells leads to an impaired activation of the transcription factors NFAT and NFkappaB. This results in a reduction of IL-2 production consistent with prevention of T-cell activation. OGT is also required for the early activation of B cells mediated by stimulation of the B-cell receptor. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NFkappaB as well as NFAT are glycosylated with O-GlcNAc after direct binding to OGT. Moreover, kinetic experiments show that O-GlcNAc modification prominently increased shortly after activation of lymphoid cells and it might be required for nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NFAT."
19683491,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Insights into histone code syntax from structural and biochemical studies of CARM1 methyltransferase.,"Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (CARM1) is a transcriptional coactivator that methylates Arg17 and Arg26 in histone H3. CARM1 contains a conserved protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) catalytic core flanked by unique pre- and post-core regions. The crystal structures of the CARM1 catalytic core in the apo and holo states reveal cofactor-dependent formation of a substrate-binding groove providing a specific access channel for arginine to the active site. The groove is supported by the first eight residues of the post-core region (C-extension), not present in other PRMTs. In vitro methylation assays show that the C-extension is essential for all histone H3 methylation activity, whereas the pre-core region is required for methylation of Arg26, but not Arg17. Kinetic analysis shows Arg17 methylation is potentiated by pre-acetylation of Lys18, and this is reflected in k(cat) rather than K(m). Together with the absence of specificity subsites in the structure, this suggests an electrostatic sensing mechanism for communicating the modification status of vicinal residues as part of the syntax of the 'histone code.'"
19683510,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Coa1 links the Mss51 post-translational function to Cox1 cofactor insertion in cytochrome c oxidase assembly.,"The assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in yeast mitochondria is shown to be dependent on a new assembly factor designated Coa1 that associates with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Translation of the mitochondrial-encoded subunits of CcO occurs normally in coa1Delta cells, but these subunits fail to accumulate. The respiratory defect in coa1Delta cells is suppressed by high-copy MSS51, MDJ1 and COX10. Mss51 functions in Cox1 translation and elongation, whereas Cox10 participates in the biosynthesis of heme a, a key cofactor of CcO. Respiration in coa1Delta and shy1Delta cells is enhanced when Mss51 and Cox10 are coexpressed. Shy1 has been implicated in formation of the heme a3-Cu(B) site in Cox1. The interaction between Coa1 and Cox1, and the physical and genetic interactions between Coa1 and Mss51, Shy1 and Cox14 suggest that Coa1 coordinates the transition of newly synthesized Cox1 from the Mss51:Cox14 complex to the heme a cofactor insertion involving Shy1. coa1Delta cells also display a mitochondrial copper defect suggesting that Coa1 may have a direct link to copper metallation of CcO."
19683538,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Shy1 couples Cox1 translational regulation to cytochrome c oxidase assembly.,"Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) of the respiratory chain is assembled from nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded subunits. Defects in the assembly process lead to severe human disorders such as Leigh syndrome. Shy1 is an assembly factor for complex IV in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mutations of its human homolog, SURF1, are the most frequent cause for Leigh syndrome. We report that Shy1 promotes complex IV biogenesis through association with different protein modules; Shy1 interacts with Mss51 and Cox14, translational regulators of Cox1. Additionally, Shy1 associates with the subcomplexes of complex IV that are potential assembly intermediates. Formation of these subcomplexes depends on Coa1 (YIL157c), a novel assembly factor that cooperates with Shy1. Moreover, partially assembled forms of complex IV bound to Shy1 and Cox14 can associate with the bc1 complex to form transitional supercomplexes. We suggest that Shy1 links Cox1 translational regulation to complex IV assembly and supercomplex formation."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Control of Emi2 activity and stability through Mos-mediated recruitment of PP2A.,"Before fertilization, vertebrate eggs are arrested in meiosis II by cytostatic factor (CSF), which holds the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in an inactive state. It was recently reported that Mos, an integral component of CSF, acts in part by promoting the Rsk-mediated phosphorylation of the APC inhibitor Emi2/Erp1. We report here that Rsk phosphorylation of Emi2 promotes its interaction with the protein phosphatase PP2A. Emi2 residues adjacent to the Rsk phosphorylation site were important for PP2A binding. An Emi2 mutant that retained Rsk phosphorylation but lacked PP2A binding could not be modulated by Mos. PP2A bound to Emi2 acted on two distinct clusters of sites phosphorylated by Cdc2, one responsible for modulating its stability during CSF arrest and one that controls binding to the APC. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for Mos action in promoting CSF arrest and also define an unusual mechanism, whereby protein phosphorylation recruits a phosphatase for dephosphorylation of distinct sites phosphorylated by another kinase."
19684141,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,A ubiquitin ligase complex regulates caspase activation during sperm differentiation in Drosophila.,"In both insects and mammals, spermatids eliminate their bulk cytoplasm as they undergo terminal differentiation. In Drosophila, this process of dramatic cellular remodeling requires apoptotic proteins, including caspases. To gain further insight into the regulation of caspases, we screened a large collection of sterile male flies for mutants that block effector caspase activation at the onset of spermatid individualization. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a testis-specific, Cullin-3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex that is required for caspase activation in spermatids. Mutations in either a testis-specific isoform of Cullin-3 (Cul3(Testis)), the small RING protein Roc1b, or a Drosophila orthologue of the mammalian BTB-Kelch protein Klhl10 all reduce or eliminate effector caspase activation in spermatids. Importantly, all three genes encode proteins that can physically interact to form a ubiquitin ligase complex. Roc1b binds to the catalytic core of Cullin-3, and Klhl10 binds specifically to a unique testis-specific N-terminal Cullin-3 (TeNC) domain of Cul3(Testis) that is required for activation of effector caspase in spermatids. Finally, the BIR domain region of the giant inhibitor of apoptosis-like protein dBruce is sufficient to bind to Klhl10, which is consistent with the idea that dBruce is a substrate for the Cullin-3-based E3-ligase complex. These findings reveal a novel role of Cullin-based ubiquitin ligases in caspase regulation."
19684597,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2007,SOS2 promotes salt tolerance in part by interacting with the vacuolar H+-ATPase and upregulating its transport activity.,"The salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is critical for plant salt stress tolerance and has a key role in regulating ion transport under salt stress. To further investigate salt tolerance factors regulated by the SOS pathway, we expressed an N-terminal fusion of the improved tandem affinity purification tag to SOS2 (NTAP-SOS2) in sos2-2 mutant plants. Expression of NTAP-SOS2 rescued the salt tolerance defect of sos2-2 plants, indicating that the fusion protein was functional in vivo. Tandem affinity purification of NTAP-SOS2-containing protein complexes and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated that subunits A, B, C, E, and G of the peripheral cytoplasmic domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) were present in a SOS2-containing protein complex. Parallel purification of samples from control and salt-stressed NTAP-SOS2/sos2-2 plants demonstrated that each of these V-ATPase subunits was more abundant in NTAP-SOS2 complexes isolated from salt-stressed plants, suggesting that the interaction may be enhanced by salt stress. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that SOS2 interacted directly with V-ATPase regulatory subunits B1 and B2. The importance of the SOS2 interaction with the V-ATPase was shown at the cellular level by reduced H+ transport activity of tonoplast vesicles isolated from sos2-2 cells relative to vesicles from wild-type cells. In addition, seedlings of the det3 mutant, which has reduced V-ATPase activity, were found to be severely salt sensitive. Our results suggest that regulation of V-ATPase activity is an additional key function of SOS2 in coordinating changes in ion transport during salt stress and in promoting salt tolerance."
19684852,0,Cancer Res.,2984705R,2007,Efficient p53 activation and apoptosis by simultaneous disruption of binding to MDM2 and MDMX.,"The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in protection against malignant transformation. MDM2 and MDMX are important regulators of the transcriptional activity and stability of p53 by binding to its NH(2) terminus. Recent studies suggest that inhibition of both MDM2 and MDMX is necessary for robust activation of p53 in certain tumor cells. However, small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors such as Nutlin fail to inhibit MDMX despite significant homology between the two proteins. The therapeutic efficacy of such compounds may be compromised by MDMX overexpression. To evaluate the feasibility and biological effects of simultaneously disrupting p53 binding to MDM2 and MDMX, we used phage display to identify a novel peptide that can inhibit p53 interactions with MDM2 (IC(50) = 10 nmol/L) and MDMX (IC(50) = 100 nmol/L). Expression of a scaffold protein (thioredoxin) displaying this peptide sequence by adenovirus disrupts both MDM2 and MDMX interaction with p53, resulting in efficient p53 activation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of tumor cells overexpressing MDM2 and MDMX. Intratumoral injection of the adenovirus also induces growth suppression of tumor xenografts in mice in a p53-dependent fashion. These results show the therapeutic potential of targeting both MDM2 and MDMX in cancer, and provide a novel structural motif for the design of potent p53 activators."

PGI is a multifunctional dimeric protein that extracellularly acts as a cytokine [autocrine motility factor (AMF)] eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, and differentiation functions through binding to its cell surface receptor gp78/AMF receptor (AMFR). AMFR contains a seven-transmembrane domain with RING-H2 and leucine zipper motifs showing ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) activity and is exposed on the endoplasmic reticulum surface. Augmented expressions of both PGI/AMF and AMFR have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, and an intracellular binding partner of PGI/AMF is expected to regulate in part its diverse biological functions. Thus, we screened a cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system to search for interacting protein(s) and report on the finding of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-14 (PARP-14) to be a binding partner with PGI/AMF. PARP-14-PGI/AMF interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization. We also report that PGI/AMF degradation is mainly regulated by the ubiquitin-lysosome system and RNA interference experiments revealed that PARP-14 inhibits PGI/AMF ubiquitination, thus contributing to its stabilization and secretion. This newly characterized PARP-14 protein should assist in understanding the regulation of PGI/AMF intracellular function(s) and may provide a new therapeutic target for inhibition of PGI/AMF inducing tumor cell migration and invasion during metastasis."
19686638,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,The Arabidopsis BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN proteins SAW1 and SAW2 act redundantly to regulate KNOX expression spatially in leaf margins.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana, the BEL1-like TALE homeodomain protein family consists of 13 members that form heterodimeric complexes with the Class 1 KNOX TALE homeodomain proteins, including SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP). The BEL1-like protein BELLRINGER (BLR) functions together with STM and BP in the shoot apex to regulate meristem identity and function and to promote correct shoot architecture. We have characterized two additional BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN (BLH) proteins, SAWTOOTH1 (BLH2/SAW1) and SAWTOOTH2 (BLH4/SAW2) that, in contrast with BLR, are expressed in lateral organs and negatively regulate BP expression. saw1 and saw2 single mutants have no obvious phenotype, but the saw1 saw2 double mutant has increased leaf serrations and revolute margins, indicating that SAW1 and SAW2 act redundantly to limit leaf margin growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of SAW1 suppresses overall growth of the plant shoot. BP is ectopically expressed in the leaf serrations of saw1 saw2 double mutants. Ectopic expression of Class 1 KNOX genes in leaves has been observed previously in loss-of-function mutants of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES (AS1). Overexpression of SAW1 in an as1 mutant suppresses the as1 leaf phenotype and reduces ectopic BP leaf expression. Taken together, our data suggest that BLH2/SAW1 and BLH4/SAW2 establish leaf shape by repressing growth in specific subdomains of the leaf at least in part by repressing expression of one or more of the KNOX genes."
19686675,0,Science,404511,2007,FKF1 and GIGANTEA complex formation is required for day-length measurement in Arabidopsis.,"Precise timing of CONSTANS (CO) gene expression is necessary for day-length discrimination for photoperiodic flowering. The FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), and GIGANTEA (GI) proteins regulate CO transcription in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that FKF1 and GI proteins form a complex in a blue-light-dependent manner. The timing of this interaction regulates the timing of daytime CO expression. FKF1 function is dependent on GI, which interacts with a CO repressor, CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1), and controls CDF1 stability. GI, FKF1, and CDF1 proteins associate with CO chromatin. Thus, the FKF1-GI complex forms on the CO promoter in late afternoon to regulate CO expression, providing a mechanistic view of how the coincidence of light with circadian timing regulates photoperiodic flowering."
19686679,1,J. Virol.,113724,2007,Dynamic interactions of the UL16 tegument protein with the capsid of herpes simplex virus.,"The UL16 tegument protein of herpes simplex virus is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family. It has been reported to be capsid associated and may be involved in budding by providing an interaction with the membrane-bound UL11 protein. UL16 has been shown to be present in all the major locations that capsids are found (i.e., the nucleus, cytoplasm, and virions), but whether it is actually capsid associated in each of these has not been reported. Therefore, capsids were purified from each compartment, and it was found that UL16 was present on cytoplasmic but not nuclear capsids. In extracellular virions, the majority of UL16 (87%) was once again not capsid associated, which suggests that the interaction is transient during egress. Because herpes simplex virus (HSV) buds into the acidic compartment of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the effect of pH on the interaction was examined. The amount of capsid-associated UL16 dramatically increased when extracellular virions were exposed to mildly acidic medium (pH 5.0 to 5.5), and this association was fully reversible. After budding into the TGN, capsid and tegument proteins also encounter an oxidizing environment, which is conducive to disulfide bond formation. UL16 contains 20 cysteines, including five that are conserved within a putative zinc finger. Any free cysteines that are involved in the capsid interaction or release mechanism of UL16 would be expected to be modified by N-ethylmaleimide, and, consistent with this, the amount of capsid-associated UL16 dramatically increased when virions were incubated with this compound. Taken together, these data suggest a transient interaction between UL16 and capsids, possibly modified in the acidic compartment of secretory vesicles and requiring a release mechanism that involves cysteines."

We have identified three closely related genes, HECATE1 (HEC1), HECATE2 (HEC2) and HECATE3 (HEC3), the expression domains of which encompass these regions of the Arabidopsis gynoecium. The HEC genes encode putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with overlapping functionality. Depending on the amount of HEC function missing, plants exhibit varying degrees of infertility, defects in septum, transmitting tract and stigma development and impaired pollen tube growth. The observed phenotypes are similar to those reported for mutations in the SPATULA (SPT) gene, which also encodes a bHLH transcription factor required for development of the same female tissues. We show that the HEC proteins can dimerize with SPT in a yeast two-hybrid system, indicating that the HEC genes work in concert with SPT to coordinately regulate development of the female reproductive tract. Furthermore, when the HEC genes are ectopically expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter, some of the resulting transgenic plants show pin-shaped inflorescences, suggesting that the HEC genes are probably involved in auxin-mediated control of gynoecium patterning."
19687297,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,"Identification of a novel inhibitor of differentiation-1 (ID-1) binding partner, caveolin-1, and its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.","Recently, ID-1 (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding) is suggested as an oncogene and is reported to promote cell proliferation, invasion, and survival in several types of human cancer cells through multiple signaling pathways. However, how Id-1 interacts with these pathways and the immediate downstream effectors of the Id-1 protein are not known. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid screening technique, we identified a novel Id-1-interacting protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a cell membrane protein, and a positive regulator of cell survival and metastasis in prostate cancer. Using an immunoprecipitation method, we found that the helix-loop-helix domain of the Id-1 protein was essential for the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1. In addition, we also demonstrated that the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1 played a key role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased cell migration rate as well as resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, our results revealed that this effect was regulated by Id-1-induced Akt activation through promoting the binding activity between Cav-1 and protein phosphatase 2A. Our study demonstrates a novel Id-1 binding partner and suggests a molecular mechanism that mediates the function of Id-1 in promoting prostate cancer progression through activation of the Akt pathway leading to cancer cell invasion and resistance to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis."
19687302,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Activation of the Cdc42p GTPase by cyclin-dependent protein kinases in budding yeast.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) trigger essential cell cycle processes including critical events in G1 phase that culminate in bud emergence, spindle pole body duplication, and DNA replication. Localized activation of the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42p is crucial for establishment of cell polarity during G1, but CDK targets that link the Cdc42p module with cell growth and cell cycle commitment have remained largely elusive. Here, we identify the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Rga2p as an important substrate related to the cell polarity function of G1 CDKs. Overexpression of RGA2 in the absence of functional Pho85p or Cdc28p CDK complexes is toxic, due to an inability to polarize growth. Mutation of CDK consensus sites in Rga2p that are phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by Pho85p and Cdc28p CDKs results in a loss of G1 phase-specific phosphorylation. A failure to phosphorylate Rga2p leads to defects in localization and impaired polarized growth, in a manner dependent on Rga2p GAP function. Taken together, our data suggest that CDK-dependent phosphorylation restrains Rga2p activity to ensure appropriate activation of Cdc42p during cell polarity establishment. Inhibition of GAPs by CDK phosphorylation may be a general mechanism to promote proper G1-phase progression."
19687802,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Human ESCRT and ALIX proteins interact with proteins of the midbody and function in cytokinesis.,"TSG101 and ALIX both function in HIV budding and in vesicle formation at the multivesicular body (MVB), where they interact with other Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway factors required for release of viruses and vesicles. Proteomic analyses revealed that ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I also bind a series of proteins involved in cytokinesis, including CEP55, CD2AP, ROCK1, and IQGAP1. ALIX and TSG101 concentrate at centrosomes and are then recruited to the midbodies of dividing cells through direct interactions between the central CEP55 'hinge' region and GPP-based motifs within TSG101 and ALIX. ESCRT-III and VPS4 proteins are also recruited, indicating that much of the ESCRT pathway localizes to the midbody. Depletion of ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I inhibits the abscission step of HeLa cell cytokinesis, as does VPS4 overexpression, confirming a requirement for these proteins in cell division. Furthermore, ALIX point mutants that block CEP55 and CHMP4/ESCRT-III binding also inhibit abscission, indicating that both interactions are essential. These experiments suggest that the ESCRT pathway may be recruited to facilitate analogous membrane fission events during HIV budding, MVB vesicle formation, and the abscission stage of cytokinesis."
19688093,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Direct stimulation of receptor-controlled phospholipase D1 by phospho-cofilin.,"The activity state of cofilin, which controls actin dynamics, is driven by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinases results in its inactivation, a process supported by 14-3-3zeta and reversed by dephosphorylation by slingshot phosphatases. Here we report on a novel cellular function for the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of cofilin. We demonstrate that muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is controlled by LIM-kinase, slingshot phosphatase as well as 14-3-3zeta, and requires phosphorylatable cofilin. Cofilin directly and specifically interacts with PLD1 and upon phosphorylation by LIM-kinase1, stimulates PLD1 activity, an effect mimicked by phosphorylation-mimic cofilin mutants. The interaction of cofilin with PLD1 is under receptor control and encompasses a PLD1-specific fragment (aa 585-712). Expression of this fragment suppresses receptor-induced cofilin-PLD1 interaction as well as PLD stimulation and actin stress fiber formation. These data indicate that till now designated inactive phospho-cofilin exhibits an active cellular function, and suggest that phospho-cofilin by its stimulatory effect on PLD1 may control a large variety of cellular functions."
19688094,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Regulation of nicotinic receptor trafficking by the transmembrane Golgi protein UNC-50.,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). After assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), AChRs must be transported to the plasma membrane through the secretory apparatus. Little is known about specific molecules that mediate this transport. Here we identify a gene that is required for subtype-specific trafficking of assembled nicotinic AChRs in Caenorhabditis elegans. unc-50 encodes an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein that localizes to the Golgi apparatus. In the absence of UNC-50, a subset of AChRs present in body-wall muscle are sorted to the lysosomal system and degraded. However, the trafficking of a second AChR type and of GABA ionotropic receptors expressed in the same muscle cells is not affected in unc-50 mutants. These results suggest that, in addition to ER quality control, assembled AChRs are sorted within the Golgi system by a mechanism that controls the amount of cell-surface AChRs in a subtype-specific way."
19688748,0,Structure,101087697,2007,The structure of the prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-modulated potassium channel MloK1 at 16 A resolution.,"The gating ring of cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels is proposed to be either a two-fold symmetric dimer of dimers or a four-fold symmetric tetramer based on high-resolution structure data of soluble cyclic nucleotide-binding domains and functional data on intact channels. We addressed this controversy by obtaining structural data on an intact, full-length, cyclic nucleotide-modulated potassium channel, MloK1, from Mesorhizobium loti, which also features a putative voltage-sensor. We present here the 3D single-particle structure by transmission electron microscopy and the projection map of membrane-reconstituted 2D crystals of MloK1 in the presence of cAMP. Our data show a four-fold symmetric arrangement of the CNBDs, separated by discrete gaps. A homology model for full-length MloK1 suggests a vertical orientation for the CNBDs. The 2D crystal packing in the membrane-embedded state is compatible with the S1-S4 domains in the vertical &quot;up&quot; state."
19690145,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,BDCA2/Fc epsilon RI gamma complex signals through a novel BCR-like pathway in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells.,"Dendritic cells are equipped with lectin receptors to sense the extracellular environment and modulate cellular responses. Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) uniquely express blood dendritic cell antigen 2 (BDCA2) protein, a C-type lectin lacking an identifiable signaling motif. We demonstrate here that BDCA2 forms a complex with the transmembrane adapter Fc epsilon RI gamma. Through pathway analysis, we identified a comprehensive signaling machinery in human pDCs, similar to that which operates downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR), which is distinct from the system involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. BDCA2 crosslinking resulted in the activation of the BCR-like cascade, which potently suppressed the ability of pDCs to produce type I interferon and other cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor ligands. Therefore, by associating with Fc epsilon RI gamma, BDCA2 activates a novel BCR-like signaling pathway to regulate the immune functions of pDCs."
19690383,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Sequential steps and checkpoints in the early exocytic compartment during secretory IgM biogenesis.,"The biogenesis of secretory IgM occurs stepwise under stringent quality control, formation of micro(2)L(2) preceding polymerization. How is efficiency of IgM secretion coupled to fidelity? We show here that ERp44, a soluble protein involved in thiol-mediated retention, interacts with ERGIC-53. Binding to this hexameric lectin contributes to ERp44 localization in the ER-golgi intermediate compartment. ERp44 and ERGIC-53 increase during B-lymphocyte differentiation, concomitantly with the onset of IgM polymerization. Both preferentially bind micro(2)L(2) and higher order intermediates. Their overexpression or silencing in non-lymphoid cells promotes or decreases secretion of IgM polymers, respectively. In IgM-secreting B-lymphoma cells, micro chains interact first with BiP and later with ERp44 and ERGIC-53. Our findings suggest that ERGIC-53 provides a platform that receives micro(2)L(2) subunits from the BiP-dependent checkpoint, assisting polymerization. In this process, ERp44 couples thiol-dependent assembly and quality control."
19690548,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The Drosophila insulator proteins CTCF and CP190 link enhancer blocking to body patterning.,"Insulator sequences guide the function of distantly located enhancer elements to the appropriate target genes by blocking inappropriate interactions. In Drosophila, five different insulator binding proteins have been identified, Zw5, BEAF-32, GAGA factor, Su(Hw) and dCTCF. Only dCTCF has a known conserved counterpart in vertebrates. Here we find that the structurally related factors dCTCF and Su(Hw) have distinct binding targets. In contrast, the Su(Hw) interacting factor CP190 largely overlapped with dCTCF binding sites and interacts with dCTCF. Binding of dCTCF to targets requires CP190 in many cases, whereas others are independent of CP190. Analysis of the bithorax complex revealed that six of the borders between the parasegment specific regulatory domains are bound by dCTCF and by CP190 in vivo. dCTCF null mutations affect expression of Abdominal-B, cause pharate lethality and a homeotic phenotype. A short pulse of dCTCF expression during larval development rescues the dCTCF loss of function phenotype. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of dCTCF in fly development and in the regulation of abdominal segmentation."
19690609,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,Down-regulation of NF-kappaB target genes by the AP-1 and STAT complex during the innate immune response in Drosophila.,"The activation of several transcription factors is required for the elimination of infectious pathogens via the innate immune response. The transcription factors NF-kappaB, AP-1, and STAT play major roles in the synthesis of immune effector molecules during innate immune responses. However, the fact that these immune responses can have cytotoxic effects requires their tight regulation to achieve restricted and transient activation, and mis-regulation of the damping process has pathological consequences. Here we show that AP-1 and STAT are themselves the major inhibitors responsible for damping NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation during the innate immune response in Drosophila. As the levels of dAP-1 and Stat92E increase due to continuous immune signaling, they play a repressive role by forming a repressosome complex with the Drosophila HMG protein, Dsp1. The dAP-1-, Stat92E-, and Dsp1-containing complexes replace Relish at the promoters of diverse immune effector genes by binding to evolutionarily conserved cis-elements, and they recruit histone deacetylase to inhibit transcription. Reduction by mutation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 results in hyperactivation of Relish target genes and reduces the viability of bacterially infected flies despite more efficient pathogen clearance. These defects are rescued by reducing the Relish copy number, thus confirming that mis-regulation of Relish, not inadequate activation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 target genes, is responsible for the reduced survival of the mutants. We conclude that an inhibitory effect of AP-1 and STAT on NF-kappaB is required for properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved."
19691824,0,Genes Dev.,8711660,2007,Arabidopsis JACKDAW and MAGPIE zinc finger proteins delimit asymmetric cell division and stabilize tissue boundaries by restricting SHORT-ROOT action.,"In the Arabidopsis root, the SHORT-ROOT transcription factor moves outward to the ground tissue from its site of transcription in the stele and is required for the specification of the endodermis and the stem cell organizing quiescent center cells. In addition, SHORT-ROOT and the downstream transcription factor SCARECROW control an oriented cell division in ground tissue stem cell daughters. Here, we show that the JACKDAW and MAGPIE genes, which encode members of a plant-specific family of zinc finger proteins, act in a SHR-dependent feed-forward loop to regulate the range of action of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW. JACKDAW expression is initiated independent of SHORT-ROOT and regulates the SCARECROW expression domain outside the stele, while MAGPIE expression depends on SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW. We provide evidence that JACKDAW and MAGPIE regulate tissue boundaries and asymmetric cell division and can control SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW activity in a transcriptional and protein interaction network."
19692333,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2007,Interaction of SOS2 with nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 and catalases reveals a point of connection between salt stress and H2O2 signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"SOS2, a class 3 sucrose-nonfermenting 1-related kinase, has emerged as an important mediator of salt stress response and stress signaling through its interactions with proteins involved in membrane transport and in regulation of stress responses. We have identified additional SOS2-interacting proteins that suggest a connection between SOS2 and reactive oxygen signaling. SOS2 was found to interact with the H2O2 signaling protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2) and to inhibit its autophosphorylation activity. A sos2-2 ndpk2 double mutant was more salt sensitive than a sos2-2 single mutant, suggesting that NDPK2 and H2O2 are involved in salt resistance. However, the double mutant did not hyperaccumulate H2O2 in response to salt stress, suggesting that it is altered signaling rather than H2O2 toxicity alone that is responsible for the increased salt sensitivity of the sos2-2 ndpk2 double mutant. SOS2 was also found to interact with catalase 2 (CAT2) and CAT3, further connecting SOS2 to H2O2 metabolism and signaling. The interaction of SOS2 with both NDPK2 and CATs reveals a point of cross talk between salt stress response and other signaling factors including H2O2."
19692348,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,AtPRD1 is required for meiotic double strand break formation in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The initiation of meiotic recombination by the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalysed by the Spo11 protein is strongly evolutionary conserved. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spo11 requires nine other proteins for meiotic DSB formation, but, unlike Spo11, few of these proteins seem to be conserved across kingdoms. In order to investigate this recombination step in higher eukaryotes, we have isolated a new gene, AtPRD1, whose mutation affects meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In Atprd1 mutants, meiotic recombination rates fall dramatically, early recombination markers (e.g., DMC1 foci) are absent, but meiosis progresses until achiasmatic univalents are formed. Besides, Atprd1 mutants suppress DSB repair defects of a large range of meiotic mutants, showing that AtPRD1 is involved in meiotic recombination and is required for meiotic DSB formation. Furthermore, we showed that AtPRD1 and AtSPO11-1 interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that AtPRD1 could be a partner of AtSPO11-1. Moreover, our study reveals similarity between AtPRD1 and the mammalian protein Mei1, suggesting that AtPRD1 could be a Mei1 functional homologue."
19692481,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The NECAP PHear domain increases clathrin accessory protein binding potential.,"AP-2 is a key regulator of the endocytic protein machinery driving clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. One critical function, mediated primarily by the AP-2 alpha-ear, is the recruitment of accessory proteins. NECAPs are alpha-ear-binding proteins that enrich on CCVs. Here, we have solved the structure of the conserved N-terminal region of NECAP 1, revealing a unique module in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfamily, which we named the PHear domain. The PHear domain binds accessory proteins bearing FxDxF motifs, which were previously thought to bind exclusively to the AP-2 alpha-ear. Structural analysis of the PHear domain reveals the molecular surface for FxDxF motif binding, which was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The reciprocal analysis of the FxDxF motif in amphiphysin I identified distinct binding requirements for binding to the alpha-ear and PHear domain. We show that NECAP knockdown compromises transferrin uptake and establish a functional role for NECAPs in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our data uncover a striking convergence of two evolutionarily and structurally distinct modules to recognize a common peptide motif and promote efficient endocytosis."
19692594,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases in genome stability.,"We identify the SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase (STUbL) family of proteins and propose that STUbLs selectively ubiquitinate sumoylated proteins and proteins that contain SUMO-like domains (SLDs). STUbL recruitment to sumoylated/SLD proteins is mediated by tandem SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) within the STUbLs N-terminus. STUbL-mediated ubiquitination maintains sumoylation pathway homeostasis by promoting target protein desumoylation and/or degradation. Thus, STUbLs establish a novel mode of communication between the sumoylation and ubiquitination pathways. STUbLs are evolutionarily conserved and include: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Slx8-Rfp (founding member), Homo sapiens RNF4, Dictyostelium discoideum MIP1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Slx5-Slx8. Cells lacking Slx8-Rfp accumulate sumoylated proteins, display genomic instability, and are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. These phenotypes are suppressed by deletion of the major SUMO ligase Pli1, demonstrating the specificity of STUbLs as regulators of sumoylated proteins. Notably, human RNF4 expression restores SUMO pathway homeostasis in fission yeast lacking Slx8-Rfp, underscoring the evolutionary functional conservation of STUbLs. The DNA repair factor Rad60 and its human homolog NIP45, which contain SLDs, are candidate STUbL targets. Consistently, Rad60 and Slx8-Rfp mutants have similar DNA repair defects."
19692611,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Conserved function of RNF4 family proteins in eukaryotes: targeting a ubiquitin ligase to SUMOylated proteins.,"The function of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-binding proteins is key to understanding how SUMOylation regulates cellular processes. We identified two related Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins, Rfp1 and Rfp2, each having an N-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) and a C-terminal RING-finger domain. Genetic analysis shows that Rfp1 and Rfp2 have redundant functions; together, they are essential for cell growth and genome stability. Mammalian RNF4, an active ubiquitin E3 ligase, is an orthologue of Rfp1/Rfp2. Rfp1 and Rfp2 lack E3 activity but recruit Slx8, an active RING-finger ubiquitin ligase, through a RING-RING interaction, to form a functional E3. RNF4 complements the growth and genomic stability defects of rfp1rfp2, slx8, and rfp1rfp2slx8 mutant cells. Both the Rfp-Slx8 complex and RNF4 specifically ubiquitylate artificial SUMO-containing substrates in vitro in a SUMO binding-dependent manner. SUMOylated proteins accumulate in rfp1rfp2 double-null cells, suggesting that Rfp/Slx8 proteins may promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation of SUMOylated targets. Hence, we describe a family of SIM-containing RING-finger proteins that potentially regulates eukaryotic genome stability through linking SUMO-interaction with ubiquitin conjugation."
19692613,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The EM structure of human DNA polymerase gamma reveals a localized contact between the catalytic and accessory subunits.,"We used electron microscopy to examine the structure of human DNA pol gamma, the heterotrimeric mtDNA replicase implicated in certain mitochondrial diseases and aging models. Separate analysis of negatively stained preparations of the catalytic subunit, pol gammaA, and of the holoenzyme including a dimeric accessory factor, pol gammaB(2), permitted unambiguous identification of the position of the accessory factor within the holoenzyme. The model explains protection of a partial chymotryptic cleavage site after residue L(549) of pol gammaA upon binding of the accessory subunit. This interaction region is near residue 467 of pol gammaA, where a disease-related mutation has been reported to impair binding of the B subunit. One pol gammaB subunit dominates contacts with the catalytic subunit, while the second B subunit is largely exposed to solvent. A model for pol gamma is discussed that considers the effects of known mutations in the accessory subunit and the interaction of the enzyme with DNA."
19692618,0,Mol. Biol. Cell,9201390,2007,PAR-3 and PAR-1 inhibit LET-99 localization to generate a cortical band important for spindle positioning in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.,"The conserved PAR proteins are localized in asymmetric cortical domains and are required for the polarized localization of cell fate determinants in many organisms. In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, LET-99 and G protein signaling act downstream of the PARs to regulate spindle positioning and ensure asymmetric division. PAR-3 and PAR-2 localize LET-99 to a posterior cortical band through an unknown mechanism. Here we report that LET-99 asymmetry depends on cortically localized PAR-1 and PAR-4 but not on cytoplasmic polarity effectors. In par-1 and par-4 embryos, LET-99 accumulates at the entire posterior cortex, but remains at low levels at the anterior cortex occupied by PAR-3. Further, PAR-3 and PAR-1 have graded cortical distributions with the highest levels at the anterior and posterior poles, respectively, and the lowest levels of these proteins correlate with high LET-99 accumulation. These results suggest that PAR-3 and PAR-1 inhibit the localization of LET-99 to generate a band pattern. In addition, PAR-1 kinase activity is required for the inhibition of LET-99 localization, and PAR-1 associates with LET-99. Finally, examination of par-1 embryos suggests that the banded pattern of LET-99 is critical for normal posterior spindle displacement and to prevent spindle misorientation caused by cell shape constraints."
19693009,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,GRASP-1 is a neuronal scaffold protein for the JNK signaling pathway.,"GRASP-1 is a neuronally enriched protein that interacts with the AMPA-type glutamate receptor/GRIP complex. GRASP-1 can be cleaved by Caspase-3 in both normal and ischemic brains although the functional significance of this cleavage remains elusive. We investigated signal transduction pathways that might lie downstream of GRASP-1 and found that GRASP-1 potently activates JNK pathway signaling, with no effect on ERK signaling. Such JNK pathway activating activity requires binding of GRASP-1 to both JNK and the upstream JNK pathway activator MEKK-1. Furthermore, mutations that prevent Caspase 3-cleavage of GRASP-1 dramatically inhibit the JNK pathway activating activity of GRASP-1, suggesting a novel link between Caspase-3 activation and JNK pathway signaling. These results suggest that GRASP-1 serves as a scaffold protein to facilitate MEKK-1 activation of JNK signaling in neurons."

Chem.,2985121R,2007,Stimulation of c-Myc transcriptional activity by vIRF-3 of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with two lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman disease. In PEL, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is present in a latent form expressing only few viral genes. Among them is a viral homologue of cellular interferon regulatory factors, vIRF-3. To study the role of vIRF-3 in PEL lymphomagenesis, we analyzed the interaction of vIRF-3 with cellular proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, we detected the association between vIRF-3 and c-Myc suppressor, MM-1alpha. The vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha interaction was also demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha in PEL-derived cell lines. Overexpression of vIRF-3 enhanced the c-Myc-dependent transcription of the gene cdk4. Addressing the molecular mechanism of the vIRF-3-mediated stimulation, we demonstrated that the association between MM-1alpha and c-Myc was inhibited by vIRF-3. Furthermore, the recruitment of vIRF-3 to the cdk4 promoter and the elevated levels of the histone H3 acetylation suggest the direct involvement of vIRF-3 in the activation of c-Myc-mediated transcription. These findings indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively stimulate c-Myc function in PEL cells and consequently contribute to de-regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation."
19693268,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Rad9 BRCT domain interaction with phosphorylated H2AX regulates the G1 checkpoint in budding yeast.,"Phosphorylation of histone H2A or H2AX is an early and sensitive marker of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells, although mutation of the conserved damage-dependent phosphorylation site is well tolerated. Here, we show that H2A phosphorylation is required for cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage at the G1/S transition in budding yeast. Furthermore, we show that the tandem BRCT domain of Rad9 interacts directly with phosphorylated H2A in vitro and that a rad9 point mutation that abolishes this interaction results in in vivo phenotypes that are similar to those caused by an H2A phosphorylation site mutation. Remarkably, similar checkpoint defects are also caused by a Rad9 Tudor domain mutation that impairs Rad9 chromatin association already in undamaged cells. These findings indicate that constitutive Tudor domain-mediated and damage-specific BRCT domain-phospho-H2A-dependent interactions of Rad9 with chromatin cooperate to establish G1 checkpoint arrest."
19694805,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,New androgen receptor genomic targets show an interaction with the ETS1 transcription factor.,"The androgen receptor (AR) initiates important developmental and oncogenic transcriptional pathways. The AR is known to bind as a homodimer to 15-base pair bipartite palindromic androgen-response elements; however, few direct AR gene targets are known. To identify AR promoter targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with on-chip detection of genomic fragments. We identified 1,532 potential AR-binding sites, including previously known AR gene targets. Many of the new AR target genes show altered expression in prostate cancer. Analysis of sequences underlying AR-binding sites showed that more than 50% of AR-binding sites did not contain the established 15 bp AR-binding element. Unbiased sequence analysis showed 6-bp motifs, which were significantly enriched and were bound directly by the AR in vitro. Binding sequences for the avian erythroblastosis virus E26 homologue (ETS) transcription factor family were also highly enriched, and we uncovered an interaction between the AR and ETS1 at a subset of AR promoter targets."
19694809,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Substrate binding to histone deacetylases as shown by the crystal structure of the HDAC8-substrate complex.,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs)-an enzyme family that deacetylates histones and non-histone proteins-are implicated in human diseases such as cancer, and the first-generation of HDAC inhibitors are now in clinical trials. Here, we report the 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of a catalytically inactive HDAC8 active-site mutant, Tyr306Phe, bound to an acetylated peptidic substrate. The structure clarifies the role of active-site residues in the deacetylation reaction and substrate recognition. Notably, the structure shows the unexpected role of a conserved residue at the active-site rim, Asp 101, in positioning the substrate by directly interacting with the peptidic backbone and imposing a constrained cis-conformation. A similar interaction is observed in a new hydroxamate inhibitor-HDAC8 structure that we also solved. The crucial role of Asp 101 in substrate and inhibitor recognition was confirmed by activity and binding assays of wild-type HDAC8 and Asp101Ala, Tyr306Phe and Asp101Ala/Tyr306Phe mutants."
19694902,1,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Structural insights into the recognition of substrates and activators by the OSR1 kinase.,"The oxidative-stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) and the STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) are key enzymes in a signalling cascade regulating the activity of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporters (NKCCs) in response to osmotic stress. Both kinases have a conserved carboxy-terminal (CCT) domain, which recognizes a unique peptide (Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val) motif present in OSR1- and SPAK-activating kinases (with-no-lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) and WNK4) as well as its substrates (NKCC1 and NKCC2). Here, we describe the structural basis of this recognition event as shown by the crystal structure of the CCT domain of OSR1 in complex with a peptide containing this motif, derived from WNK4. The CCT domain forms a novel protein fold that interacts with the Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val motif through a surface-exposed groove. An intricate web of interactions is observed between the CCT domain and an Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val motif-containing peptide derived from WNK4. Mutational analysis shows that these interactions are required for the CCT domain to bind to WNK1 and NKCC1. The CCT domain structure also shows how phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr residue preceding the Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val motif results in a steric clash, promoting its dissociation from the CCT domain. These results provide the first molecular insight into the mechanism by which the SPAK and OSR1 kinases specifically recognize their upstream activators and downstream substrates."

Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is an ancient mechanoenzyme that uses GTP hydrolysis to power the constriction and division of mitochondria. Although Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation is recognized as an early event in the apoptotic programme, acute regulation of Drp1 activity is poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial phosphorylation site that is conserved in all metazoan Drp1 orthologues. Ser 656 is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and dephosphorylated by calcineurin, and its phosphorylation state is controlled by sympathetic tone, calcium levels and cell viability. Pseudophosphorylation of Drp1 by mutation of Ser 656 to aspartic acid leads to the elongation of mitochondria and confers resistance to various pro-apoptotic insults. Conversely, the constitutively dephosphorylated Ser656Ala mutant Drp1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and increases cell vulnerability. Thus, Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser 656 provides a mechanism for the integration of cAMP and calcium signals in the control of mitochondrial shape, apoptosis and other aspects of mitochondrial function."
19695655,0,Cell,413066,2007,Hzf Determines cell survival upon genotoxic stress by modulating p53 transactivation.,"A critical unresolved issue about the genotoxic stress response is how the resulting activation of the p53 tumor suppressor can lead either to cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair or to apoptosis. We show here that hematopoietic zinc finger (Hzf), a zinc-finger-containing p53 target gene, modulates p53 transactivation functions in an autoregulatory feedback loop. Hzf is induced by p53 and binds to its DNA-binding domain, resulting in preferential transactivation of proarrest p53 target genes over its proapoptotic target genes. Thus, p53 activation results in cell-cycle arrest in Hzf wild-type MEFs, while in Hzf(-/-) MEFs, apoptosis is induced. Exposure of Hzf null mice to ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced apoptosis in several organs, as compared to in wild-type mice. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 transactivation function and suggest that Hzf functions as a key player in regulating cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress."
19695706,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The specificity of SNARE pairing in biological membranes is mediated by both proof-reading and spatial segregation.,"Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins mediate organelle fusion in the secretory pathway. Different fusion steps are catalyzed by specific sets of SNARE proteins. Here we have used the SNAREs mediating the fusion of early endosomes and exocytosis, respectively, to investigate how pairing specificity is achieved. Although both sets of SNAREs promiscuously assemble in vitro, there is no functional crosstalk. We now show that they not only colocalize to overlapping microdomains in the membrane of early endosomes of neuroendocrine cells, but also form cis-complexes promiscuously, with the proportion of the different complexes being primarily dependent on mass action. Addition of soluble SNARE molecules onto native membranes revealed preference for cognate SNAREs. Furthermore, we found that SNAREs are laterally segregated at endosome contact sites, with the exocytotic synaptobrevin being depleted. We conclude that specificity in endosome fusion is mediated by the following two synergistically operating mechanisms: (i) preference for the cognate SNARE in 'trans' interactions and (ii) lateral segregation of SNAREs, leading to relative enrichment of the cognate ones at the prospective fusion sites."
19696018,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Poliovirus entry into human brain microvascular cells requires receptor-induced activation of SHP-2.,"Viruses use specific receptor molecules to bind selectively to target cells. Receptors have often been considered as mere docking sites, but they may also possess intrinsic signaling capacities that serve to prime the cell for entry and infection. Poliovirus (PV) initiates infection by binding to the PV receptor (PVR) and causes paralytic poliomyelitis by replicating within motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. We have examined the process by which PV enters cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. We found that PV enters HBMEC by dynamin-dependent caveolar endocytosis, and that entry depends on intracellular signals triggered by virus attachment to PVR. Tyrosine kinase and RhoA GTPase activation initiated by PVR ligation were both essential. Virus attachment also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PVR; this permitted the association of PVR with SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase whose activation was required for entry and infection. The results indicate that receptor-induced signals promote virus entry and suggest a role for tyrosine phosphatases in viral pathogenesis."
19696030,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,A sequential program of dual phosphorylation of KaiC as a basis for circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria.,"The circadian phosphorylation cycle of the cyanobacterial clock protein KaiC has been reconstituted in vitro. The phosphorylation profiles of two phosphorylation sites in KaiC, serine 431 (S431) and threonine 432 (T432), revealed that the phosphorylation cycle contained four steps: (i) T432 phosphorylation; (ii) S431 phosphorylation to generate the double-phosphorylated form of KaiC; (iii) T432 dephosphorylation; and (iv) S431 dephosphorylation. We then examined the effects of mutations introduced at one KaiC phosphorylation site on the intact phosphorylation site. We found that the product of each step in the phosphorylation cycle regulated the reaction in the next step, and that double phosphorylation converted KaiC from an autokinase to an autophosphatase, whereas complete dephosphorylation had the opposite effect. These mechanisms serve as the basis for cyanobacterial circadian rhythm generation. We also found that associations among KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC result from S431 phosphorylation, and these interactions would maintain the amplitude of the rhythm."
19696410,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Exo70 interacts with phospholipids and mediates the targeting of the exocyst to the plasma membrane.,"The exocyst is an octameric protein complex implicated in the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane before fusion. The function of individual exocyst components and the mechanism by which this tethering complex is targeted to sites of secretion are not clear. In this study, we report that the exocyst subunit Exo70 functions in concert with Sec3 to anchor the exocyst to the plasma membrane. We found that the C-terminal Domain D of Exo70 directly interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In addition, we have identified key residues on Exo70 that are critical for its interaction with phospholipids and the small GTPase Rho3. Further genetic and cell biological analyses suggest that the interaction of Exo70 with phospholipids, but not Rho3, is essential for the membrane association of the exocyst complex. We propose that Exo70 mediates the assembly of the exocyst complex at the plasma membrane, which is a crucial step in the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles for exocytosis."
19696743,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,The MIT domain of UBPY constitutes a CHMP binding and endosomal localization signal required for efficient epidermal growth factor receptor degradation.,"We have identified and characterized a Microtubule Interacting and Transport (MIT) domain at the N terminus of the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY/USP8. In common with other MIT-containing proteins such as AMSH and VPS4, UBPY can interact with CHMP proteins, which are known to regulate endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated receptors. Comparison of binding preferences for the 11 members of the human CHMP family between the UBPY MIT domain and another ubiquitin isopeptidase, AMSH, reveals common interactions with CHMP1A and CHMP1B but a distinct selectivity of AMSH for CHMP3/VPS24, a core subunit of the ESCRT-III complex, and UBPY for CHMP7. We also show that in common with AMSH, UBPY deubiquitinating enzyme activity can be stimulated by STAM but is unresponsive to its cognate CHMPs. The UBPY MIT domain is dispensable for its catalytic activity but is essential for its localization to endosomes. This is functionally significant as an MIT-deleted UBPY mutant is unable to rescue its binding partner STAM from proteasomal degradation or reverse a block to epidermal growth factor receptor degradation imposed by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of UBPY."
19696922,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,Identification of a redox-sensitive cysteine in GCP60 that regulates its interaction with golgin-160.,"Golgin-160 is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates. It localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi and has a large C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The noncoiled-coil N-terminal head domain contains Golgi targeting information, a cryptic nuclear localization signal, and three caspase cleavage sites. Caspase cleavage of the golgin-160 head domain generates different fragments that can translocate to the nucleus by exposing the nuclear localization signal. We have previously shown that GCP60, a Golgi resident protein, interacts weakly with the golgin-160 head domain but has a strong interaction with one of the caspase-generated golgin-160 fragments (residues 140-311). This preferential interaction increases the Golgi retention of the golgin-160 fragment in cells overexpressing GCP60. Here we studied the interaction of golgin-160-(140-311) with GCP60 and identified a single cysteine residue in GCP60 (Cys-463) that is critical for the interaction of the two proteins. Mutation of the cysteine blocked the interaction in vitro and disrupted the ability to retain the golgin-160 fragment at the Golgi in cells. We also found that Cys-463 is redox-sensitive; in its reduced form, interaction with golgin-160 was diminished or abolished, whereas oxidation of the Cys-463 by hydrogen peroxide restored the interaction. In addition, incubation with a nitric oxide donor promoted this interaction in vitro. These findings suggest that nuclear translocation of golgin-160-(140-311) is a highly coordinated event regulated not only by cleavage of the golgin-160 head but also by the oxidation state of GCP60."
19698094,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Amyolid precursor protein mediates presynaptic localization and activity of the high-affinity choline transporter.,"The key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease include synaptic dysfunction, profound changes in the cholinergic system, and deposition of beta-amyloid peptides generated by proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). However, the pathways linking APP with synaptic activity and cholinergic neuronal function are poorly understood. We report here that APP is essential in regulating the presynaptic expression and activity of the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), a molecule that mediates the rate-limiting step of cholinergic synaptic transmission in both the neuromuscular junction and central cholinergic neurons. Loss of APP leads to aberrant localization of CHT at the neuromuscular synapses and reduced CHT activity at cholinergic projections. At the cellular level, we show that APP and CHT can be found in Rab5-positive endosomal compartments and that APP affects CHT endocytosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APP interacts with CHT through the C-terminal domain, providing support for a specific and direct regulation of CHT by APP through protein-protein interactions. These results identify a physiological activity of APP in cholinergic neurons, and our data indicate that deregulation of APP function may contribute to cholinergic impairment and AD pathogenesis."
19698104,0,Mol. Cell. Biol.,8109087,2007,Vaccinia-related kinase 2 modulates the stress response to hypoxia mediated by TAK1.,"Hypoxia represents a major stress that requires an immediate cellular response in which different signaling pathways participate. Hypoxia induces an increase in the activity of TAK1, an atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), which responds to oxidative stress by triggering cascades leading to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK activation by hypoxia requires assembly with the JIP1 scaffold protein, which might also interact with other intracellular proteins that are less well known but that might modulate MAPK signaling. We report that TAK1 is able to form a stable complex with JIP1 and thus regulate the activation of JNK, which in turn determines the cellular stress response to hypoxia. This activation of TAK1-JIP1-JNK is suppressed by vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2). VRK2A is able to interact with TAK1 by its C-terminal region, forming stable complexes. The kinase activity of VRK2 is not necessary for this interaction or the downregulation of AP1-dependent transcription. Furthermore, reduction of the endogenous VRK2 level with short hairpin RNA can increase the response induced by hypoxia, suggesting that the intracellular levels of VRK2 can determine the magnitude of this stress response."
19698141,0,Genes Dev.,8711660,2007,Switching of the core transcription machinery during myogenesis.,"Transcriptional mechanisms that govern cellular differentiation typically include sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and chromatin-modifying activities. These regulatory factors are assumed necessary and sufficient to drive both divergent programs of proliferation and terminal differentiation. By contrast, potential contributions of the basal transcriptional apparatus to orchestrate cell-specific gene expression have been poorly explored. In order to probe alternative mechanisms that control differentiation, we have assessed the fate of the core promoter recognition complex, TFIID, during skeletal myogenesis. Here we report that differentiation of myoblast to myotubes involves the disruption of the canonical holo-TFIID and replacement by a novel TRF3/TAF3 (TBP-related factor 3/TATA-binding protein-associated factor 3) complex. This required switching of core promoter complexes provides organisms a simple yet effective means to selectively turn on one transcriptional program while silencing many others. Although this drastic but parsimonious transcriptional switch had previously escaped our attention, it may represent a more general mechanism for regulating cell type-specific terminal differentiation."
19699172,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,"Essential role for TAX1BP1 in the termination of TNF-alpha-, IL-1- and LPS-mediated NF-kappaB and JNK signaling.","The NF-kappaB transcription factor is normally transiently activated by proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS); however, persistent NF-kappaB activation is commonly observed in inflammatory disease and malignancy. The ubiquitin editing enzyme A20 serves an essential role in the termination of TNF-alpha- and LPS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling by inactivating key signaling molecules. However, little is known about how A20 is regulated and if other molecules play a role in the termination of NF-kappaB signaling. Here we demonstrate that Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) is essential for the termination of NF-kappaB and JNK activation in response to TNF-alpha, IL-1 and LPS stimulation. In TAX1BP1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, TNF-alpha-, IL-1- and LPS-mediated IKK and JNK activation is elevated and persistent owing to enhanced ubiquitination of RIP1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, in the absence of TAX1BP1, A20 is impaired in RIP1 binding, deubiquitination of TRAF6 and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Thus, TAX1BP1 is pivotal for the termination of NF-kappaB and JNK signaling by functioning as an essential regulator of A20."
19700180,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Structural basis of the collagen-binding mode of discoidin domain receptor 2.,"Discoidin domain receptor (DDR) is a cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase activated by the binding of its discoidin (DS) domain to fibrillar collagen. Here, we have determined the NMR structure of the DS domain in DDR2 (DDR2-DS domain), and identified the binding site to fibrillar collagen by transferred cross-saturation experiments. The DDR2-DS domain structure adopts a distorted jellyroll fold, consisting of eight beta-strands. The collagen-binding site is formed at the interloop trench, consisting of charged residues surrounded by hydrophobic residues. The surface profile of the collagen-binding site suggests that the DDR2-DS domain recognizes specific sites on fibrillar collagen. This study provides a molecular basis for the collagen-binding mode of the DDR2-DS domain."
19700410,1,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,"The UT-A1 urea transporter interacts with snapin, a SNARE-associated protein.","The UT-A1 urea transporter mediates rapid transepithelial urea transport across the inner medullary collecting duct and plays a major role in the urinary concentrating mechanism. To transport urea, UT-A1 must be present in the plasma membrane. The purpose of this study was to screen for UT-A1-interacting proteins and to study the interactions of one of the identified potential binding partners with UT-A1. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library with the UT-A1 intracellular loop (residues 409-594) as bait, we identified snapin, a ubiquitously expressed SNARE-associated protein, as a novel UT-A1 binding partner. Deletion analysis indicated that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (H2) of snapin is required for UT-A1 interaction. Snapin binds to the intracellular loop of UT-A1 but not to the N- or C-terminal fragments. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments and co-immunoprecipitation studies verified that snapin interacts with native UT-A1, SNAP23, and syntaxin-4 (t-SNARE partners), indicating that UT-A1 participates with the SNARE machinery in rat kidney inner medulla. Confocal microscopic analysis of immunofluorescent UT-A1 and snapin showed co-localization in both the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane. When we co-injected UT-A1 with snapin cRNA in Xenopus oocytes, urea influx was significantly increased. In the absence of snapin, the influx was decreased when UT-A1 was combined with t-SNARE components syntaxin-4 and SNAP23. We conclude that UT-A1 may be linked to the SNARE machinery via snapin and that this interaction may be functionally and physiologically important for urea transport."
19700528,0,Genes Dev.,8711660,2007,Independent and interdependent functions of LAF1 and HFR1 in phytochrome A signaling.,"Several positive regulators of phytochrome A signaling--e.g., LAF1, HFR1, and HY5--operate downstream from the photoreceptor, but their relative sites of action in the transduction pathway are unknown. Here, we show that HFR1RNAi/laf1 or hfr1-201/LAF1RNAi generated by RNA interference (RNAi) has an additive phenotype under FR light compared with the single mutants, hfr1-201 or laf1. This result indicates that LAF1 and HFR1 function in largely independent pathways. LAF1, an R2R3-MYB factor, interacts with HFR1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, and this interaction is abolished by the R97A mutation in the LAF1 R2R3 domain. Polyubiquitinations of LAF1 and HFR1 by the COP1 E3 ligase in vitro are inhibited by LAF1/HFR1 association. Consistent with this result, endogenous HFR1 is less stable in laf1 compared with wild type, and similarly, LAF1-3HA expressed from a transgene is also less stable in hfr1-201 than wild type. In transgenic plants, HFR1 levels are significantly elevated upon induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A). Moreover, induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A) delays post-translational HFR1 degradation in FR light. Constitutive coexpression of HFR1 and LAF1 but not HFR1 and LAF1 (R97A) confers FR hypersensitivity in double transgenic plants. Our results show that in addition to their independent functions in phyA signaling, LAF1 and HFR1 also cooperate post-translationally to stabilize each other through inhibition of ubiquitination by COP1, thereby enhancing phyA photoresponses."
19700652,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2007,In vivo hexamerization and characterization of the Arabidopsis AAA ATPase CDC48A complex using forster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.,"The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AAA ATPase CDC48A was fused to cerulean fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein. AAA ATPases like CDC48 are only active in hexameric form. Förster resonance energy transfer-based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy using CDC48A-cerulean fluorescent protein and CDC48A-yellow fluorescent protein showed interaction between two adjacent protomers, demonstrating homo-oligomerization occurs in living plant cells. Interaction between CDC48A and the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (SERK1) transmembrane receptor occurs in very restricted domains at the plasma membrane. In these domains the predominant form of the fluorescently tagged CDC48A protein is a hexamer, suggesting that SERK1 is associated with the active form of CDC48A in vivo. SERK1 trans-phosphorylates CDC48A on Ser-41. Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy was used to show that in vivo the C-terminal domains of CDC48A stay in close proximity. Employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, it was shown that CDC48A hexamers are part of larger complexes."
19701183,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Structural insights into the transcriptional and translational roles of Ebp1.,"The ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1) is an important regulator of transcription, affecting eukaryotic cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and survival. Ebp1 can also affect translation and cooperates with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) to stimulate the activity of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We report here the crystal structure of murine Ebp1 (p48 isoform), providing the first glimpse of the architecture of this versatile regulator. The structure reveals a core domain that is homologous to methionine aminopeptidases, coupled to a C-terminal extension that contains important motifs for binding proteins and RNA. It sheds new light on the conformational differences between the p42 and p48 isoforms of Ebp1, the disposition of the key protein-interacting motif ((354)LKALL(358)) and the RNA-binding activity of Ebp1. We show that the primary RNA-binding site is formed by a Lys-rich motif in the C terminus and mediates the interaction with the FMDV IRES. We also demonstrate a specific functional requirement for Ebp1 in FMDV IRES-directed translation that is independent of a direct interaction with PTB."
19701453,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The candidate tumor suppressor BTG3 is a transcriptional target of p53 that inhibits E2F1.,"Proper regulation of cell cycle progression is pivotal for maintaining genome stability. In a search for DNA damage-inducible, CHK1-modulated genes, we have identified BTG3 (B-cell translocation gene 3) as a direct p53 target. The p53 transcription factor binds to a consensus sequence located in intron 2 of the gene both in vitro and in vivo, and depletion of p53 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolishes DNA damage-induced expression of the gene. Furthermore, ablation of BTG3 by siRNA in cancer cells results in accelerated exit from the DNA damage-induced G2/M block. In vitro, BTG3 binds to and inhibits E2F1 through an N-terminal domain including the conserved box A. Deletion of the interaction domain in BTG3 abrogates not only its growth suppression activity, but also its repression on E2F1-mediated transactivation. We also present evidence that by disrupting the DNA binding activity of E2F1, BTG3 participates in the regulation of E2F1 target gene expression. Therefore, our studies have revealed a previously unidentified pathway through which the activity of E2F1 may be guarded by activated p53."
19701459,0,Science,404511,2007,Augmented Wnt signaling in a mammalian model of accelerated aging.,"The contribution of stem and progenitor cell dysfunction and depletion in normal aging remains incompletely understood. We explored this concept in the Klotho mouse model of accelerated aging. Analysis of various tissues and organs from young Klotho mice revealed a decrease in stem cell number and an increase in progenitor cell senescence. Because klotho is a secreted protein, we postulated that klotho might interact with other soluble mediators of stem cells. We found that klotho bound to various Wnt family members. In a cell culture model, the Wnt-klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt biological activity. Tissues and organs from klotho-deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling, and ectopic expression of klotho antagonized the activity of endogenous and exogenous Wnt. Both in vitro and in vivo, continuous Wnt exposure triggered accelerated cellular senescence. Thus, klotho appears to be a secreted Wnt antagonist and Wnt proteins have an unexpected role in mammalian aging."

We have determined structures of human PDK1 or PDK3 bound to the inhibitors AZD7545, dichloroacetate (DCA), and radicicol. We show that the trifluoromethylpropanamide end of AZD7545 projects into the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK1. This interaction results in inhibition of PDK1 and PDK3 activities by aborting kinase binding to the PDC scaffold. Paradoxically, AZD7545 at saturating concentrations robustly increases scaffold-free PDK3 activity, similar to the inner lipoyl domain. Good DCA density is present in the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of PDK1. Bound DCA promotes local conformational changes that are communicated to both nucleotide-binding and lipoyl-binding pockets of PDK1, leading to the inactivation of kinase activity. Finally, radicicol inhibits kinase activity by binding directly to the ATP-binding pocket of PDK3, similar to Hsp90 and Topo VI from the same ATPase/kinase superfamily."

Cell,101120028,2007,An essential role for 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in Arabidopsis.,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential hormones for plant growth and development. BRs regulate gene expression by inducing dephosphorylation of two key transcription factors, BZR1 and BZR2/BES1, through a signal transduction pathway that involves cell-surface receptors (BRI1 and BAK1) and a GSK3 kinase (BIN2). How BR-regulated phosphorylation controls the activities of BZR1/BZR2 is not fully understood. Here, we show that BIN2-catalyzed phosphorylation of BZR1/BZR2 not only inhibits DNA binding, but also promotes binding to the 14-3-3 proteins. Mutations of a BIN2-phosphorylation site in BZR1 abolish 14-3-3 binding and lead to increased nuclear localization of BZR1 protein and enhanced BR responses in transgenic plants. Further, BR deficiency increases cytoplasmic localization, and BR treatment induces rapid nuclear localization of BZR1/BZR2. Thus, 14-3-3 binding is required for efficient inhibition of phosphorylated BR transcription factors, largely through cytoplasmic retention. This study demonstrates that multiple mechanisms are required for BR regulation of gene expression and plant growth."

However, the mechanistic basis for centromere maintenance is unknown. We investigated biochemical properties of CenH3 nucleosomes from Drosophila melanogaster cells. Cross-linking of CenH3 nucleosomes identifies heterotypic tetramers containing one copy of CenH3, H2A, H2B, and H4 each. Interphase CenH3 particles display a stable association of approximately 120 DNA base pairs. Purified centromeric nucleosomal arrays have typical &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; appearance by electron microscopy but appear to resist condensation under physiological conditions. Atomic force microscopy reveals that native CenH3-containing nucleosomes are only half as high as canonical octameric nucleosomes are, confirming that the tetrameric structure detected by cross-linking comprises the entire interphase nucleosome particle. This demonstration of stable half-nucleosomes in vivo provides a possible basis for the instability of centromeric nucleosomes that are deposited in euchromatic regions, which might help maintain centromere identity."

IL-33 mediates signal transduction through ST2, a receptor expressed on Th2 and mast cells. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-33 and ST2 form a complex with IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), a signaling receptor subunit that is also a member of the IL-1R complex. Additionally, IL-1RAcP is required for IL-33-induced in vivo effects, and IL-33-mediated signal transduction can be inhibited by dominant-negative IL-1RAcP. The implications of this shared usage of IL-1RAcP by IL-1(alpha and beta) and IL-33 are discussed."
19703229,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,The Arabidopsis transcription factor MYB77 modulates auxin signal transduction.,"Auxin is a key plant hormone that regulates plant development, apical dominance, and growth-related tropisms, such as phototropism and gravitropism. In this study, we report a new Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor, MYB77, that is involved in auxin response. In MYB77 knockout plants, we found that auxin-responsive gene expression was greatly attenuated. Lateral root density in the MYB77 knockout was lower than the wild type at low concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and also under low nutrient conditions. MYB77 interacts with auxin response factors (ARFs) in vitro through the C terminus (domains III and IV) of ARFs and the activation domain of MYB77. A synergistic genetic interaction was demonstrated between MYB77 and ARF7 that resulted in a strong reduction in lateral root numbers. Experiments with protoplasts confirmed that the coexpression of MYB77 and an ARF C terminus enhance reporter gene expression. R2R3 MYB transcription factors have not been previously implicated in regulating the expression of auxin-inducible genes. Also it was previously unknown that ARFs interact with proteins other than those in the Aux/IAA family via conserved domains. The interaction between MYB77 and ARFs defines a new type of combinatorial transcriptional control in plants. This newly defined transcription factor interaction is part of the plant cells' repertoire for modulating response to auxin, thereby controlling lateral root growth and development under changing environmental conditions."
19703313,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Structural and functional characterization of a novel type of ligand-independent RXR-USP receptor.,"Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) play a central role as ubiquitous heterodimerization partners of many nuclear receptors. While it has long been accepted that a wide range of ligands can activate vertebrate/mollusc RXRs, the existence and necessity of specific endogenous ligands activating RXR-USP in vivo is still matter of intense debate. Here we report the existence of a novel type of RXR-USP with a ligand-independent functional conformation. Our studies involved Tribolium USP (TcUSP) as representative of most arthropod RXR-USPs, with high sequence homology to vertebrate/mollusc RXRs. The crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of TcUSP was solved in the context of the functional heterodimer with the ecdysone receptor (EcR). While EcR exhibits a canonical ligand-bound conformation, USP adopts an original apo structure. Our functional data demonstrate that TcUSP is a constitutively silent partner of EcR, and that none of the RXR ligands can bind and activate TcUSP. These findings together with a phylogenetic analysis suggest that RXR-USPs have undergone remarkable functional shifts during evolution and give insight into receptor-ligand binding evolution and dynamics."

The dimorphic fungus Candida albicans uses Cdc28/Hgc1, a CDK/cyclin complex, to promote persistent actin polarization for hyphal growth. Here, we report that Rga2, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) of the central polarity regulator Cdc42, undergoes Hgc1-dependent hyperphosphorylation. Using the analog-sensitive Cdc28as mutant, we confirmed that Cdc28 controls Rga2 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Deleting RGA2 produced elongated yeast cells without apparent effect on hyphal morphogenesis. However, deleting it or inactivating its GAP activity restored hyphal growth in hgc1Delta mutants, suggesting that Rga2 represses hyphal development and Cdc28/Hgc1 inactivates it upon hyphal induction. We provide evidence that Cdc28/Hgc1 may act to prevent Rga2 from localizing to hyphal tips, leading to localized Cdc42 activation for hyphal extension. Rga2 also undergoes transient Cdc28-dependent hyperphosphorylation at bud emergence, suggesting that regulating a GAP(s) of Cdc42 by CDKs may play an important role in governing different forms of polarized morphogenesis in yeast. This study reveals a direct molecular link between CDKs and the polarity machinery."
19703417,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,TGF-beta activates Erk MAP kinase signalling through direct phosphorylation of ShcA.,"Erk1/Erk2 MAP kinases are key regulators of cell behaviour and their activation is generally associated with tyrosine kinase signalling. However, TGF-beta stimulation also activates Erk MAP kinases through an undefined mechanism, albeit to a much lower level than receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation. We report that upon TGF-beta stimulation, the activated TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) recruits and directly phosphorylates ShcA proteins on tyrosine and serine. This dual phosphorylation results from an intrinsic TbetaRI tyrosine kinase activity that complements its well-defined serine-threonine kinase function. TGF-beta-induced ShcA phosphorylation induces ShcA association with Grb2 and Sos, thereby initiating the well-characterised pathway linking receptor tyrosine kinases with Erk MAP kinases. We also found that TbetaRI is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TGF-beta. Thus, TbetaRI, like the TGF-beta type II receptor, is a dual-specificity kinase. Recruitment of tyrosine kinase signalling pathways may account for aspects of TGF-beta biology that are independent of Smad signalling."
19703418,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,Different activities of the largest subunit of replication protein A cooperate during SV40 DNA replication.,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a stable heterotrimeric complex consisting of p70, p32 and p14 subunits. The protein plays a crucial role in SV40 minichromosome replication. Peptides of p70 representing interaction sites for the smaller two subunits, DNA as well as the viral initiator protein large T-antigen (Tag) and the cellular DNA polymerase alpha-primase (Pol) all interfered with the replication process indicating the importance of the different p70 activities in this process. Inhibition by the peptide disrupting protein-protein interactions was observed only during the pre-initiation stage prior to primer synthesis, suggesting the formation of a stable initiation complex between RPA, Tag and Pol at the primer end."
19703972,0,Mol. Syst. Biol.,101235389,2007,The protein network of bacterial motility.,"Motility is achieved in most bacterial species by the flagellar apparatus. It consists of dozens of different proteins with thousands of individual subunits. The published literature about bacterial chemotaxis and flagella documented 51 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) so far. We have screened whole genome two-hybrid arrays of Treponema pallidum and Campylobacter jejuni for PPIs involving known flagellar proteins and recovered 176 and 140 high-confidence interactions involving 110 and 133 proteins, respectively. To explore the biological relevance of these interactions, we tested an Escherichia coli gene deletion array for motility defects (using swarming assays) and found 159 gene deletion strains to have reduced or no motility. Comparing our interaction data with motility phenotypes from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Helicobacter pylori, we found 23 hitherto uncharacterized proteins involved in motility. Integration of phylogenetic information with our interaction and phenotyping data reveals a conserved core of motility proteins, which appear to have recruited many additional species-specific components over time. Our interaction data also predict 18,110 interactions for 64 flagellated bacteria."
19704008,1,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2007,Timed interactions between viral and cellular replication factors during the initiation of SV40 in vitro DNA replication.,"The initiation of SV40 (simian virus 40) DNA replication requires the co-operative interactions between the viral Tag (large T-antigen), RPA (replication protein A) and Pol (DNA polymerase alpha-primase) on the template DNA. Binding interfaces mapped on these enzymes and expressed as peptides competed with the mutual interactions of the native proteins. Prevention of the genuine interactions was accomplished only prior to the primer synthesis step and blocked the assembly of a productive initiation complex. Once the complex was engaged in the synthesis of an RNA primer and its extension, the interfering effects of the peptides ceased, suggesting a stable association of the replication factors during the initiation phase. Specific antibodies were still able to disrupt preformed interactions and inhibited primer synthesis and extension activities, underlining the crucial role of specific protein-protein contacts during the entire initiation process."
19705505,0,Biochem. J.,2984726R,2007,Identification and characterization of two closely related histone H4 arginine 3 methyltransferases in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Arginine methylation of histone H3 and H4 plays important roles in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes such as yeasts, fruitflies, nematode worms, fish and mammals; however, less is known in plants. In the present paper, we report the identification and characterization of two Arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine N-methyltransferases, AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, which exhibit high homology with human PRMT1. Both AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b methylated histone H4, H2A, and myelin basic protein in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of the third arginine (R3) on the N-terminus of histone H4 to lysine (H4R3N) completely abolished the methylation of histone H4. When fused to GFP (green fluorescent protein), both methyltransferases localized to the cytoplasm as well as to the nucleus. Consistent with their subcellular distribution, GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down assays revealed an interaction between the two methyltransferases, suggesting that both proteins may act together in a functional unit. In addition, we demonstrated that AtFib2 (Arabidopsis thaliana fibrillarin 2), an RNA methyltransferase, is a potential substrate for AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, and, furthermore, uncovered a direct interaction between the protein methyltransferase and the RNA methyltransferase. Taken together, our findings implicate AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b as H4-R3 protein arginine N-methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and may be involved in diverse biological processes inside and outside the nucleus."
19706281,0,Cell,413066,2007,A metabolic sensor governing cell size in bacteria.,"Nutrient availability is one of the strongest determinants of cell size. When grown in rich media, single-celled organisms such as yeast and bacteria can be up to twice the size of their slow-growing counterparts. The ability to modulate size in a nutrient-dependent manner requires cells to: (1) detect when they have reached the appropriate mass for a given growth rate and (2) transmit this information to the division apparatus. We report the identification of a metabolic sensor that couples nutritional availability to division in Bacillus subtilis. A key component of this sensor is an effector, UgtP, which localizes to the division site in a nutrient-dependent manner and inhibits assembly of the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ. This sensor serves to maintain a constant ratio of FtsZ rings to cell length regardless of growth rate and ensures that cells reach the appropriate mass and complete chromosome segregation prior to cytokinesis."
19706396,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,Protein-protein interactions among human lens acidic and basic beta-crystallins.,"Human lens beta-crystallin contains four acidic (betaA1--&gt;betaA4) and three basic (betaB1--&gt;betaB3) subunits. They oligomerize in the lens, but it is uncertain which subunits are involved in the oligomerization. We used a two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions systematically. Proteins were also expressed for some physicochemical studies. The results indicate that all acidic-basic pairs (betaA-betaB) except betaA4-betaBs pairs show strong hetero-molecular interactions. For acidic or basic pairs, only two pairs (betaA1-betaA1 and betaA3-betaA3) show strong self-association. betaA2 and betaA4 show very weak self-association, which arises from their low solubility. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows enormous protein aggregates in betaA2- or betaA4-crystallin transfected cells. However, coexpression with betaB2-crystallin decreased both the number and size of aggregates. Circular dichroism indicates subtle differences in conformation among beta-crystallins that may have contributed to the differences in interactions."
19706409,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,AChBP-targeted alpha-conotoxin correlates distinct binding orientations with nAChR subtype selectivity.,"Neuronal nAChRs are a diverse family of pentameric ion channels with wide distribution throughout cells of the nervous and immune systems. However, the role of specific subtypes in normal and pathological states remains poorly understood due to the lack of selective probes. Here, we used a binding assay based on acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a homolog of the nicotinic acetylcholine ligand-binding domain, to discover a novel alpha-conotoxin (alpha-TxIA) in the venom of Conus textile. Alpha-TxIA bound with high affinity to AChBPs from different species and selectively targeted the alpha(3)beta(2) nAChR subtype. A co-crystal structure of Ac-AChBP with the enhanced potency analog TxIA(A10L), revealed a 20 degrees backbone tilt compared to other AChBP-conotoxin complexes. This reorientation was coordinated by a key salt bridge formed between Arg5 (TxIA) and Asp195 (Ac-AChBP). Mutagenesis studies, biochemical assays and electrophysiological recordings directly correlated the interactions observed in the co-crystal structure to binding affinity at AChBP and different nAChR subtypes. Together, these results establish a new pharmacophore for the design of novel subtype-selective ligands with therapeutic potential in nAChR-related diseases."
19706423,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,In vivo analysis of cohesin architecture using FRET in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Cohesion between sister chromatids in eukaryotes is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex. Cohesin forms a proteinaceous ring, large enough to trap pairs of replicated sister chromatids. The circumference consists of the Smc1 and Smc3 subunits, while Scc1 is thought to close the ring by bridging the Smc (structural maintenance of chromosomes) ATPase head domains. Little is known about two additional subunits, Scc3 and Pds5, and about possible conformational changes of the complex during the cell cycle. We have employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to analyse interactions within the cohesin complex in live budding yeast. These experiments reveal an unexpected geometry of Scc1 at the Smc heads, and suggest that Pds5 plays a role at the Smc hinge on the opposite side of the ring. Key subunit interactions, including close proximity of the two ATPase heads, are constitutive throughout the cell cycle. This depicts cohesin as a stable molecular machine undergoing only transient conformational changes during binding and dissociation from chromosomes. Using FRET, we did not observe interactions between more than one cohesin complex in vivo."
19706464,1,Virol. J.,101231645,2007,An ectromelia virus profilin homolog interacts with cellular tropomyosin and viral A-type inclusion protein.,"BACKGROUND: Profilins are critical to cytoskeletal dynamics in eukaryotes; however, little is known about their viral counterparts. In this study, a poxviral profilin homolog, ectromelia virus strain Moscow gene 141 (ECTV-PH), was investigated by a variety of experimental and bioinformatics techniques to characterize its interactions with cellular and viral proteins. RESULTS: Profilin-like proteins are encoded by all orthopoxviruses sequenced to date, and share over 90% amino acid (aa) identity. Sequence comparisons show highest similarity to mammalian type 1 profilins; however, a conserved 3 aa deletion in mammalian type 3 and poxviral profilins suggests that these homologs may be more closely related. Structural analysis shows that ECTV-PH can be successfully modelled onto both the profilin 1 crystal structure and profilin 3 homology model, though few of the surface residues thought to be required for binding actin, poly(L-proline), and PIP2 are conserved. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified two proteins that interact with ECTV-PH within infected cells: alpha-tropomyosin, a 38 kDa cellular actin-binding protein, and the 84 kDa product of vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACV-WR) 148, which is the truncated VACV counterpart of the orthopoxvirus A-type inclusion (ATI) protein. Western and far-western blots demonstrated that the interaction with alpha-tropomyosin is direct, and immunofluorescence experiments suggest that ECTV-PH and alpha-tropomyosin may colocalize to structures that resemble actin tails and cellular protrusions. Sequence comparisons of the poxviral ATI proteins show that although full-length orthologs are only present in cowpox and ectromelia viruses, an ~ 700 aa truncated ATI protein is conserved in over 90% of sequenced orthopoxviruses. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that ECTV-PH localizes to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies formed by both truncated and full-length versions of the viral ATI protein. Furthermore, colocalization of ECTV-PH and truncated ATI protein to protrusions from the cell surface was observed. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a role for ECTV-PH in intracellular transport of viral proteins or intercellular spread of the virus. Broader implications include better understanding of the virus-host relationship and mechanisms by which cells organize and control the actin cytoskeleton."
19706491,0,Plant Cell,9208688,2007,Functional analysis of the epidermal-specific MYB genes CAPRICE and WEREWOLF in Arabidopsis.,"Epidermis cell differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana is a model system for understanding the developmental end state of plant cells. Two types of MYB transcription factors, R2R3-MYB and R3-MYB, are involved in cell fate determination. To examine the molecular basis of this process, we analyzed the functional relationship of the R2R3-type MYB gene WEREWOLF (WER) and the R3-type MYB gene CAPRICE (CPC). Chimeric constructs made from the R3 MYB regions of WER and CPC used in reciprocal complementation experiments showed that the CPC R3 region cannot functionally substitute for the WER R3 region in the differentiation of hairless cells. However, WER R3 can substantially substitute for CPC R3. There are no differences in yeast interaction assays of WER or WER chimera proteins with GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3). CPC and CPC chimera proteins also have similar activity in preventing GL3 WER and EGL3 WER interactions. Furthermore, we showed by gel mobility shift assays that WER chimera proteins do not bind to the GL2 promoter region. However, a CPC chimera protein, which harbors the WER R3 motif, still binds to the GL2 promoter region."
19706524,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,MED25 is distinct from TRAP220/MED1 in cooperating with CBP for retinoid receptor activation.,"We isolated MED25, which associates with retinoic acid (RA)-bound retinoic acid receptor (RAR) through the C-terminal nuclear hormone receptor (NR) box/LxxLL motif, and increases RAR/RXR-mediated transcription. When tethered to a promoter, MED25 showed intrinsic transcriptional activity in its PTOV domain, which is likely accomplished by direct association with CBP. Reporter assays using dominant negatives of MED25 demonstrated the importance of the N-terminal Mediator-binding and C-terminal domains in CBP and RAR/RXR binding, which affect MED25 activity. Downregulation of MED25 specifically reduced RAR but not thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activity. Stimulation of RAR by MED25 was correlated with enhanced RA cytotoxicity in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed the RA-dependent recruitment of MED25 to the RARbeta2 promoter. Recruitment of CBP and TRAP220 was diminished by the overexpression of a MED25 NR box deletion mutant, and by treatment with MED25 siRNA. Time-course ChIP assays indicated that CBP, together with RAR and MED25, is recruited early, whereas TRAP220 is recruited later to the promoter. Our data suggest that MED25, in cooperation with CBP and Mediators through its distinct domains, imposes a selective advantage on RAR/RXR activation."
19706544,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The structural basis of novel endosome anchoring activity of KIF16B kinesin.,"KIF16B is a newly identified kinesin that regulates the intracellular motility of early endosomes. KIF16B is unique among kinesins in that its cargo binding is mediated primarily by the strong interaction of its PX domain with endosomal lipids. To elucidate the structural basis of this unique endosomal anchoring activity of KIF16B-PX, we determined the crystal structure of the PX domain and performed in vitro and cellular membrane binding measurements for KIF16B-PX and mutants. The most salient structural feature of KIF16B-PX is that two neighboring residues, L1248 and F1249, on the membrane-binding surface form a protruding hydrophobic stalk with a large solvent-accessible surface area. This unique structure, arising from the complementary stacking of the two side chains and the local conformation, allows strong hydrophobic membrane interactions and endosome tethering. The presence of similar hydrophobic pairs in the amino-acid sequences of other membrane-binding domains and proteins suggests that the same structural motif may be shared by other membrane-binding proteins, whose physiological functions depend on strong hydrophobic membrane interactions."
19706677,1,Structure,101087697,2007,Functional and crystal structure analysis of active site adaptations of a potent anti-angiogenic human tRNA synthetase.,"Higher eukaryote tRNA synthetases have expanded functions that come from enlarged, more differentiated structures that were adapted to fit aminoacylation function. How those adaptations affect catalytic mechanisms is not known. Presented here is the structure of a catalytically active natural splice variant of human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) that is a potent angiostatic factor. This and related structures suggest that a eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of the core enzyme changed substrate recognition by forming an active site cap. At the junction of the extension and core catalytic unit, an arginine is recruited to replace a missing landmark lysine almost 200 residues away. Mutagenesis, rapid kinetic, and substrate binding studies support the functional significance of the cap and arginine recruitment. Thus, the enzyme function of human TrpRS has switched more to the N terminus of the sequence. This switch has the effect of creating selective pressure to retain the N-terminal extension for functional expansion."
19706682,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,The mitochondrial TOM complex is required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release.,"Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is a key event in apoptosis signaling that is regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. Cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid by multiple proteases leads to the formation of truncated Bid (tBid), which, in turn, promotes the oligomerization/insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane and the resultant release of proteins residing in the intermembrane space. Bax, a monomeric protein in the cytosol, is targeted by a yet unknown mechanism to the mitochondria. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this targeting specificity. Using mitochondria isolated from different mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and recombinant proteins, we have now investigated components of the mitochondrial outer membrane that might be required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Here, we show that the protein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane is required for Bax insertion and cytochrome c release."
19706699,0,Plant Physiol.,401224,2007,The Arabidopsis BAP1 and BAP2 genes are general inhibitors of programmed cell death.,"Here we identify the BAP1 and BAP2 genes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as general inhibitors of programmed cell death (PCD) across the kingdoms. These two homologous genes encode small proteins containing a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain. BAP1 and its functional partner BON1 have been shown to negatively regulate defense responses and a disease resistance gene SNC1. Genetic studies here reveal an overlapping function of the BAP1 and BAP2 genes in cell death control. The loss of BAP2 function induces accelerated hypersensitive responses but does not compromise plant growth or confer enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial or oomycete pathogens. The loss of both BAP1 and BAP2 confers seedling lethality mediated by PAD4 and EDS1, two regulators of cell death and defense responses. Overexpression of BAP1 or BAP2 with their partner BON1 inhibits PCD induced by pathogens, the proapoptotic gene BAX, and superoxide-generating paraquat in Arabidopsis or Nicotiana benthamiana. Moreover, expressing BAP1 or BAP2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) alleviates cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the BAP genes function as general negative regulators of PCD induced by biotic and abiotic stimuli including reactive oxygen species. The dual roles of BAP and BON genes in repressing defense responses mediated by disease resistance genes and in inhibiting general PCD has implications in understanding the evolution of plant innate immunity."
19706768,0,Curr. Biol.,9107782,2007,The kinetochore proteins Pcs1 and Mde4 and heterochromatin are required to prevent merotelic orientation.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate chromosome segregation depends on the establishment of correct-amphitelic-kinetochore orientation. Merotelic kinetochore orientation is an error that occurs when a single kinetochore attaches to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, a condition that hinders segregation of the kinetochore to a spindle pole in anaphase. To avoid chromosome missegregation resulting from merotelic kinetochore orientation, cells have developed mechanisms to prevent or correct merotelic attachment. A protein called Pcs1 has been implicated in preventing merotelic attachment in mitosis and meiosis II in the fission yeast S. pombe. RESULTS: We report that Pcs1 forms a complex with a protein called Mde4. Both Pcs1 and Mde4 localize to the central core of centromeres. Deletion of mde4(+), like that of pcs1(+), causes the appearance of lagging chromosomes during the anaphases of mitotic and meiosis II cells. We provide evidence that the kinetochores of lagging chromosomes in both pcs1 and mde4 mutant cells are merotelically attached. In addition, we find that lagging chromosomes in cells with defective centromeric heterochromatin also display features consistent with merotelic attachment. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the Pcs1/Mde4 complex is the fission yeast counterpart of the budding yeast monopolin subcomplex Csm1/Lrs4, which promotes the segregation of sister kinetochores to the same pole during meiosis I. We propose that the Pcs1/Mde4 complex acts in the central kinetochore domain to clamp microtubule binding sites together, the centromeric heterochromatin coating the flanking domains provides rigidity, and both systems contribute to the prevention of merotelic attachment."
19707199,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,XRab40 and XCullin5 form a ubiquitin ligase complex essential for the noncanonical Wnt pathway.,"Rab GTPases are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. We sought to elucidate the roles of Rab GTPases in Xenopus gastrulation, and found that a Xenopus homolog of Rab40 (XRab40) is required for normal gastrulation. XRab40 is localized at the Golgi apparatus and interacts with ElonginB/C and Cullin5 to form a ubiquitin ligase. XRab40/XCullin5 functions cooperatively and regulates the ubiquitination and localization of Rap2 GTPase. Furthermore, XRab40/XCullin5 regulates the membrane localization of Dishevelled (Dsh), a key signaling molecule in the Wnt pathway, through Rap2 and its effector Misshapen/Nck-interacting kinase (XMINK). XMINK interacts with Dsh, and is translocated to the plasma membrane by Wnt activation. We propose a novel signaling cascade consisting of XRab40/XCullin5, Rap2 and XMINK, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the noncanonical Wnt pathway."
19707204,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Foxo1 links insulin signaling to C/EBPalpha and regulates gluconeogenesis during liver development.,"C/EBPalpha is a key transcription factor indispensable for the onset of gluconeogenesis in perinatal liver. However, C/EBPalpha was already expressed in fetal liver, suggesting that the expression of C/EBPalpha alone does not account for the dramatic increase of the expression of metabolic genes, and hence an additional factor(s) is expected to function cooperatively with C/EBPalpha in perinatal liver. We show here that expression of Foxo1 was sharply increased in the perinatal liver and augmented C/EBPalpha-dependent transcription. Foxo1 bound C/EBPalpha via its forkhead domain, and Foxo1 bound to the promoter of a gluconeogenic gene, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), in a C/EBPalpha-dependent manner in vivo. Insulin inhibited the expression of PEPCK in a culture of fetal liver cells, and also the C/EBPalpha-dependent transcription enhanced by Foxo1. These results indicate that Foxo1 regulates gluconeogenesis cooperatively with C/EBPalpha, and also links insulin signaling to C/EBPalpha during liver development."
19707592,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,HP1alpha guides neuronal fate by timing E2F-targeted genes silencing during terminal differentiation.,"A critical step of neuronal terminal differentiation is the permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle that requires the silencing of genes that drive mitosis. Here, we describe that the alpha isoform of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) protein family exerts such silencing on several E2F-targeted genes. Among the different isoforms, HP1alpha levels progressively increase throughout differentiation and take over HP1gamma binding on E2F sites in mature neurons. When overexpressed, only HP1alpha is able to ensure a timed repression of E2F genes. Specific inhibition of HP1alpha expression drives neuronal progenitors either towards death or cell cycle progression, yet preventing the expression of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in cerebellar granule neurons in vivo, during the postnatal development of the cerebellum. Finally, our results suggest that E2F-targeted genes are packaged into higher-order chromatin structures in mature neurons relative to neuroblasts, likely reflecting a transition from a 'repressed' versus 'silenced' status of these genes. Together, these data present new epigenetic regulations orchestrated by HP1 isoforms, critical for permanent cell cycle exit during neuronal differentiation."
19708087,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,PKA-induced resistance to tamoxifen is associated with an altered orientation of ERalpha towards co-activator SRC-1.,"Resistance to tamoxifen is observed in half of the recurrences in breast cancer, where the anti-estrogen tamoxifen acquires agonistic properties for transactivating estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). In a previous study, we showed that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of serine 305 (S305) of ERalpha results in resistance to tamoxifen. Now, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of S305 in ERalpha by PKA leads to an altered orientation between ERalpha and its coactivator SRC-1, which renders the transcription complex active in the presence of tamoxifen. This altered orientation involves the C-termini of ERalpha and SRC-1, which required a prolonged AF-1-mediated interaction. This intermolecular reorientation as a result of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ERalpha-S305 and tamoxifen binding provides a unique model for resistance to the anticancer drug tamoxifen."
19709400,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Transmembrane mucins Hkr1 and Msb2 are putative osmosensors in the SHO1 branch of yeast HOG pathway.,"To cope with life-threatening high osmolarity, yeast activates the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway, whose core element is the Hog1 MAP kinase cascade. Activated Hog1 regulates the cell cycle, protein translation, and gene expression. Upstream of the HOG pathway are functionally redundant SLN1 and SHO1 signaling branches. However, neither the osmosensor nor the signal generator of the SHO1 branch has been clearly defined. Here, we show that the mucin-like transmembrane proteins Hkr1 and Msb2 are the potential osmosensors for the SHO1 branch. Hyperactive forms of Hkr1 and Msb2 can activate the HOG pathway only in the presence of Sho1, whereas a hyperactive Sho1 mutant activates the HOG pathway in the absence of both Hkr1 and Msb2, indicating that Hkr1 and Msb2 are the most upstream elements known so far in the SHO1 branch. Hkr1 and Msb2 individually form a complex with Sho1, and, upon high external osmolarity stress, appear to induce Sho1 to generate an intracellular signal. Furthermore, Msb2, but not Hkr1, can also generate an intracellular signal in a Sho1-independent manner."
19709416,0,Science,404511,2007,Mechanism of two classes of cancer mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit.,"Many human cancers involve up-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3Kalpha, with oncogenic mutations identified in both the p110alpha catalytic and the p85alpha regulatory subunits. We used crystallographic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into activating mutations in two noncatalytic p110alpha domains-the adaptor-binding and the helical domains. A structure of the adaptor-binding domain of p110alpha in a complex with the p85alpha inter-Src homology 2 (inter-SH2) domain shows that oncogenic mutations in the adaptor-binding domain are not at the inter-SH2 interface but in a polar surface patch that is a plausible docking site for other domains in the holo p110/p85 complex. We also examined helical domain mutations and found that the Glu545 to Lys545 (E545K) oncogenic mutant disrupts an inhibitory charge-charge interaction with the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain. These studies extend our understanding of the architecture of PI3Ks and provide insight into how two classes of mutations that cause a gain in function can lead to cancer."
19710014,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,The receptor-like kinase SERK3/BAK1 is a central regulator of innate immunity in plants.,"In pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI), plant cell surface receptors sense potential microbial pathogens by recognizing elicitors called PAMPs. Although diverse PAMPs trigger PTI through distinct receptors, the resulting intracellular responses overlap extensively. Despite this, a common component(s) linking signal perception with transduction remains unknown. In this study, we identify SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK)3/brassinosteroid-associated kinase (BAK)1, a receptor-like kinase previously implicated in hormone signaling, as a component of plant PTI. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSERK3/BAK1 rapidly enters an elicitor-dependent complex with FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2), the receptor for the bacterial PAMP flagellin and its peptide derivative flg22. In the absence of AtSERK3/BAK1, early flg22-dependent responses are greatly reduced in both A. thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, N. benthamiana Serk3/Bak1 is required for full responses to unrelated PAMPs and, importantly, for restriction of bacterial and oomycete infections. Thus, SERK3/BAK1 appears to integrate diverse perception events into downstream PAMP responses, leading to immunity against a range of invading microbes."
19710023,1,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Interaction of herpes simplex virus RNase with VP16 and VP22 is required for the accumulation of the protein but not for accumulation of mRNA.,"The virion host shutoff (vhs) protein encoded by the U(L)41 gene of herpes simplex virus 1 is an endoribonuclease. The enzyme is introduced into the cell during unpackaging of the virion upon entry and selectively degrades mRNA for several hours. The RNase activity ceases after the onset of synthesis of late (gamma) viral proteins. Here we report that vhs protein does not accumulate in cells transiently transfected with only a plasmid encoding the U(L)41 gene. However, vhs does accumulate in cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing two other tegument proteins, VP16 and VP22. vhs does not directly interact with VP22 but, instead, binds VP22 only in the presence of VP16. In contrast to these findings, the amounts of vhs mRNA accumulating in the cells transfected solely with vhs are not significantly different from those detected in cells coexpressing vhs, VP16, and VP22. We conclude from these studies that the steady state of vhs mRNA, reflecting synthesis and turnover of mRNA, is not affected by the interaction of vhs protein with VP16 with VP22. A model is proposed in which the vhs protein may function to sequester mRNAs in compartments inaccessible to the cellular translational machinery and that VP16 and VP22 rescue the mRNAs by interacting with the vhs protein."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Functional specialization of beta-arrestin interactions revealed by proteomic analysis.,"Beta-arrestins are cytosolic proteins that form complexes with seven-transmembrane receptors after agonist stimulation and phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases. They play an essential role in receptor desensitization and endocytosis, and they also serve as receptor-regulated signaling scaffolds and adaptors. Moreover, in the past decade, a growing list of protein-protein interactions of beta-arrestins pertinent to these functions has been documented. The discovery of several novel functions of beta-arrestins stimulated us to perform a global proteomics analysis of beta-arrestin-interacting proteins (interactome) as modulated by a model seven-transmembrane receptor, the angiotensin II type 1a receptor, in an attempt to assess the full range of functions of these versatile molecules. As determined by LC tandem MS, 71 proteins interacted with beta-arrestin 1, 164 interacted with beta-arrestin 2, and 102 interacted with both beta-arrestins. Some proteins bound only after agonist stimulation, whereas others dissociated. Bioinformatics analysis of the data indicates that proteins involved in cellular signaling, organization, and nucleic acid binding are the most highly represented in the beta-arrestin interactome. Surprisingly, both S-arrestin (visual arrestin) and X-arrestin (cone arrestin) were also found in heteromeric complex with beta-arrestins. The beta-arrestin interactors distribute not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus as well as other subcellular compartments. The binding of 16 randomly selected newly identified beta-arrestin partners was validated by coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293 cells. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of proteins that bind beta-arrestin isoforms and underscores their potentially broad regulatory roles in mammalian cellular physiology."
19710301,0,J. Cell Biol.,375356,2007,UXT is a novel and essential cofactor in the NF-kappaB transcriptional enhanceosome.,"As a latent transcription factor, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon stimulation and mediates the expression of genes that are important in immunity, inflammation, and development. However, little is known about how it is regulated inside the nucleus. By a two-hybrid approach, we identify a prefoldin-like protein, ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), that is expressed predominantly and interacts specifically with NF-kappaB inside the nucleus. RNA interference knockdown of UXT leads to impaired NF-kappaB activity and dramatically attenuates the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes. This interference also sensitizes cells to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, UXT forms a dynamic complex with NF-kappaB and is recruited to the NF-kappaB enhanceosome upon stimulation. Interestingly, the UXT protein level correlates with constitutive NF-kappaB activity in human prostate cancer cell lines. The presence of NF-kappaB within the nucleus of stimulated or constitutively active cells is considerably diminished with decreased endogenous UXT levels. Our results reveal that UXT is an integral component of the NF-kappaB enhanceosome and is essential for its nuclear function, which uncovers a new mechanism of NF-kappaB regulation."
19710464,0,Genome Biol.,100960660,2007,A proteome-wide protein interaction map for Campylobacter jejuni.,"BACKGROUND: Data from large-scale protein interaction screens for humans and model eukaryotes have been invaluable for developing systems-level models of biological processes. Despite this value, only a limited amount of interaction data is available for prokaryotes. Here we report the systematic identification of protein interactions for the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne pathogen and a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. RESULTS: Using high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens we detected and reproduced 11,687 interactions. The resulting interaction map includes 80% of the predicted C. jejuni NCTC11168 proteins and places a large number of poorly characterized proteins into networks that provide initial clues about their functions. We used the map to identify a number of conserved subnetworks by comparison to protein networks from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also demonstrate the value of the interactome data for mapping biological pathways by identifying the C. jejuni chemotaxis pathway. Finally, the interaction map also includes a large subnetwork of putative essential genes that may be used to identify potential new antimicrobial drug targets for C. jejuni and related organisms. CONCLUSION: The C. jejuni protein interaction map is one of the most comprehensive yet determined for a free-living organism and nearly doubles the binary interactions available for the prokaryotic kingdom. This high level of coverage facilitates pathway mapping and function prediction for a large number of C. jejuni proteins as well as orthologous proteins from other organisms. The broad coverage also facilitates cross-species comparisons for the identification of evolutionarily conserved subnetworks of protein interactions."
19710541,0,BioTechniques,8306785,2007,Yeast split-ubiquitin-based cytosolic screening system to detect interactions between transcriptionally active proteins.,"Interactions between proteins are central to most biological processes; consequently, understanding the latter requires identification of all possible protein interactions within a cell. To extend the range of existing assays for the detection of protein interactions, we present a novel genetic screening assay, the cytosolic yeast two-hybrid system (cytoY2H), which is based on the split-ubiquitin technique and detects protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm. We show that the assay can be applied to a wide range of proteins that are difficult to study in the classical yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, including transcription factors such as p53 and members of the NF-kappaB complex. Furthermore, we applied the cytoY2H system to cDNA library screening and identified several new interaction partners of Uri1p, an uncharacterized yeast protein. The cytoY2H system extends existing methods for the detection of protein interactions by providing a convenient solution for screening a wide range of transcriptionally active proteins."
19710653,0,Dev. Cell,101120028,2007,A CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase containing three FEM proteins degrades TRA-1 to regulate C. elegans sex determination.,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Gli-family transcription factor TRA-1 is the terminal effector of the sex-determination pathway. TRA-1 activity inhibits male development and allows female fates. Genetic studies have indicated that TRA-1 is negatively regulated by the fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3 genes. However, the mechanism of this regulation has not been understood. Here, we present data that TRA-1 is regulated by degradation mediated by a CUL-2-based ubiquitin ligase complex that contains FEM-1 as the substrate-recognition subunit, and FEM-2 and FEM-3 as cofactors. CUL-2 physically associates with both FEM-1 and TRA-1 in vivo, and cul-2 mutant males share feminization phenotypes with fem mutants. CUL-2 and the FEM proteins negatively regulate TRA-1 protein levels in C. elegans. When expressed in human cells, the FEM proteins interact with human CUL2 and induce the proteasome-dependent degradation of TRA-1. This work demonstrates that the terminal step in C. elegans sex determination is controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis."
19710923,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,Structural basis of PP2A inhibition by small t antigen.,"The SV40 small t antigen (ST) is a potent oncoprotein that perturbs the function of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). ST directly interacts with the PP2A scaffolding A subunit and alters PP2A activity by displacing regulatory B subunits from the A subunit. We have determined the crystal structure of full-length ST in complex with PP2A A subunit at 3.1 A resolution. ST consists of an N-terminal J domain and a C-terminal unique domain that contains two zinc-binding motifs. Both the J domain and second zinc-binding motif interact with the intra-HEAT-repeat loops of HEAT repeats 3-7 of the A subunit, which overlaps with the binding site of the PP2A B56 subunit. Intriguingly, the first zinc-binding motif is in a position that may allow it to directly interact with and inhibit the phosphatase activity of the PP2A catalytic C subunit. These observations provide a structural basis for understanding the oncogenic functions of ST."
19712682,1,BMC Struct. Biol.,101088689,2007,Crystal structure of vaccinia virus uracil-DNA glycosylase reveals dimeric assembly.,"BACKGROUND: Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) catalyze excision of uracil from DNA. Vaccinia virus, which is the prototype of poxviruses, encodes a UDG (vvUDG) that is significantly different from the UDGs of other organisms in primary, secondary and tertiary structure and characteristic motifs. It adopted a novel catalysis-independent role in DNA replication that involves interaction with a viral protein, A20, to form the processivity factor. UDG:A20 association is essential for assembling of the processive DNA polymerase complex. The structure of the protein must have provisions for such interactions with A20. This paper provides the first glimpse into the structure of a poxvirus UDG. RESULTS: Results of dynamic light scattering experiments and native size exclusion chromatography showed that vvUDG is a dimer in solution. The dimeric assembly is also maintained in two crystal forms. The core of vvUDG is reasonably well conserved but the structure contains one additional beta-sheet at each terminus. A glycerol molecule is found in the active site of the enzyme in both crystal forms. Interaction of this glycerol molecule with the protein possibly mimics the enzyme-substrate (uracil) interactions. CONCLUSION: The crystal structures reveal several distinctive features of vvUDG. The new structural features may have evolved for adopting novel functions in the replication machinery of poxviruses. The mode of interaction between the subunits in the dimers suggests a possible model for binding to its partner and the nature of the processivity factor in the polymerase complex."
19713212,0,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,Human SFMBT is a transcriptional repressor protein that selectively binds the N-terminal tail of histone H3.,"Human SFMBT (hSFMBT) is postulated to be a Polycomb (PcG) protein. Similar to other PcG proteins, we found that hSFMBT displays robust transcriptional repressor activity. In addition, hSFMBT localized to the nucleus where it strongly associates with chromatin by directly and selectively binding the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Importantly, we discovered that the four tandem MBT repeats of hSFMBT were sufficient for nuclear matrix-association, N-terminal tail H3 binding, and required for transcriptional repression. These findings indicate that the tandem MBT repeats form a functional structure required for biological activity of hSFMBT and predict similar properties for other MBT domain-containing proteins."
19713438,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Involvement of the ubiquitin-like domain of TBK1/IKK-i kinases in regulation of IFN-inducible genes.,"TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1/NAK/T2K) and I-kappaB Kinase (IKK-i/IKK-epsilon) play important roles in the regulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes during the immune response to bacterial and viral infections. Cell stimulation with ssRNA virus, dsDNA virus or gram-negative bacteria leads to activation of TBK1 or IKK-i, which in turn phosphorylates the transcription factors, IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, promoting their translocation in the nucleus. To understand the molecular basis of activation of TBK1, we analyzed the sequence of TBK1 and IKK-i and identified a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) adjacent to their kinase domains. Deletion or mutations of the ULD in TBK1 or IKK-i impaired activation of respective kinases, failed to induce IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear localization and to activate IFN-beta or RANTES promoters. The importance of the ULD of TBK1 in LPS- or poly(I:C)-stimulated IFN-beta production was demonstrated by reconstitution experiments in TBK1-IKK-i-deficient cells. We propose that the ULD is a regulatory component of the TBK1/IKK-i kinases involved in the control of the kinase activation, substrate presentation and downstream signaling pathways."
19713962,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The Caenorhabditis elegans septin complex is nonpolar.,"Septins are conserved GTPases that form heteromultimeric complexes and assemble into filaments that play a critical role in cell division and polarity. Results from budding and fission yeast indicate that septin complexes form around a tetrameric core. However, the molecular structure of the core and its influence on the polarity of septin complexes and filaments is poorly defined. The septin complex of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is formed entirely by the core septins UNC-59 and UNC-61. We show that UNC-59 and UNC-61 form a dimer of coiled-coil-mediated heterodimers. By electron microscopy, this heterotetramer appears as a linear arrangement of four densities representing the four septin subunits. Fusion of GFP to the N termini of UNC-59 and UNC-61 and subsequent electron microscopic visualization suggests that the sequence of septin subunits is UNC-59/UNC-61/UNC-61/UNC-59. Visualization of GFP extensions fused to the extremity of the C-terminal coiled coils indicates that these extend laterally from the heterotetrameric core. Together, our study establishes that the septin core complex is symmetric, and suggests that septins form nonpolar filaments."
19714212,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Inhibition of c-Myc activity by ribosomal protein L11.,"The c-Myc oncoprotein promotes cell growth by enhancing ribosomal biogenesis through upregulation of RNA polymerases I-, II-, and III-dependent transcription. Overexpression of c-Myc and aberrant ribosomal biogenesis leads to deregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis. Hence, c-Myc activity and ribosomal biogenesis must be regulated in cells. Here, we show that ribosomal protein L11, a component of the large subunit of the ribosome, controls c-Myc function through a negative feedback mechanism. L11 is transcriptionally induced by c-Myc, and overexpression of L11 inhibits c-Myc-induced transcription and cell proliferation. Conversely, reduction of endogenous L11 by siRNA increases these c-Myc activities. Mechanistically, L11 binds to the Myc box II (MB II), inhibits the recruitment of the coactivator TRRAP, and reduces histone H4 acetylation at c-Myc target gene promoters. In response to serum stimulation or serum starvation, L11 and TRRAP display inverse promoter-binding profiles. In addition, L11 regulates c-Myc levels. These results identify L11 as a feedback inhibitor of c-Myc and suggest a novel role for L11 in regulating c-Myc-enhanced ribosomal biogenesis."
19716228,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,"PtdIns(4,5)P-restricted plasma membrane localization of FAN is involved in TNF-induced actin reorganization.","The WD-repeat protein factor associated with nSMase activity (FAN) is a member of the family of TNF receptor adaptor proteins that are coupled to specific signaling cascades. However, the precise functional involvement of FAN in specific cellular TNF responses remain unclear. Here, we report the involvement of FAN in TNF-induced actin reorganization and filopodia formation mediated by activation of Cdc42. The pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of FAN specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P), which targets FAN to the plasma membrane. Site-specific mutagenesis revealed that the ability of FAN to mediate filopodia formation was blunted either by the destruction of the PtdIns(4,5)P binding motif, or by the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the PH domain and the adjacent beige and Chediak-Higashi (BEACH) domain. Furthermore, FAN was shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton in TNF-stimulated cells via direct filamentous actin (F-actin) binding. The results of this study suggest that PH-mediated plasma membrane targeting of FAN is critically involved in TNF-induced Cdc42 activation and cytoskeleton reorganization."

U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Csrp1 regulates dynamic cell movements of the mesendoderm and cardiac mesoderm through interactions with Dishevelled and Diversin.,"Zebrafish Csrp1 is a member of the cysteine- and glycine-rich protein (CSRP) family and is expressed in the mesendoderm and its derivatives. Csrp1 interacts with Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) and Diversin (Div), which control cell morphology and other dynamic cell behaviors via the noncanonical Wnt and JNK pathways. When csrp1 message is knocked down, abnormal convergent extension cell movement is induced, resulting in severe deformities in midline structures. In addition, cardiac bifida is induced as a consequence of defects in cardiac mesoderm cell migration. Our data highlight Csrp1 as a key molecule of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which orchestrates cell behaviors during dynamic morphogenetic movements of tissues and organs."
19716786,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,Autoinhibition of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor by the juxtamembrane region.,"The juxtamembrane (JM) regions of several receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in autoinhibitory interactions that maintain the low basal activity of the receptors; mutations can give rise to constitutive kinase activity and signaling. In this report, we show that the JM region of the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) plays a role in kinase regulation. We mutated JM residues that were conserved in this subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and expressed and purified the cytoplasmic domains using the Sf9/baculovirus system. We show that a kinase-proximal mutation (Y957F) and (to a lesser extent) a mutation in the central part of the JM region (N947A) increase the autophosphorylation activity of the kinase. Steady-state kinetic measurements show the mutations cause an increase in V(max) for phosphorylation of peptide substrates. When the holoreceptors were expressed in fibroblasts derived from IGF1R-deficient mice, the Y957F mutation led to a large increase in basal and in IGF1-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. Together, these data demonstrate that the JM region of IGF1R plays an important role in limiting the basal activity of the receptor."
19717225,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The FANCJ/MutLalpha interaction is required for correction of the cross-link response in FA-J cells.,"FANCJ also called BACH1/BRIP1 was first linked to hereditary breast cancer through its direct interaction with BRCA1. FANCJ was also recently identified as a Fanconi anemia (FA) gene product, establishing FANCJ as an essential tumor suppressor. Similar to other FA cells, FANCJ-null (FA-J) cells accumulate 4N DNA content in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). This accumulation is corrected by reintroduction of wild-type FANCJ. Here, we show that FANCJ interacts with the mismatch repair complex MutLalpha, composed of PMS2 and MLH1. Specifically, FANCJ directly interacts with MLH1 independent of BRCA1, through its helicase domain. Genetic studies reveal that FANCJ helicase activity and MLH1 binding, but not BRCA1 binding, are essential to correct the FA-J cells' ICL-induced 4N DNA accumulation and sensitivity to ICLs. These results suggest that the FANCJ/MutLalpha interaction, but not FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction, is essential for establishment of a normal ICL-induced response. The functional role of the FANCJ/MutLalpha complex demonstrates a novel link between FA and MMR, and predicts a broader role for FANCJ in DNA damage signaling independent of BRCA1."
19717429,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Crystal structure and mutational study of RecOR provide insight into its mode of DNA binding.,"The crystal structure of the complex formed between Deinococcus radiodurans RecR and RecO (drRecOR) has been determined. In accordance with previous biochemical characterisation, the drRecOR complex displays a RecR:RecO molecular ratio of 2:1. The biologically relevant drRecOR entity consists of a heterohexamer in the form of two drRecO molecules positioned on either side of the tetrameric ring of drRecR, with their OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) domains pointing towards the interior of the ring. Mutagenesis studies validated the protein-protein interactions observed in the crystal structure and allowed mapping of the residues in the drRecOR complex required for DNA binding. Furthermore, the preferred DNA substrate of drRecOR was identified as being 3'-overhanging DNA, as encountered at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions. Together these results suggest a possible mechanism for drRecOR recognition of stalled replication forks."
19717438,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,C-reactive protein collaborates with plasma lectins to boost immune response against bacteria.,"Although human C-reactive protein (CRP) becomes upregulated during septicemia, its role remains unclear, since purified CRP showed no binding to many common pathogens. Contrary to previous findings, we show that purified human CRP (hCRP) binds to Salmonella enterica, and that binding is enhanced in the presence of plasma factors. In the horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, CRP is a major hemolymph protein. Incubation of hemolymph with a range of bacteria resulted in CRP binding to all the bacteria tested. Lipopolysaccharide-affinity chromatography of the hemolymph co-purified CRP, galactose-binding protein (GBP) and carcinolectin-5 (CL5). Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays suggested that these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) form pathogen recognition complexes. We show the conservation of PRR crosstalk in humans, whereby hCRP interacts with ficolin (CL5 homologue). This interaction stabilizes CRP binding to bacteria and activates the lectin-mediated complement pathway. We propose that CRP does not act alone but collaborates with other plasma PRRs to form stable pathogen recognition complexes when targeting a wide range of bacteria for destruction."
19717453,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The p110delta isoform of PI 3-kinase negatively controls RhoA and PTEN.,"Inactivation of PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling is critical for tumour suppression by PTEN. This is thought to be a unidirectional relationship in which PTEN degrades the lipids produced by PI3K, thus controlling cell proliferation, survival and migration. We now show that this relationship is in fact bidirectional, whereby PI3K reciprocally controls PTEN. We report that the p110delta PI3K negatively regulates PTEN, through a pathway involving inhibition of RhoA. Inactivation of p110delta in macrophages led to reduced Akt and Rac1 activation, but paradoxically to increased RhoA and PTEN activity. Partial inactivation of p190RhoGAP and a reduced binding of cytoplasmic RhoA to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 both contributed to the increased RhoA-GTP levels upon p110delta inactivation. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK, a downstream effector kinase of RhoA, restored all signalling and functional defects of p110delta inactivation, including Akt phosphorylation, chemotaxis and proliferation. This work identifies the RhoA/ROCK pathway as a major target of p110delta-mediated PI3K signalling, and establishes for the first time that PI3K controls itself, via a feedback loop involving PTEN."
19717606,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Latent TGF-beta-binding protein 2 binds to DANCE/fibulin-5 and regulates elastic fiber assembly.,"Elastic fibers play the principal roles in providing elasticity and integrity to various types of human organs, such as the arteries, lung, and skin. However, the molecular mechanism of elastic fiber assembly that leads to deposition and crosslinking of elastin along microfibrils remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that developing arteries and neural crest EGF-like protein (DANCE) (also designated fibulin-5) is essential for elastogenesis by studying DANCE-deficient mice. Here, we report the identification of latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein 2 (LTBP-2), an elastic fiber-associating protein whose function in elastogenesis is not clear, as a DANCE-binding protein. Elastogenesis assays using human skin fibroblasts reveal that fibrillar deposition of DANCE and elastin is largely dependent on fibrillin-1 microfibrils. However, downregulation of LTBP-2 induces fibrillin-1-independent fibrillar deposition of DANCE and elastin. Moreover, recombinant LTBP-2 promotes deposition of DANCE onto fibrillin-1 microfibrils. These results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of elastic fiber assembly in which LTBP-2 regulates targeting of DANCE on suitable microfibrils to form elastic fibers."
19718025,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Structure of the APPL1 BAR-PH domain and characterization of its interaction with Rab5.,"APPL1 is an effector of the small GTPase Rab5. Together, they mediate a signal transduction pathway initiated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors. Interaction with Rab5 is confined to the amino (N)-terminal region of APPL1. We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N-terminal BAR-PH domain motif. The BAR and PH domains, together with a novel linker helix, form an integrated, crescent-shaped, symmetrical dimer. This BAR-PH interaction is likely conserved in the class of BAR-PH containing proteins. Biochemical analyses indicate two independent Rab-binding sites located at the opposite ends of the dimer, where the PH domain directly interacts with Rab5 and Rab21. Besides structurally supporting the PH domain, the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding through a small surface region in the vicinity of the PH domain. In stark contrast to the helix-dominated, Rab-binding domains previously reported, APPL1 PH domain employs beta-strands to interact with Rab5. On the Rab5 side, both switch regions are involved in the interaction. Thus we identified a new binding mode between PH domains and small GTPases."
19718039,1,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,PINK1 protects against oxidative stress by phosphorylating mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1.,"Mutations in the PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson disease (PD). So far, no substrates of PINK1 have been reported, and the mechanism by which PINK1 mutations lead to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we report the identification of TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone also known as heat shock protein 75 (Hsp75), as a cellular substrate for PINK1 kinase. PINK1 binds and colocalizes with TRAP1 in the mitochondria and phosphorylates TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. We show that PINK1 protects against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and this protective action of PINK1 depends on its kinase activity to phosphorylate TRAP1. Moreover, we find that the ability of PINK1 to promote TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival is impaired by PD-linked PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations. Our findings suggest a novel pathway by which PINK1 phosphorylates downstream effector TRAP1 to prevent oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis and implicate the dysregulation of this mitochondrial pathway in PD pathogenesis."
19718685,0,Genes Dev.,8711660,2007,Regulation of plant innate immunity by three proteins in a complex conserved across the plant and animal kingdoms.,"Innate immunity against pathogen infection is an evolutionarily conserved process among multicellular organisms. Arabidopsis SNC1 encodes a Resistance protein that combines attributes of multiple mammalian pattern recognition receptors. Utilizing snc1 as an autoimmune model, we identified a discrete protein complex containing at least three members--MOS4 (Modifier Of snc1, 4), AtCDC5, and PRL1 (Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1)--that are all essential for plant innate immunity. AtCDC5 has DNA-binding activity, suggesting that this complex probably regulates defense responses through transcriptional control. Since the complex components along with their interactions are highly conserved from fission yeast to Arabidopsis and human, they may also have a yet-to-be-identified function in mammalian innate immunity."

Tim15/Zim17/Hep1 is a mtHsp70 partner protein on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We determined the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the core domain of Tim15. On the basis of the NMR structure, we created Tim15 mutants and tested their ability to complement the functional defects of Tim15 depletion and to suppress self-aggregation of mtHsp70 in vivo. A pair of basic residues, Arg 106 and His 107, conserved Asp 111 and flexible loop 133-137, and were important (Arg 106-His 107 pair and Asp 111) or partly important (the loop 133-137) for yeast cell growth, mitochondrial protein import and the suppression of mtHsp70 aggregation. Therefore, the function of Tim15 in yeast cell growth is well correlated with its ability to suppress mtHsp70 aggregation, although it is still unknown whether inhibition of mtHsp70 aggregation is the primary function of Tim15."
19720740,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,Hedgehog restricts its expression domain in the Drosophila wing.,"The stable subdivision of Drosophila limbs into anterior and posterior compartments is a consequence of asymmetrical signalling by Hedgehog (Hh), from the posterior to anterior cells. The activity of the homeodomain protein Engrailed in posterior cells helps to generate this asymmetry by inducing the expression of Hh in the posterior compartment and, at the same time, repressing the expression of the essential downstream component Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Therefore, only anterior cells that receive the Hh signal across the compartment boundary will respond by stabilizing Ci. Here, we describe a new molecular mechanism that helps to maintain the Hh-expressing and Hh-responding cells in different non-overlapping cell populations. Master of thickveins (mtv) - a target of Hh activity encoding a nuclear zinc-finger protein - is required to repress hh expression in anterior cells. Mtv exerts this action in a protein complex with Groucho (Gro) - the founding member of a superfamily of transcriptional corepressors that are conserved throughout eukaryotes. Therefore, Hh restricts its own expression domain in the Drosophila wing through the activity of Mtv and Gro."
19720741,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,"SINTBAD, a novel component of innate antiviral immunity, shares a TBK1-binding domain with NAP1 and TANK.","The expression of antiviral genes during infection is controlled by inducible transcription factors such as IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor). Activation of IRF3 requires its phosphorylation by TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase) or IKKi (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB kinase, inducible). We have identified a new and essential component of this pathway, the adaptor protein SINTBAD (similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor). SINTBAD constitutively binds TBK1 and IKKi but not related kinases. Upon infection with Sendai virus, SINTBAD is essential for the efficient induction of IRF-dependent transcription, as are two further TBK1 adaptors, TANK and NAP1. We identified a conserved TBK1/IKKi-binding domain (TBD) in the three adaptors, predicted to form an alpha-helix with residues essential for kinase binding clustering on one side. Isolated TBDs compete with adaptor binding to TBK1 and prevent poly(I:C)-induced IRF-dependent transcription. Our results suggest that efficient signal transduction upon viral infection requires SINTBAD, TANK and NAP1 because they link TBK1 and IKKi to virus-activated signalling cascades."
19720840,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Foxh1 recruits Gsc to negatively regulate Mixl1 expression during early mouse development.,"Mixl1 is a member of the Mix/Bix family of paired-like homeodomain proteins and is required for proper axial mesendoderm morphogenesis and endoderm formation during mouse development. Mix/Bix proteins are transcription factors that function in Nodal-like signaling pathways and are themselves regulated by Nodal. Here, we show that Foxh1 forms a DNA-binding complex with Smads to regulate transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)/Nodal-dependent Mixl1 gene expression. Whereas Foxh1 is commonly described as a transcriptional activator, we observed that Foxh1-null embryos exhibit expanded and enhanced Mixl1 expression during gastrulation, indicating that Foxh1 negatively regulates expression of Mixl1 during early mouse embryogenesis. We demonstrate that Foxh1 associates with the homeodomain-containing protein Goosecoid (Gsc), which in turn recruits histone deacetylases to repress Mixl1 gene expression. Ectopic expression of Gsc in embryoid bodies represses endogenous Mixl1 expression and this effect is dependent on Foxh1. As Gsc is itself induced in a Foxh1-dependent manner, we propose that Foxh1 initiates positive and negative transcriptional circuits to refine cell fate decisions during gastrulation."
19720873,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Negative regulation of SEK1 signaling by serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase 1.,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase 1 (SGK1) has been implicated in diverse cellular activities including the promotion of cell survival. The molecular mechanism of the role of SGK1 in protection against cellular stress has remained unclear, however. We have now shown that SGK1 inhibits the activation of SEK1 and thereby negatively regulates the JNK signaling pathway. SGK1 was found to physically associate with SEK1 in intact cells. Furthermore, activated SGK1 mediated the phosphorylation of SEK1 on serine 78, resulting in inhibition of the binding of SEK1 to JNK1, as well as to MEKK1. Replacement of serine 78 of SEK1 with alanine abolished SGK1-mediated SEK1 inhibition. Oxidative stress upregulated SGK1 expression, and depletion of SGK1 by RNA interference potentiated the activation of SEK1 induced by oxidative stress in Rat2 fibroblasts. Moreover, such SGK1 depletion prevented the dexamethasone-induced increase in SGK1 expression, as well as the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on paclitaxel-induced SEK1-JNK signaling and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Together, our results suggest that SGK1 negatively regulates stress-activated signaling through inhibition of SEK1 function."
19720874,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,The Sch9 kinase is a chromatin-associated transcriptional activator of osmostress-responsive genes.,"The yeast Sch9 kinase has been implicated in the cellular adjustment to nutrient availability and in the regulation of aging. Here, we define a novel role for Sch9 in the transcriptional activation of osmostress inducible genes. Loss-of-function mutants sch9 are sensitive to hyperosmotic stress and show an impaired transcriptional response upon osmotic shock of several defense genes. We show that Sch9 is required for gene expression regulated by Sko1, a transcription factor, which is directly targeted by the Hog1 MAP kinase. Sch9 interacts in vitro with both Sko1 and Hog1. Additionally, Sch9 phosphorylates Sko1 in vitro. When artificially tethered to promoter DNA, Sch9 strongly activates transcription independently of osmotic stress. Using in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that Sch9 is recruited to the GRE2 and CTT1 genes exclusively under osmostress conditions, and that this recruitment is dependent on Hog1 and Sko1. Furthermore, Sch9 is required for the proper recruitment of Hog1 at the same genes. Our data reveal the complexity of stress-induced transcription by the regulated association of signaling kinases to chromatin."
19720959,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Structural basis of the recognition of a methylated histone tail by JMJD2A.,"The Jumonji C domain is a catalytic motif that mediates histone lysine demethylation. The Jumonji C-containing oxygenase JMJD2A specifically demethylates tri- and dimethylated lysine-9 and lysine-36 of histone 3 (H3K9/36 me3/2). Here we present structures of the JMJD2A catalytic core complexed with methylated H3K36 peptide substrates in the presence of Fe(II) and N-oxalylglycine. We found that the interaction between JMJD2A and peptides largely involves the main chains of the enzyme and the peptide. The peptide-binding specificity is primarily determined by the primary structure of the peptide, which explains the specificity of JMJD2A for methylated H3K9 and H3K36 instead of other methylated residues such as H3K27. The specificity for a particular methyl group, however, is affected by multiple factors, such as space and the electrostatic environment in the catalytic center of the enzyme. These results provide insights into the mechanisms and specificity of histone demethylation."

Chem.,2985121R,2007,P-Rex1 links mammalian target of rapamycin signaling to Rac activation and cell migration.,"Polarized cell migration results from the transduction of extra-cellular cues promoting the activation of Rho GTPases with the intervention of multidomain proteins, including guanine exchange factors. P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are Rac GEFs connecting Gbetagamma and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling to Rac activation. Their complex architecture suggests their regulation by protein-protein interactions. Novel mechanisms of activation of Rho GTPases are associated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase known as a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Recently, two independent multiprotein complexes containing mTOR have been described. mTORC1 links to the classical rapamycin-sensitive pathways relevant for protein synthesis; mTORC2 links to the activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal events via undefined mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 establish, through their tandem DEP domains, interactions with mTOR, suggesting their potential as effectors in the signaling of mTOR to Rac activation and cell migration. This possibility was consistent with the effect of dominant-negative constructs and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of P-Rex1, which decreased mTOR-dependent leucine-induced activation of Rac and cell migration. Rapamycin, a widely used inhibitor of mTOR signaling, did not inhibit Rac activity and cell migration induced by leucine, indicating that P-Rex1, which we found associated to both mTOR complexes, is only active when in the mTORC2 complex. mTORC2 has been described as the catalytic complex that phosphorylates AKT/PKB at Ser-473 and elicits activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal reorganization. Thus, P-Rex1 links mTOR signaling to Rac activation and cell migration."
19720999,0,Structure,101087697,2007,Structure of synaptophysin: a hexameric MARVEL-domain channel protein.,"Synaptophysin I (SypI) is an archetypal member of the MARVEL-domain family of integral membrane proteins and one of the first synaptic vesicle proteins to be identified and cloned. Most all MARVEL-domain proteins are involved in membrane apposition and vesicle-trafficking events, but their precise role in these processes is unclear. We have purified mammalian SypI and determined its three-dimensional (3D) structure by using electron microscopy and single-particle 3D reconstruction. The hexameric structure resembles an open basket with a large pore and tenuous interactions within the cytosolic domain. The structure suggests a model for Synaptophysin's role in fusion and recycling that is regulated by known interactions with the SNARE machinery. This 3D structure of a MARVEL-domain protein provides a structural foundation for understanding the role of these important proteins in a variety of biological processes."
19722188,1,Structure,101087697,2007,Structure and rearrangements in the carboxy-terminal region of SpIH channels.,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) ion channels regulate the spontaneous firing activity and electrical excitability of many cardiac and neuronal cells. The modulation of HCN channel opening by the direct binding of cAMP underlies many physiological processes such as the autonomic regulation of the heart rate. Here we use a combination of X-ray crystallography and electrophysiology to study the allosteric mechanism for cAMP modulation of HCN channels. SpIH is an invertebrate HCN channel that is activated fully by cAMP, but only partially by cGMP. We exploited the partial agonist action of cGMP on SpIH to reveal the molecular mechanism for cGMP specificity of many cyclic nucleotide-regulated enzymes. Our results also elaborate a mechanism for the allosteric conformational change in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and a mechanism for partial agonist action. These mechanisms will likely extend to other cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels and enzymes as well."
19722592,0,Cancer Cell,101130617,2007,Structural basis for recognition of SMRT/N-CoR by the MYND domain and its contribution to AML1/ETO's activity.,"AML1/ETO results from the t(8;21) associated with 12%-15% of acute myeloid leukemia. The AML1/ETO MYND domain mediates interactions with the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR and contributes to AML1/ETO's ability to repress proliferation and differentiation of primary bone marrow cells as well as to enhance their self renewal in vitro. We solved the solution structure of the MYND domain and show it to be structurally homologous to the PHD and RING finger families of proteins. We also determined the solution structure of an MYND-SMRT peptide complex. We demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution that disrupts the interaction between the MYND domain and the SMRT peptide attenuated AML1/ETO's effects on proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression."
19722593,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,The role of LANP and ataxin 1 in E4F-mediated transcriptional repression.,"The leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP) belongs to the INHAT family of corepressors that inhibits histone acetyltransferases. The mechanism by which LANP restricts its repression to specific genes is unknown. Here, we report that LANP forms a complex with transcriptional repressor E4F and modulates its activity. As LANP interacts with ataxin 1--a protein mutated in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)--we tested whether ataxin 1 can alter the E4F-LANP interaction. We show that ataxin 1 relieves the transcriptional repression induced by the LANP-E4F complex by competing with E4F for LANP. These results provide the first functional link, to our knowledge, between LANP and ataxin 1, and indicate a potential mechanism for the transcriptional aberrations observed in SCA1."
19722653,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,"Drosophila Omi, a mitochondrial-localized IAP antagonist and proapoptotic serine protease.","Although essential in mammals, in flies the importance of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization for apoptosis remains highly controversial. Herein, we demonstrate that Drosophila Omi (dOmi), a fly homologue of the serine protease Omi/HtrA2, is a developmentally regulated mitochondrial intermembrane space protein that undergoes processive cleavage, in situ, to generate two distinct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) binding motifs. Depending upon the proapoptotic stimulus, mature dOmi is then differentially released into the cytosol, where it binds selectively to the baculovirus IAP repeat 2 (BIR2) domain in Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1) and displaces the initiator caspase DRONC. This interaction alone, however, is insufficient to promote apoptosis, as dOmi fails to displace the effector caspase DrICE from the BIR1 domain in DIAP1. Rather, dOmi alleviates DIAP1 inhibition of all caspases by proteolytically degrading DIAP1 and induces apoptosis both in cultured cells and in the developing fly eye. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time in flies that mitochondrial permeabilization not only occurs during apoptosis but also results in the release of a bona fide proapoptotic protein."
19722658,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Selective redox regulation of cytokine receptor signaling by extracellular thioredoxin-1.,"The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is known to be secreted by leukocytes and to exhibit cytokine-like properties. Extracellular effects of Trx1 require a functional active site, suggesting a redox-based mechanism of action. However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals. Furthermore, we confirm that Trx1 affects CD30-dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. Thus, we conclude that receptor-ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst."
19722664,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,"Interaction of integrin-linked kinase with the kidney chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, kAE1.","Kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) mediates chloride/bicarbonate exchange at the basolateral membrane of kidney alpha-intercalated cells, thereby facilitating bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. Human kAE1 lacks the N-terminal 65 residues of the erythroid form (AE1, band 3), which are essential for binding of cytoskeletal and cytosolic proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine kinase, and an actin-binding protein as an interacting partner with the N-terminal domain of kAE1. Interaction between kAE1 and ILK was confirmed in co-expression experiments in HEK 293 cells and is mediated by a previously unidentified calponin homology domain in the kAE1 N-terminal region. The calponin homology domain of kAE1 binds the C-terminal catalytic domain of ILK to enhance association of kAE1 with the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of ILK increased kAE1 levels at the cell surface as shown by flow cytometry, cell surface biotinylation, and anion transport activity assays. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that ILK associates with kAE1 early in biosynthesis, likely in the endoplasmic reticulum. ILK co-localized with kAE1 at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and in alpha-intercalated cells of human kidneys. Taken together these results suggest that ILK and kAE1 traffic together from the endoplasmic reticulum to the basolateral membrane. ILK may provide a linkage between kAE1 and the underlying actin cytoskeleton to stabilize kAE1 at the basolateral membrane, resulting in higher levels of cell surface expression."
19723309,0,J. Biol. Chem.,2985121R,2007,AtCCMA interacts with AtCcmB to form a novel mitochondrial ABC transporter involved in cytochrome c maturation in Arabidopsis.,"ABC transporters make a large and diverse family of proteins found in all phylae. AtCCMA is the nucleotide binding domain of a novel Arabidopsis mitochondrial ABC transporter. It is encoded in the nucleus and imported into mitochondria. Sub-organellar and topology studies find AtCCMA bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane, facing the matrix. AtCCMA exhibits an ATPase activity, and ATP/Mg(2+) can facilitate its dissociation from membranes. Blue Native PAGE shows that it is part of a 480-kDa complex. Yeast two-hybrid assays reveal interactions between AtCCMA and domains of CcmB, the mitochondria-encoded transmembrane protein of a conserved ABC transporter. All these properties designate the protein as the ortholog in plant mitochondria of the bacterial CcmA required for cytochrome c maturation. The transporter that involves AtCCMA defines a new category of eukaryotic ABC proteins because its transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains are encoded by separate genomes."

Until substrate-specific PP2A holoenzymes assemble, a constitutively active, but nonspecific, catalytic C subunit would constitute a risk to the cell. While it has been assumed that the severe proliferation impairment of yeast lacking the structural PP2A subunit, TPD3, is due to the unrestricted activity of the C subunit, we recently obtained evidence for the existence of the C subunit in a low-activity conformation that requires the RRD/PTPA proteins for the switch into the active conformation. To study whether and how maturation of the C subunit is coupled with holoenzyme assembly, we analyzed PP2A biogenesis in yeast. Here we show that the generation of the catalytically active C subunit depends on the physical and functional interaction between RRD2 and the structural subunit, TPD3. The phenotype of the tpd3Delta strain is therefore caused by impaired, rather than increased, PP2A activity. TPD3/RRD2-dependent C subunit maturation is under the surveillance of the PP2A methylesterase, PPE1, which upon malfunction of PP2A biogenesis, prevents premature generation of the active C subunit and holoenzyme assembly by counteracting the untimely methylation of the C subunit. We propose a novel model of PP2A biogenesis in which a tightly controlled activation cascade protects cells from untargeted activity of the free catalytic PP2A subunit."
19723760,0,EMBO Rep.,100963049,2007,"Metabolism, cytoskeleton and cellular signalling in the grip of protein Nepsilon - and O-acetylation.","Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues (N(epsilon)-acetylation) is a reversible post-translational modification with the potential to rival phosphorylation. In addition to histones and many transcription factors such as p53, regulators of DNA repair, replication and recombination are subject to N(epsilon)-acetylation. This modification is also important for governing the activities of various enzymes, including histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, bacterial and mammalian acetyl-CoA synthases, kinases, phosphatases, the ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 and the chaperonin heat shock protein 90. Furthermore, lysine acetylation occurs in cellular structure proteins such as alpha-tubulin, actin, cortactin and p120 catenin. Strikingly, the Yersinia outer protein YopJ promotes O-acetylation of crucial serine and threonine residues that are required for activation of the MAPK/ERK kinase and IkappaB kinase families, which precludes their phosphorylation and blocks signal transduction. Thus, N(epsilon)- and O-acetylation are becoming recognized as two prominent mechanisms for regulating protein functions in diverse organisms."
19724778,1,BMC Plant Biol.,100967807,2007,Saccharomyces cerevisiae FKBP12 binds Arabidopsis thaliana TOR and its expression in plants leads to rapamycin susceptibility.,"BACKGROUND: The eukaryotic TOR pathway controls translation, growth and the cell cycle in response to environmental signals such as nutrients or growth-stimulating factors. The TOR protein kinase can be inactivated by the antibiotic rapamycin following the formation of a ternary complex between TOR, rapamycin and FKBP12 proteins. The TOR protein is also found in higher plants despite the fact that they are rapamycin insensitive. Previous findings using the yeast two hybrid system suggest that the FKBP12 plant homolog is unable to form a complex with rapamycin and TOR, while the FRB domain of plant TOR is still able to bind to heterologous FKBP12 in the presence of rapamycin. The resistance to rapamycin is therefore limiting the molecular dissection of the TOR pathway in higher plants. RESULTS: Here we show that none of the FKBPs from the model plant Arabidopsis (AtFKBPs) is able to form a ternary complex with the FRB domain of AtTOR in the presence of rapamycin in a two hybrid system. An antibody has been raised against the AtTOR protein and binding of recombinant yeast ScFKBP12 to native Arabidopsis TOR in the presence of rapamycin was demonstrated in pull-down experiments. Transgenic lines expressing ScFKBP12 were produced and were found to display a rapamycin-dependent reduction of the primary root growth and a lowered accumulation of high molecular weight polysomes. CONCLUSION: These results further strengthen the idea that plant resistance to rapamycin evolved as a consequence of mutations in plant FKBP proteins. The production of rapamycin-sensitive plants through the expression of the ScFKBP12 protein illustrates the conservation of the TOR pathway in eukaryotes. Since AtTOR null mutants were found to be embryo lethal 1, transgenic ScFKBP12 plants will provide an useful tool for the post-embryonic study of plant TOR functions. This work also establish for the first time a link between TOR activity and translation in plant cells."
19725075,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Ferroxidase activity is required for the stability of cell surface ferroportin in cells expressing GPI-ceruloplasmin.,"Ferroportin (Fpn), a ferrous iron Fe(II) transporter responsible for the entry of iron into plasma, is regulated post-translationally through internalization and degradation following binding of the hormone hepcidin. Cellular iron export is impaired in mice and humans with aceruloplasminemia, an iron overload disease due to mutations in the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (Cp). In the absence of Cp Fpn is rapidly internalized and degraded. Depletion of extracellular Fe(II) by the yeast ferroxidase Fet3p or iron chelators can maintain cell surface Fpn in the absence of Cp. Iron remains bound to Fpn in the absence of multicopper oxidases. Fpn with bound iron is recognized by a ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates Fpn on lysine 253. Mutation of lysine 253 to alanine prevents ubiquitination and maintains Fpn-iron on cell surface in the absence of ferroxidase activity. The requirement for a ferroxidase to maintain iron transport activity represents a new mechanism of regulating cellular iron export, a new function for Cp and an explanation for brain iron overload in patients with aceruloplasminemia."

By descending the genetic cascades, cells lose their pluripotent status and are determined to differentiate into distinct tissues. Mammalian Oct-3/4, a POU factor of subclass V (POU-V), is required for the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. However, its molecular function within the early embryo is yet poorly understood. We here show that the two maternal Xenopus POU-V factors, Oct-60 and Oct-25, inhibit transcription of genes activated by VegT and beta-Catenin. Maternal POU-V factors and maternal VegT show an opposite distribution along the animal/vegetal axis. Oct-25, VegT and Tcf3 interact with each other and form repression complexes on promoters of VegT and beta-Catenin target genes. We suggest that POU-V factors antagonize primary inducers to allow germ layer specification in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner."

Here, we provide evidence that in mouse brain profilin1 and profilin2 have distinct roles in regulating synaptic actin polymerization with profilin2 preferring a WAVE-complex-mediated pathway. Mice lacking profilin2 show a block in synaptic actin polymerization in response to depolarization, which is accompanied by increased synaptic excitability of glutamatergic neurons due to higher vesicle exocytosis. These alterations in neurotransmitter release correlate with a hyperactivation of the striatum and enhanced novelty-seeking behavior in profilin2 mutant mice. Our results highlight a novel, profilin2-dependent pathway, regulating synaptic physiology, neuronal excitability, and complex behavior."
19730681,1,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Truncations of amphiphysin I by calpain inhibit vesicle endocytosis during neural hyperexcitation.,"Under normal physiological conditions, synaptic vesicle endocytosis is regulated by phosphorylation and Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation of endocytic proteins such as amphiphysin and dynamin. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms that may occur under the conditions of excessive presynaptic Ca(2+) influx observed preceding neural hyperexcitation, we examined hippocampal slices following high-potassium or high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS). In both cases, three truncated forms of amphiphysin I resulted from cleavage by the protease calpain. In vitro, the binding of truncated amphiphysin I to dynamin I and copolymerization into rings with dynamin I were inhibited, but its interaction with liposomes was not affected. Moreover, overexpression of the truncated form of amphiphysin I inhibited endocytosis of transferrin and synaptic vesicles. Inhibiting calpain prevented HFS-induced depression of presynaptic transmission. Finally, calpain-dependent amphiphysin I cleavage attenuated kainate-induced seizures. These results suggest that calpain-dependent cleavage of amphiphysin I inhibits synaptic vesicle endocytosis during neural hyperexcitation and demonstrate a novel post-translational regulation of endocytosis."

Cell,9201390,2007,The nucleolar Net1/Cfi1-related protein Dnt1 antagonizes the septation initiation network in fission yeast.,"The septation initiation network (SIN) and mitotic exit network (MEN) signaling pathways regulate cytokinesis and mitotic exit in the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. One function of these pathways is to keep the Cdc14-family phosphatase, called Clp1 in S. pombe, from being sequestered and inhibited in the nucleolus. In S. pombe, the SIN and Clp1 act as part of a cytokinesis checkpoint that allows cells to cope with cytokinesis defects. The SIN promotes checkpoint function by 1) keeping Clp1 out of the nucleolus, 2) maintaining the cytokinetic apparatus, and 3) halting the cell cycle until cytokinesis is completed. In a screen for suppressors of the SIN mutant cytokinesis checkpoint defect, we identified a novel nucleolar protein called Dnt1 and other nucleolar proteins, including Rrn5 and Nuc1, which are known to be required for rDNA transcription. Dnt1 shows sequence homology to Net1/Cfi1, which encodes the nucleolar inhibitor of Cdc14 in budding yeast. Like Net1/Cfi1, Dnt1 is required for rDNA silencing and minichromosome maintenance, and both Dnt1 and Net1/Cfi1 negatively regulate the homologous SIN and MEN pathways. Unlike Net1/Cfi1, which regulates the MEN through the Cdc14 phosphatase, Dnt1 can inhibit SIN signaling independently of Clp1, suggesting a novel connection between the nucleolus and the SIN pathway."

The crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with CoREST and a substrate-like peptide inhibitor highlights an intricate network of interactions and a folded conformation of the bound peptide. The core of the peptide structure is formed by Arg(2), Gln(5), and Ser(10), which are engaged in specific intramolecular H-bonds. Several charged side chains on the surface of the substrate-binding pocket establish electrostatic interactions with the peptide. The three-dimensional structure predicts that methylated Lys(4) binds in a solvent inaccessible position in front of the flavin cofactor. This geometry is fully consistent with the demethylation reaction being catalyzed through a flavin-mediated oxidation of the substrate amino-methyl group. These features dictate the exquisite substrate specificity of LSD1 and provide a structural framework to explain the fine tuning of its catalytic activity and the active role of CoREST in substrate recognition."

Here, we show that Homo sapiens (Hs) NUF2 is required for stable kinetochore localization of centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) in HeLa cells. HsNUF2 specifies the kinetochore association of CENP-E by interacting with its C-terminal domain. The region of HsNUF2 binding to CENP-E was mapped to its C-terminal domain by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and yeast two-hybrid assays. Suppression of synthesis of HsNUF2 by small interfering RNA abrogated the localization of CENP-E to the kinetochore, demonstrating the requirement of HsNUF2 for CENP-E kinetochore localization. In addition, depletion of HsNUF2 caused aberrant chromosome segregation. These HsNUF2-suppressed cells displayed reduced tension at kinetochores of bi-orientated chromosomes. Double knockdown of CENP-E and HsNUF2 further abolished the tension at the kinetochores. Our results indicate that HsNUF2 and CENP-E are required for organization of stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment that is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis."

The C terminus of Tic40 shares weak similarity with the C-terminal Sti1 domains of the mammalian Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip) and Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop) co-chaperones. Additionally, Tic40 may possess a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein-protein interaction domain, another characteristic feature of Hip/Hop co-chaperones. To investigate the functional importance of different parts of the Tic40 protein and to determine whether the homology between Tic40 and co-chaperones is functionally significant, different Tic40 deletion and Tic40:Hip fusion constructs were generated and assessed for complementation activity in the Arabidopsis Tic40 knock-out mutant, tic40. Interestingly, all Tic40 deletion constructs failed to complement tic40, indicating that each part removed is essential for Tic40 function; these included a construct lacking the Sti1-like domain (DeltaSti1), a second lacking a central region, including the putative TPR domain (DeltaTPR), and a third lacking the predicted transmembrane anchor region. Moreover, the DeltaSti1 and DeltaTPR constructs caused strong dominant-negative, albino phenotypes in tic40 transformants, indicating that the truncated Tic40 proteins interfere with the residual chloroplast protein import that occurs in tic40 plants. Remarkably, the Tic40:Hip fusion constructs showed that the Sti1 domain of human Hip is functionally equivalent to the Sti1-like region of Tic40, strongly suggesting a co-chaperone role for the Tic40 protein. Supporting this notion, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated the in vivo interaction of Tic40 with Tic110, a protein believed to recruit stromal chaperones to protein import sites."

Overexpression of POSH induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types, but apoptosis can be prevented by co-expressing the pro-survival protein kinase Akt. We report here that POSH is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by Akt in vivo and in vitro, and we identify a major site of Akt phosphorylation as serine 304 of POSH, which lies within the Rac-binding domain. We further show that phosphorylation of POSH results in a decreased ability to bind activated Rac, as does phosphomimetic S304D and S304E mutation of POSH. S304D mutant POSH also shows a strongly reduced ability to induce apoptosis. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which Akt promotes cell survival."

We show here that a heat pulse also mediates this interaction, and heat-induced phase shifts are severely reduced in the cryptochrome loss-of-function mutant cry(b). The period mutant per(L) manifests a comparable CRY dependence and dramatically enhanced temperature sensitivity of biochemical interactions and behavioral phase shifting. Remarkably, CRY is also critical for most of the abnormal temperature compensation of per(L) flies, because a per(L); cry(b) strain manifests nearly normal temperature compensation. Finally, light and temperature act together to affect rhythms in wild-type flies. The results indicate a role for CRY in circadian temperature as well as light regulation and suggest that these two features of the external 24-h cycle normally act together to dictate circadian phase."

Here, we show that Bim-/- fibroblasts and epithelial cells exhibit reduced cell death following serum withdrawal in comparison with their wild-type counterparts. In viable cells, Bax associates with Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. Upon serum withdrawal, newly expressed Bim(EL) associates with Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, coinciding with the dissociation of Bax from these proteins. Survival factors can prevent association of Bim with pro-survival proteins by preventing Bim expression. However, we now show that even preformed Bim(EL)/Mcl-1 and Bim(EL)/Bcl-x(L) complexes can be rapidly dissociated following activation of ERK1/2 by survival factors. The dissociation of Bim from Mcl-1 is specific for Bim(EL) and requires ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Bim(EL) at Ser(65). Finally, ERK1/2-dependent dissociation of Bim(EL) from Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) may play a role in regulating Bim(EL) degradation, since mutations in the Bim(EL) BH3 domain that disrupt binding to Mcl-1 cause increased turnover of Bim(EL). These results provide new insights into the role of Bim in cell death and its regulation by the ERK1/2 survival pathway."
19763166,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,"p140Cap protein suppresses tumour cell properties, regulating Csk and Src kinase activity.","We recently identified p140Cap as a novel adaptor protein, expressed in epithelial-rich tissues and phosphorylated upon cell matrix adhesion and growth factor treatment. Here, we characterise p140Cap as a novel Src-binding protein, which regulates Src activation via C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). p140Cap silencing increases cell spreading, migration rate and Src kinase activity. Accordingly, increased expression of p140Cap activates Csk, leading to inhibition of Src and downstream signalling as well as of cell motility and invasion. Moreover, cell proliferation and &quot;in vivo&quot; breast cancer cell growth are strongly impaired by high levels of p140Cap, providing the first evidence that p140Cap is a novel negative regulator of tumour growth."
19763173,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,ATMIN defines an NBS1-independent pathway of ATM signalling.,"The checkpoint kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) transduces genomic stress signals to halt cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair in response to DNA damage. Here, we report the characterisation of an essential cofactor for ATM, ATMIN (ATM INteracting protein). ATMIN interacts with ATM through a C-terminal motif, which is also present in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)1. ATMIN and ATM co-localised in response to ATM activation by chloroquine and hypotonic stress, but not after induction of double-strand breaks by ionising radiation (IR). ATM/ATMIN complex disruption by IR was attenuated in cells with impaired NBS1 function, suggesting competition of NBS1 and ATMIN for ATM binding. ATMIN protein levels were reduced in ataxia telangiectasia cells and ATM protein levels were low in primary murine fibroblasts lacking ATMIN, indicating reciprocal stabilisation. Whereas phosphorylation of Smc1, Chk2 and p53 was normal after IR in ATMIN-deficient cells, basal ATM activity and ATM activation by hypotonic stress and inhibition of DNA replication was impaired. Thus, ATMIN defines a novel NBS1-independent pathway of ATM signalling."
19763182,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Individual CREB-target genes dictate usage of distinct cAMP-responsive coactivation mechanisms.,"CREB is a key mediator of cAMP- and calcium-inducible transcription, where phosphorylation of serine 133 in its Kinase-Inducible Domain (KID) is often equated with transactivation. Phospho-Ser133 is required for CREB to bind the KIX domain of the coactivators CBP and p300 (CBP/p300) in vitro, although the importance of this archetype coactivator interaction for endogenous gene expression is unclear. Here, we show that the CREB interaction with KIX is necessary for only a part of cAMP-inducible transcription and CBP/p300 recruitment. Surprisingly, individual cAMP-inducible genes with CREB bound at their promoters differed in their reliance on KIX and none examined showed complete dependence. Alternatively, we found that arginine 314 (Arg314) in the CREB basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain contributed to CBP/p300 recruitment and KIX-independent CREB transactivation function. This implicates Transducer Of Regulated CREB (TORC), an unrelated cAMP-responsive coactivator that binds via Arg314, and which can bind CBP/p300, in these functions. Interestingly, KIX was also required for the full cAMP induction of a gene that did not require CREB. Thus, individual CREB-target gene context dictates the relative contribution of at least two different cAMP-responsive coactivation mechanisms."
19787036,0,Science,404511,2007,Abraxas and RAP80 form a BRCA1 protein complex required for the DNA damage response.,"The BRCT repeats of the breast and ovarian cancer predisposition protein BRCA1 are essential for tumor suppression. Phosphopeptide affinity proteomic analysis identified a protein, Abraxas, that directly binds the BRCA1 BRCT repeats through a phospho-Ser-X-X-Phe motif. Abraxas binds BRCA1 to the mutual exclusion of BACH1 (BRCA1-associated C-terminal helicase) and CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), forming a third type of BRCA1 complex. Abraxas recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to BRCA1. Both Abraxas and RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G(2)-M checkpoint control, and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM domains alone were capable of foci formation. The RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins."
19798728,0,Science,404511,2007,ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.,"Cellular responses to DNA damage are mediated by a number of protein kinases, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related). The outlines of the signal transduction portion of this pathway are known, but little is known about the physiological scope of the DNA damage response (DDR). We performed a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage on consensus sites recognized by ATM and ATR and identified more than 900 regulated phosphorylation sites encompassing over 700 proteins. Functional analysis of a subset of this data set indicated that this list is highly enriched for proteins involved in the DDR. This set of proteins is highly interconnected, and we identified a large number of protein modules and networks not previously linked to the DDR. This database paints a much broader landscape for the DDR than was previously appreciated and opens new avenues of investigation into the responses to DNA damage in mammals."
19805217,1,FEBS Lett.,155157,2007,Characterization of zinc finger protein 496 that interacts with Jumonji/Jarid2.,"Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified a cofactor of JMJ, the zinc finger protein 496 (Zfp496) that contains a SCAN, KRAB and zinc finger domain. Our molecular analyses indicate that Zfp496 functions as a transcriptional activator. Further, Zfp496 inhibits the transcriptional repression of JMJ and JMJ represses the transcriptional activation of Zfp496. This study demonstrates that JMJ physically and functionally interacts with Zfp496, which will provide important insights into endogenous target gene regulation by both factors."
19816097,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,Structural analysis of CsoS1A and the protein shell of the Halothiobacillus neapolitanus carboxysome.,"The carboxysome is a bacterial organelle that functions to enhance the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating the enzymes ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase. The outer shell of the carboxysome is reminiscent of a viral capsid, being constructed from many copies of a few small proteins. Here we describe the structure of the shell protein CsoS1A from the chemoautotrophic bacterium Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. The CsoS1A protein forms hexameric units that pack tightly together to form a molecular layer, which is perforated by narrow pores. Sulfate ions, soaked into crystals of CsoS1A, are observed in the pores of the molecular layer, supporting the idea that the pores could be the conduit for negatively charged metabolites such as bicarbonate, which must cross the shell. The problem of diffusion across a semiporous protein shell is discussed, with the conclusion that the shell is sufficiently porous to allow adequate transport of small molecules. The molecular layer formed by CsoS1A is similar to the recently observed layers formed by cyanobacterial carboxysome shell proteins. This similarity supports the argument that the layers observed represent the natural structure of the facets of the carboxysome shell. Insights into carboxysome function are provided by comparisons of the carboxysome shell to viral capsids, and a comparison of its pores to the pores of transmembrane protein channels."
19816102,0,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,7505876,2007,Functional characterization of human PFTK1 as a cyclin-dependent kinase.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are crucial regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle whose activities are controlled by associated cyclins. PFTK1 shares limited homology to CDKs, but its ability to associate with any cyclins and its biological functions remain largely unknown. Here, we report the functional characterization of human PFTK1 as a CDK. PFTK1 specifically interacted with cyclin D3 (CCND3) and formed a ternary complex with the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1) in mammalian cells. We demonstrated that the kinase activity of PFTK1 depended on CCND3 and was negatively regulated by p21(Cip1). Moreover, we identified the tumor suppressor Rb as a potential downstream substrate for the PFTK1/CCND3 complex. Importantly, knocking down PFTK1 expression by using siRNA caused cell cycle arrest at G(1), whereas ectopic expression of PFTK1 promoted cell proliferation. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that PFTK1 acts as a CDK that regulates cell cycle progression and cell proliferation."
19816126,0,J. Immunol.,2985117R,2007,Interaction of PRP4 with Kruppel-like factor 13 regulates CCL5 transcription.,"Activation of resting T lymphocytes initiates differentiation into mature effector cells over 3-7 days. The chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) and its major transcriptional regulator, Krüppel-like factor 13 (KLF13), are expressed late (3-5 days) after activation in T lymphocytes. Using yeast two-hybrid screening of a human thymus cDNA library, PRP4, a serine/threonine protein kinase, was identified as a KLF13-binding protein. Specific interaction of KLF13 and PRP4 was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. PRP4 is expressed in PHA-stimulated human T lymphocytes from days 1 and 7 with a peak at day 3. Using an in vitro kinase assay, it was found that PRP4 phosphorylates KLF13. Furthermore, although phosphorylation of KLF13 by PRP4 results in lower binding affinity to the A/B site of the CCL5 promoter, coexpression of PRP4 and KLF13 increases nuclear localization of KLF13 and CCL5 transcription. Finally, knock-down of PRP4 by small interfering RNA markedly decreases CCL5 expression in T lymphocytes. Thus, PRP4-mediated phosphorylation of KLF13 plays a role in the regulation of CCL5 expression in T lymphocytes."

We identified Arabidopsis thaliana NUCLEAR PORE ANCHOR (NUA) encoding a 237-kD protein with similarity to Tpr. NUA is located at the inner surface of the nuclear envelope in interphase and in the vicinity of the spindle in prometaphase. Four T-DNA insertion lines were characterized, which comprise an allelic series of increasing severity for several correlating phenotypes, such as early flowering under short days and long days, increased abundance of SUMO conjugates, altered expression of several flowering regulators, and nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA. nua mutants phenocopy mutants of EARLY IN SHORT DAYS4 (ESD4), an Arabidopsis SUMO protease concentrated at the nuclear periphery. nua esd4 double mutants resemble nua and esd4 single mutants, suggesting that the two proteins act in the same pathway or complex, supported by yeast two-hybrid interaction. Our data indicate that NUA is a component of nuclear pore-associated steps of sumoylation and mRNA export in plants and that defects in these processes affect the signaling events of flowering time regulation and additional developmental processes."
19820356,0,BMC Cancer,100967800,2007,The interaction of PP1 with BRCA1 and analysis of their expression in breast tumors.,"BACKGROUND: The breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, is implicated in multiple cellular processes including DNA repair, the transactivation of genes, and the ubiquitination of proteins; however its precise functions remain to be fully understood. Identification and characterization of BRCA1 protein interactions may help to further elucidate the function and regulation of BRCA1. Additionally, detection of changes in the expression levels of BRCA1 and its interacting proteins in primary human breast tumors may further illuminate their role in the development of breast cancer. METHODS: We performed a yeast two-hybrid study to identify proteins that interact with exon11 of BRCA1 and identified Protein Phosphatase 1beta (PP1beta), an isoform of the serine threonine phosphatase, PP1. GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to further characterize this interaction. Additionally, Real-Time PCR was utilized to determine the expression of BRCA1, PP1alpha, beta and gamma in primary human breast tumors and normal breast tissue to identify alterations in the expression of these genes in breast cancer. RESULTS: PP1 and BRCA1 co-immunoprecipitate and the region within BRCA1 as well as the specific PP1 interacting domain mediating this interaction were identified. Following mRNA expression analysis, we identified low levels of BRCA1 and variable levels of PP1alpha and beta in primary sporadic human breast tumors. Furthermore, BRCA1, PP1beta and PP1gamma were significantly higher in normal tissue specimens (BRCA1 p = 0.01, PP1beta: p = 0.03, PP1gamma, p = 1.9 x 10(-6)) compared to sporadic breast tumor samples. Interestingly, we also identified that ER negative tumors are associated with low levels of PP1alpha expression. CONCLUSION: The identification and characterization of the interaction of BRCA1 with PP1 and detection of changes in the expression of PP1 and genes encoding other BRCA1 associated proteins identifies important genetic pathways that may be significant to breast tumorigenesis. Alterations in the expression of genes, particularly phosphatases that operate in association with BRCA1, could negatively affect the function of BRCA1 or BRCA1 associated proteins, contributing to the development of breast cancer."
19847112,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,A genome-wide role for CHD remodelling factors and Nap1 in nucleosome disassembly.,"Chromatin remodelling factors and histone chaperones were previously shown to cooperatively affect nucleosome assembly and disassembly processes in vitro. Here, we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe CHD remodellers, the Hrp1 and Hrp3 paralogs physically interact with the histone chaperone Nap1. Genome-wide analysis of Hrp1, Hrp3 and Nap1 occupancy, combined with nucleosome density measurements revealed that the CHD factors and Nap1 colocalized in particular to promoter regions where they remove nucleosomes near the transcriptional start site. Hrp1 and Hrp3 also regulate nucleosome density in coding regions, where they have redundant roles to stimulate transcription. Previously, DNA replication-dependent and -independent nucleosome disassembly processes have been described. We found that nucleosome density increased in the hrp1 mutant in the absence of DNA replication. Finally, regions where nucleosome density increased in hrp1, hrp3 and nap1 mutants also showed nucleosome density and histone modification changes in HDAC and HAT mutants. Thus, this study revealed an important in vivo role for CHD remodellers and Nap1 in nucleosome disassembly at promoters and coding regions, which are linked to changes in histone acetylation."
19847117,0,EMBO J.,8208664,2007,Agrobacterium ParA/MinD-like VirC1 spatially coordinates early conjugative DNA transfer reactions.,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens translocates T-DNA through a polar VirB/D4 type IV secretion (T4S) system. VirC1, a factor required for efficient T-DNA transfer, bears a deviant Walker A and other sequence motifs characteristic of ParA and MinD ATPases. Here, we show that VirC1 promotes conjugative T-DNA transfer by stimulating generation of multiple copies per cell of the T-DNA substrate (T-complex) through pairwise interactions with the processing factors VirD2 relaxase, VirC2, and VirD1. VirC1 also associates with the polar membrane and recruits T-complexes to cell poles, the site of VirB/D4 T4S machine assembly. VirC1 Walker A mutations abrogate T-complex generation and polar recruitment, whereas the native protein recruits T-complexes to cell poles independently of other polar processing factors (VirC2, VirD1) or T4S components (VirD4 substrate receptor, VirB channel subunits). We propose that A. tumefaciens has appropriated a progenitor ParA/MinD-like ATPase to promote conjugative DNA transfer by: (i) nucleating relaxosome assembly at oriT-like T-DNA border sequences and (ii) spatially positioning the transfer intermediate at the cell pole to coordinate substrate-T4S channel docking."
19847124,0,PLoS Biol.,101183755,2007,Drosophila brakeless interacts with atrophin and is required for tailless-mediated transcriptional repression in early embryos.,"Complex gene expression patterns in animal development are generated by the interplay of transcriptional activators and repressors at cis-regulatory DNA modules (CRMs). How repressors work is not well understood, but often involves interactions with co-repressors. We isolated mutations in the brakeless gene in a screen for maternal factors affecting segmentation of the Drosophila embryo. Brakeless, also known as Scribbler, or Master of thickveins, is a nuclear protein of unknown function. In brakeless embryos, we noted an expanded expression pattern of the Krüppel (Kr) and knirps (kni) genes. We found that Tailless-mediated repression of kni expression is impaired in brakeless mutants. Tailless and Brakeless bind each other in vitro and interact genetically. Brakeless is recruited to the Kr and kni CRMs, and represses transcription when tethered to DNA. This suggests that Brakeless is a novel co-repressor. Orphan nuclear receptors of the Tailless type also interact with Atrophin co-repressors. We show that both Drosophila and human Brakeless and Atrophin interact in vitro, and propose that they act together as a co-repressor complex in many developmental contexts. We discuss the possibility that human Brakeless homologs may influence the toxicity of polyglutamine-expanded Atrophin-1, which causes the human neurodegenerative disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)."
19938376,0,Structure,101087697,2007,Structure of the calcineurin-NFAT complex: defining a T cell activation switch using solution NMR and crystal coordinates.,"Calcineurin (Cn) is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that plays pivotal roles in many physiological processes, including cell proliferation, development, and apoptosis. Most prominently, Cn targets the nuclear factors of activated T cell (NFATs), transcription factors that activate cytokine genes. Calcium-activated Cn dephosphorylates multiple residues within the regulatory domain of NFAT, triggering joint nuclear translocation. This relies crucially on the interaction between the catalytic domain of Cn (CnCat) and the conserved PxIxIT motif located in a region distinct from the dephosphorylation sites of NFAT. Here, we present the structure of the complex between the 39 kDa CnCat and a 14 residue peptide containing a PVIVIT segment that was derived from affinity-driven peptide selection based on the conserved PxIxIT motif of NFATs. The structure of the complex was determined by using NMR assignments and structural constraints and the coordinates of the CnCat crystal structure. The NMR analysis relied on recently developed labeling and spectroscopic techniques. The VIVIT peptide is accommodated in a hydrophobic cleft formed by beta strands 11 and 14, and the loop between beta strands 11 and 12, forming a short parallel beta sheet with the exposed beta strand 14 in Cn. The side chains of conserved residues in the PxIxIT sequences make extensive interactions with conserved residues in Cn, while those of nonconserved residues are solvent exposed. The architecture of the interface explains the diversity of recognition sequences compatible with NFAT function and uncovers a potential targeting site for immune-suppressive agents. The structure reveals that the orientation of the bound PxIxIT directs the phosphorylation sites in NFAT's regulatory domain toward the Cn catalytic site."
